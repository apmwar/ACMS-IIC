Amazon VPC	"Feature Availability: Transit Gateway Integration w\ DirectConnect Gateway
Hello,

There is a feature that I am wondering about:

Transit Gateway Integration with DirectConnect Gateway

According to documentation:

(https://medium.com/slalom-technology/next-generation-networking-with-aws-transit-gateway-and-shared-vpcs-9d971d868c65 )

and

(https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-use-an-aws-transit-gateway-to-simplify-your-network-architecture/ )

This feature is slated for release Q1 2019.

As we are nearing the deadline for that, I'm curious if it will be released soon.

Thank you."

Any ideas here?"
Amazon VPC	"Intermittent VPN connection from AWS VPN to Cisco ASA 5512
We have created a site-to-site VPN connection from our AWS account to Cisco ASA 5512 firewall.
The Cisco ASA 5512 firewall is policy based firewall. We have passed the downloaded configuration from AWS VPN management console and provided the same to the networking team who manages the firewall.

They have configured the Firewall on their end and we have one tunnel with status UP.
Though one of the tunnel is up, the networking team says that there is issue while bringing up the phase 2 of tunnel 1. Below are the issue details:

Reference IPs used:
AWS VPN Tunnel Outside IP: 34.250.X.X
Firewall IP: 82.X.X.X

The networking team had few queries:
1) Regarding the ICMP Phase2 association, from Cisco firewall side, networking team can see Encaps and no Decaps

      new-fw/sec/act#  show crypto ipsec sa peer 34.250.X.X
      peer address: 34.250.X.X
      Crypto map tag: Outside_map, seq num: 150, local addr: 82.X.X.X

      access-list acl-vpn-xyz extended permit icmp any 10.0.11.0 255.255.255.0
      local ident (addr/mask/prot): (0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0/1)
      remote ident (addr/mask/prot): (10.0.11.0/255.255.255.0/1)
      current_peer: 34.250.X.X


      #pkts encaps: 120, #pkts encrypt: 120, #pkts digest: 120
      #pkts decaps: 0, #pkts decrypt: 0, #pkts verify: 0
      #pkts compressed: 0, #pkts decompressed: 0
      #pkts not compressed: 120, #pkts comp failed: 0, #pkts decomp failed: 0

    They need to verify that traffic is hitting the VPN process on the AWS side, as from this perspective they are sending ICMP traffic and not getting anything back.

2) When Cisco Firewall is the initiator AWS is proposing 0.0.0.0 which Cisco firewall is specifically rejecting. Logs as follows:

    Apr 05 09:54:44 IKEv1 Group = 34.250.X.X, IP = 34.250.X.X, Static Crypto Map check, checking map = Outside_map, seq = 150...
Apr 05 09:54:44 IKEv1 Group = 34.250.X.X, IP = 34.250.X.X, Static Crypto Map check, map = Outside_map, seq = 150, ACL does not match proxy IDs src:0.0.0.0 dst:0.0.0.0
Apr 05 09:54:44 IKEv1 Group = 34.250.X.X, IP = 34.250.X.X, Error: dynamic map SYSTEM_DEFAULT_CRYPTO_MAP: any any not permitted.
Apr 05 09:54:44 IKEv1 Group = 34.250.X.X, IP = 34.250.X.X, Rejecting IPSec tunnel: no matching crypto map entry for remote proxy 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0/0/0 local proxy 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0/0/0 on interface Outside

    As the initiator, we are proposing specific subnets in Cisco firewall, which AWS is accepting. This means that traffic only works when Cisco firewall is the initiator.

So we have the following results:
 Cisco Firewall as Initiator, AWS responder – Phase 2 success
 AWS as initiator, Cisco Firewall responder – Phase2 Rejected

When the tunnel is built successfully this is the point where network suspects things will start working more than they were before. The problem is every time they look at this issue, they bring the tunnel up as initiator. The Phase 2 remains up and works partially till it expires

Amazon VPC	"Site-to-Site VPN -  On-prem network connectivity across AWS VPC subnets?
I've configured a single Site-to-Site VPN connection between my on-prem lab network and my AWS VPC subnet (see sample diagram at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/Examples.html#SingleVPN )

Site-to-Site VPN Connection configuration details

	On-Prem subnet:  192.168.0.0./24
	AWS subnet:  172.31.32.0/20

I'm able to ping private IP addresses both to/from EC2 instances residing in both subnets with no problems.

192.168.0.0./24  <------>  172.31.32.0/20   GOOD

However, I need to be able to also access my on-prem lab subnet from another AWS Subnet-- 172.31.64.0/20.

192.168.0.0./24  <------>  172.31.64.0/20

Is this supported or do I need another S2S VPN connection?  So far, I've seen and recorded inconsistent behavior. At one point, I was able to ping from 172.31.64.0/20 to the on-prem subnet 192.168.0.0/24.  It no longer works.  And as far as I know, I've never been able to ping from the on-prem subnet to the subnet 172.31.64.0/20.

I've had trouble finding any support docs regarding what seems to be a very basic issue. I may be missing something simple here, so any advice would be greatly appreciated.  I realize there may be limitations due to my on-prem VPN device, Meraki MX60 (does not support BGP, nor active/standby tunnels).  

Thanks in Advance.

Edited by: djl2 on Apr 8, 2019 2:41 PM

More info-- It appears my on-prem Meraki VPN device can support only 1 AWS subnet per VPN connection.  Final (dumb) question:  Is there any possible way to configure the network so that traffic from my on-prem network to the AWS subnet can be routed through to an additional AWS subnet?

From the AWS S2S VPN configuration text file--

! AWS hosted VPN solution is a route-based solution, since Cisco Meraki only supports policy-based solution you will need to limit to a single SA. So please make sure to 
! select ""yes"" for just one subnet, if you have more than one subnet, consolidate them into a single subnet before proceeding with the VPN configuration.

	Under Organization-wide settings --> Non-Meraki VPN peers
	Name: ipsec-vpn-0xxxxxxxxxxx
	Public IP: 18.x.x.x
	Private subnets: <vpc_subnet>/<vpc_subnet_mask>
	IPsec policies: Click “Default”, select “AWS” under the Preset menu and ""Update""
	Preshared secret: t4xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
	Availability: All networks"
Amazon VPC	"Re: Site-to-Site VPN -  On-prem network connectivity across AWS VPC subnets?
I found the answer for my situation.  It's quite simple actually (as I figured it would be).

On my on-prem network's VPN connection settings (Meraki device), I changed the ""private subnets"" value to use the entire VPC CIDR block value (172.31.0.0/16) instead of a single subnet CIDR blocK (172.31.32.0/20).  I'm now able to ping all AWS subnets from my on-prem lab network.

Final note:  Even though I was originally attempting access another single subnet from my on-prem network, I'm fine with allowing S2S VPN connectivity to all other subnets on the VPC as well."

Hi everyone,

I want to archive redundant VPN connections to my client network. I want to have both VPNs on at the same time.  If one VPN has problem (hardware / connection) then the other is still functioning as the backup.  My client host is in 192.168.xxx.xxx/24 subnet.

I enable VPN1 -> working
I enable VPN2 & keep VPN1 => both VPNs are on => working
I disable VPN1 & keep VPN2 => not working (I can't ping the IP in the destination subnet)


Please advise how to archive this with static route (I don't want to use BGP).

I can divide the destination subnet into 2 smaller subnets, host the service using 2 IPs and use load balancer in front of those IPs but then I need to pay for load balancer extra.

Amazon VPC	"Issues with S2S VPN using Cisco ASA 5525 (9.8)
Hi,

We are attempting to get a site-to-site IPSEC VPN tunnel running between our Cisco ASA 5525 CGW and a VGW attached to our VPC. We have everything configured using static routing which is propagated to the main route table associated with the subnet etc.

Tunnel phase 1 and phase 2 negotiation all appear correct, and the tunnel comes up etc, however, we are experiencing an issue with traffic traversal between the two encryption domains. If we ping the EC2 instance from a host on-premise, the tunnel comes up and the EC2 instance responds - at this point we can ping the same host from the EC2 instance, but no other on-premise hosts.

If we then ping the same EC2 instance from another on-premise host at the same time as ping #1 is running, ping #1 stops receiving any response from the EC2 instance, and ping #2 takes over - at this point we can no longer ping the first host from the EC2 instance, only being able to ping the second host that has taken over.  

The same behaviour is also seen if we utilise another traffic source i.e. when pinging from host 1 if we attempt an RDP connection from host 2, the original ping fails.

The network team have checked and double checked the Cisco configuration based on the VPN config that was downloaded from the AWS management console. They have also observed that traffic from both on-premise hosts is traversing (being sent) the tunnel, but that inbound traffic back through the tunnel is only seen on the active connection (as per the description above).

Has anyone experienced behaviour similar to this? Is it a problem with the Cisco configuration or a problem with the AWS end of the VPN? We have noted some other threads discussing Cisco ASA CGW devices with various problems/issues being described, but nothing that fits directly with the way that our traffic is traversing and creating connections through the tunnel.

Thanks."

Amazon VPC	"Pfsense public IP address
Hi all,
I've set up a VPC with public/private subnets and attached a PFsense instance to the  subnet. I need to get its public IP address to log into its web GUI to configure it, but I can only see what appears to be its ""private"" subnet address. How can I go about getting its public IP address to configure it correctly?

-Thanks!"
Amazon VPC	"When will the VPC client VPN be available in Frankfurt?
I would like to use the newly announced client VPN (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/clientvpn-admin/what-is.html). However it's not available in the Frankfurt region, but it's available in Ierland. Is their a date or timeline when the client VPN service will be available in Frankfurt?

Maybe it's possible to turn it on for our AWS account in this region?"
Amazon VPC	"Re: When will the VPC client VPN be available in Frankfurt?
The same question. I see no region limitations in documentation."
Amazon VPC	"IPSEC Tunnel up but can't reach networks from either side
We can ping both ends of the tunnel. AWS shows tunnel up and configuration looks good but pings or traceroute from either side fails. 

This is from a mikrotik router to AWS. Not sure but I'm not certain the static routes in the VPC are setup correctly; this is one area where the documentation and interface are confusing. We have two route tables in the VPC (why two?). The main one has:

Destination: 192.168.168.0/24	
Target: local
Status: active
Propagated: no 

On route propagation tab: 
vgw-098a9408c7a7644ef | test gateway	
propagation:Yes

**Second route table has: 

Destination: 192.168.168.0/24	
Target: local
Status: active
Propagated: no

Destination: 0.0.0.0/0	
Target: igw-07f6a79ff6d669caf
Status: active
Propagated: no 

On propagation tab:
vgw-098a9408c7a7644ef | test gateway	
propagate: Yes

Could I get someone at AWS to review the setup? VPC ID is vpc-0f67bbadf9545712c"

Problem solved. Problem was on other end."
Amazon VPC	"AMI Image from an Windows Snapshot it gets the Platform value ""Other Linux""
Created an AMI Image from an Windows Snapshot it gets the Platform value ""Other Linux"" instead of ""Windows"". This is affecting windows license activation, since the AWS Systems Manager KMS process requires the image to have the 'windows' platform.

Api ""DescribeInstances""
PropertySelector ""$.Reservations[0].Instances[0].Platform""
Property value from the API output is empty. Desired values: .

How can you change the platform for the instance from ""blank"" to ""Windows"" to allow it to be activated?"

Any suggestion ?"
