Amazon SNS	"SNS message Content-type?
Hi all.

I've tried to solve my problem by reading the AWS docs, googling, and trawling the forums without luck for some time now, so here goes. I'm puzzled about the content-type of the messages SNS is sending. Take for example a SubscriptionConfirmation message - here are the headers:

POST /sns-notification-endpoint/ HTTP/1.1
Content-Length: 1351
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Host: j-gw.com
Connection: Keep-Alive
User-Agent: Amazon Simple Notification Service Agent

(This data is captured with tcpdump.) I was wondering, isn't the message supposed to be of content-type ""application/json"" because that's what the payoad, i.e. request body, is?

Now, this wouldn't otherwise be much of a problem but I'm using Tastypie and it needs to have a correct content-type fed to it."
Amazon SNS	"Re: SNS message Content-type?
Am having the same problem myself. I'm using asp.net mvc3 which has binding to json but it expects application/json content-type."
Amazon SNS	"Re: SNS message Content-type?
Hello, 

My apologies that we did not respond sooner.  When receiving SNS  messages via the HTTP protocol the mime type will be text/plain however the structure of the messages is in the JSON format."
Amazon SNS	"Re: SNS message Content-type?
No problem. But is this an intentional feature, or something that could perhaps change in a future API version? Having to force Content-type to application/json is ""sub-elegant"" in my opinion."
Amazon SNS	"Re: SNS message Content-type?
Very simply, it was an oversight on our part.  It should have been 'application/json' all along but we missed it.  Now we have to find a way to change it to what it should be without breaking anyone's integration with SNS."
Amazon SNS	"Re: SNS message Content-type?
This is biting me too... For instance, Loggly requires the application/json header to be in place to leverage their JSON parsing/search capabilities.

Any idea on when SNS might have this sorted out?  Would love to subscribe a bunch of JSON services to SNS."
Amazon SNS	"Re: SNS message Content-type?
Sorry to resurrect this question from the dead.  However it was implied that a solution was possibly in the works... but I'm having this very issue.  I'm using NodeJs with the express node module, and the subsequent bodyparser function provided by the connect module it sits on.  

the bodyparser function doesn't accurately grab the post data from a subscriptionconfirmation request because there's no content-type in the request header.  Would it be possible to modify the SNS system to allow people sending subscribe requests to specify the value of the content-type header used to reach the target endpoint?  This parameter would of course be optional with a default value of null to preserve compatibility with people who've got existing integrations that function to their satisfaction.

In the meantime, for other people who find this question based on issues with bodyparser having issues with SNS.  I've got a modification in place in bodyParser.js in which I force the plugin to use application/json as the content-type under a certain condition

function mime(req) {
  if(req.headers == 'SubscriptionConfirmation' && !req.headers.hasOwnProperty)
  {
      req.headers = 'application/json';
  }
  var str = req.headers || '';
  return str.split(';')[0];
}

Amazon SNS	"Re: SNS message Content-type?
Thanks for providing a workaround for Node.js

The hangup with changing the content type is there is no way of testing if the change will cause issues with all of the http listeners/hosts that are out there. 

There are ideas on ways to fix this, and we are looking into them.

Amazon SNS	"Re: SNS message Content-type?
Please just fix this. text/plain is simply wrong. Many new user to SNS (like me) will have issues with this. The most users will not even notice, as they have there subscriptions confirmed."
Amazon SNS	"Re: SNS message Content-type?
I am using django and created an http endpoint like this (from some example).


def email_sns(request):
	msg = json.loads(request.raw_post_data)
	if msg == 'SubscriptionConfirmation':
        if process_subscription(msg):
            return HttpResponse('SubscriptionConfirmation OK')
        else:
            return HttpResponse('SubscriptionConfirmation Failed')
    elif msg == 'Notification':

def process_subscription(msg):
    try:
        urllib2.urlopen(msg).read()
        return True
    except IOError:
        traceback.print_exc()
        return False

When I create a new subscription in an sns topic using this endpoint, after sometime I get a ""Response contains invalid JSON"" error and the subscription remains in PendingConfirmation state. 

How can I explicitly confirm it. What is wrong with this?

Any link to python docs/api/implementation will also be very useful.

Amazon SNS	"Re: SNS message Content-type?
I just spent a couple of hours trying to figure out why Node.js + Express were not giving me a JSON body. Express (with bodyParser middleware) will not parse the body unless it has a proper content type.

Please fix this, Amazon!

Amazon SNS	"Re: SNS message Content-type?
Could the solution just be a simple content-type configuration that defaults existing subscriptions to plain text, but defaults future subscriptions to application/json? The user could manually switch between them if needed and there would be no alterations to the existing subscriptions unless manually switched."
Amazon SNS	"Re: SNS message Content-type?
I first came across this a few years ago when this thread was new. I see it still hasn't been addressed.

Personally, given the amount of fantastic engineers you have at your disposal I have a hard time seeing how we've gone 3 years without any visible attempt to address this.

Couldn't it be as simple as offering another SNS payload type, e.g. JSON-without-blunder? It seems a solution like that could have been easily implemented while maintaining existing subscription compatibility while allowing for a migration path and a proper version we can build new software from?

Let's get this fixed... it's not necessary and there are many options.

Amazon SNS	"Re: SNS message Content-type?
To workaround this issue we are using following ""middleware"" in node.js:

app.use(function (req, res, next) {
  if (req.get('x-amz-sns-message-type')) {
    req.headers = 'application/json';
  }
  next();
});

Amazon SNS	"Re: SNS message Content-type?
When using jersey with jackson, the wrong content type eliminates the automatic deserialization, and I didn't find a way to correct the incoming content type before jersey kicks in.

I created a filter now that reads the raw content and stores it in the context. In my Endpoint I use the raw data for extracting the payload data.

Filter:
try (BufferedReader buffer = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(containerRequestContext.getEntityStream()))) {
    containerRequestContext.setProperty(""rawInput"", buffer.lines().collect(Collectors.joining(""\n"")));
}


Endpoint:
Map body = new ObjectMapper().readValue(context.getProperty(""rawInput"").toString(), Map.class);


PS: but I would prefer to have a correct content-type, though ...

Amazon SNS	"Re: SNS message Content-type?
Very annoying ""feature"" which breaks Jersey/Spring MVC and maybe more framework's automatic deserialisation capability."
Amazon SNS	"Re: SNS message Content-type?
I agree that the current behavior is not entirely correct.
I'm pretty sure the text/plain bug wasted many hours and created a lot of frustration, so please do address the issue.

The simplest backwards-compatible fix would be to add 2 new protocols to SNS notifications:
http-application-json
https-application-json

What do you guys think?"
Amazon SNS	"Re: SNS message Content-type?
This worked for me instead
    if (req.header) {
        req.header(""Content-Type"") = ""application/json"";
    }"
Amazon SNS	"Re: SNS message Content-type?
This is a decent solution. However, it should be: req.headers['content-type'] = 'application/json'"
Amazon SNS	"Re: SNS message Content-type?
This is a good solution.

NOBODY CARES???

This problem can not be ignored for so long! It is not possible that Amazon does not care about the inconvenience that this ""little mistake"" causes to the developers."
Amazon SNS	"Re: SNS message Content-type?
I also ran into this today... 

Why is this not at least noted in the documentation? 

I understand that it may cause potential issues if changed. But maybe instead the documentation should adhere to your system actually does rather than what you wanted to achieve.

From a development perspective, we want to know how it works... not how you intended to build it."

Amazon SNS	"Re: SNS message Content-type?
Could this solution not simply be to allow headers in SNS subscriptions to be set? At a minimum, with the ability to override the content-type header, but beyond that, why not allow the subscription configuration to specify a set of HTTP headers that are added to the POST (and overriding some or all of the existing headers)?

I also like the previously suggested idea of making application/json the default content type for all new subscriptions, thereby guaranteeing that nothing that's already in place is broken."

Amazon SNS	"Android SNS FCM Push notifications.
Hi guys,

I recently started developing a project and something is unclear for me.
I want to integrate SNS, Lambda, an Android app and FCM. I want to trigger a Lambda function, which calls an API and sends the results to the Android app. The thing is, the whole token thing is unclear for me. 
I got as far as getting the token, registering an application endpoint, a topic and I've been able to get notifications, but the thing is that I do not want to register every device by hand. Is there an automated way in which every time the Android app starts (or a new user is logged in) it automatically subscribes itself and can get notifications normally, without me registering the Instance ID token?

I am new to this and I'm excited to learn more, but I haven't been able to get enough information on the topic.
Thanks to anyone who can help!

Yours truly,

For SNS I would need a topic for every single group chat? I must be missing something here. I've read through a ton of documentation and I am not seeing anything that allows users in a group to received the other group users messages via mobile push notification.

Amazon SNS	"SNS HTTP/S notifications are slow sometimes...
We're seeing delays receiving notification from SNS to our HTTP/S receiver. Sometimes it's a few seconds and other times it's upwards of 6+ hrs or longer. We're using SES to send emails and we have SES send the events (delivered, open, etc.) to SNS. When it's delayed / slow, we do receive the email from SES within minutes, but it's the SNS notification to the HTTP/S receiver that's taking hours at times. Is there a threshold limit that needs increasing or something else we need to do to speed this up?"

Amazon SNS	"SNS filters failing when string contains double quote (is this a BUG?)
I have a SNS Subscription with a Filter pointing to a lambda (I tried also with a SQS subscription with same results).

The problem is that when I try to include a double quote in one of the message attributes the Filter stop behaving as it should. The double quote is in an attribute that is not part of the filter,  but still causes the problem. Note: if you wonder why I pass a double quote, I really try to pass stringify JSON, but I isolate the issue to have a double quote ion the message.

This is the MessageAttributes that I pass that causes my filter to filter out my message:

{ 
    eventType: { 
              StringValue: 'nice_event',
              DataType: 'String' 
    },
    ctx: { 
             StringValue: 'anything',  //<---- GOOD 
             DataType: 'String' 
    } 
}


The following will not work
{ 
    eventType: { 
              StringValue: 'nice_event',
              DataType: 'String' 
    },
    ctx: { 
             StringValue: '""',  //<---- BAD
             DataType: 'String' 
    } 
}


The filter is:
    {
  ""eventType"": [
    ""nice_event"",
    ""another_nice_event""
  ]
}


I also tried:
{
  ""ctx"": [
    {
      ""anything-but"": [
        ""*skip*""
      ]
    }
  ],
  ""eventType"": [
    ""nice_event"",
    ""another_nice_event""
  ]
}


In case someone ones to verify, I have a couple of lambda, one that generate and publish the messages and another that consumes the message from the subscription.

The lambda used to generate messages:
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
 
exports.handler = async (event) => {
    const sns = new AWS.SNS();
    
    const _ctx =  'whatever'; // change to '""' to cause the message to be ignored.
 
    const attri = {
        eventType: {
            StringValue: 'nice_event',
            DataType: 'String',
        },
        ctx: {
            StringValue: _ctx,
            DataType: 'String',
        }
    };
 
    const publishPromise = sns.publish({
        Message: JSON.stringify({ msg: `from dummy lambda: ${Date.now()}`, date: Date.now(), attri }),
        TopicArn: 'arn:aws:sns:...........',
        MessageAttributes: attri,
    }).promise();
 
    await publishPromise.then(
        (data) => {
            console.log({ data });
            console.log(`MessageID is ${data.MessageId}`);
        },
    ).catch(
        (err) => {
            console.error(err, err.stack);
        },
    );
 
    return true;
};


And the lambda used to verify the subscription messages:

exports.handler = async (event) => {
        console.log({ event });
        console.log({ records: event.Records });
        for (let i=0;i<event.Records.length;i++) {
            console.log({record: event.Records[i]})
            console.log({sns: event.Records[i].Sns})
            console.log({attr: event.Records[i].Sns.MessageAttributes})
        }
    const response = {
        statusCode: 200,
        body: JSON.stringify('Hello from Lambda!'),
    };
    return response;
};

AWS changed how SMS messages are handled. They can now send SMS messages on mass to ""your mailing list"" or something similar. No Opt-In is required like it used to be, now it's an Opt-Out. There is also Promotional and Transactional messages. Transactional have a higher chance of delivery.

Prior to this change we used the SMS to alert our sys-admins that something needs to be fixed or reviewed. They were all system critical messages and it worked without a problem for a very long time. But when AWS rolled out this new SMS system (at least on our account) all SMS messages were put to Promotional and the max cost was set to $1 (current cost per message is $0.00645 in the US). Thats 155 messages in a month.

To get this back working for us I changed the default message type to transactional and set the max spend limit to $500 (should be way over kill). While the link provided by Imthian@AWS ( https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns/v2/home?region=us-east-1#/text-messaging/preferences ) was correct, it was unclear what I was looking at since I didn't know they changed something.

It's frustrating when AWS makes changes that have deep impacts on how we use the services without announcing those changes. AWS did a good job of telling us that instance IDs and other such things were changing length but on the SMS change, I think they failed."
Amazon SNS	"Re: SNS suddenly stopped sending SMS
I've gotten evasion from AWS about the service upgrade. I tried to set my limit to $51, overkill for me as well, and I get back an email that 'this will have to be reviewed'.  And the messages are still not going out."

Amazon SNS	"Re: SNS suddenly stopped sending SMS
I also experience problems when sending out text messages when a CloudWatch alarm is triggered or even when I try to publish a text messages in the console. I get the following error:

Amazon SNS	"Re: SNS suddenly stopped sending SMS
SMS messaging worked again for me as soon as I updated my spending limit from $10 to $15. I was well within the free tier limit, so the spending limit was essentially meaningless. I switched back to $10 and SMS messaging continued to work.

My guess is that there was an SNS bug that discarded messages unless or until the customer spending limit profile was reloaded, and it wouldn't reload unless it changed. Changing the spending limit would trigger that reload.

SNS may have decided not to fix this on their side because it was November/December and they were locked down for the holidays, and there was an easy workaround (have the customer make a trivial change to their profile). If this guess is correct I just wish the SNS and support team had been more open and honest about the situation. Asking people to increase their spending limits when that seemed on the surface to be completely irrelevant is annoying."

Amazon SNS	"SNS to encrypted SQS queue possible?
I have set up an SQS queue with SSE and a subscription to an SNS topic.  The queue is currently using the default KMS SSQ key for encryption.

Answering my own question, this article: https://avinetworks.com/docs/17.2/aws-sqs-encryption/  got me started in the right direction (even though I am not using that product).

Hi DerrickLucid:
Thank you for reaching out. The http endpoint you used is an internal http endpoint. It can mean different things in different internal networks. SNS recognized it as an Amazon internal http endpoint and failed because SNS does not have permission to do so. Please use publish http endpoint instead. 

Best
Liang"
Amazon SNS	"Re: Can I use SNS with instances in my VPC?
""Please use publish http endpoint instead.""
Can you clarify?

Let me walk through the example a little more explicitly. I have a machine in a VPC with one network interface. The IP address of that interface is 10.0.140.70 for example. SNS is a pubsub service. The idea is that one node publishes a notification to a topic and several nodes can subscribe to that topic and SNS will send the notification to each of them. Machine 10.0.140.70 needs to subscribe to the SNS topic so it can receive the notifications that another node publishes.

Another machine with a public IP address can subscribe to the topic just fine and receive notifications. I am having trouble with the machine with a private VPC address. Is it possible? In other words, can SNS send notifications to machines in a VPC (without a second public network interface)?

Amazon SNS	"Re: Can I use SNS with instances in my VPC?
No solution yet. I may resort to publishing to an SQS queue per VPC machine, then polling the queue to get the notifications."
Amazon SNS	"Re: Can I use SNS with instances in my VPC?

At this time, SNS does not support VPC endpoints. We will take this as a feature request. Your approach of using SQS and polling from a machine within the VPC should work.

I believe 2018 is the lucky year. I finally see official doc on the resolution of this issue.

If you use Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) to host your AWS resources, you can establish a private connection between your VPC and Amazon SNS. With this connection, you can publish messages to your Amazon SNS topics without sending them through the public internet.

Amazon SNS	"Re: Can I use SNS with instances in my VPC?
That is only publish though? Not the subscription endpoint."
Amazon SNS	"Re: Can I use SNS with instances in my VPC?
That's correct.

Amazon SNS	"Re: Can I use SNS with instances in my VPC?
Instead of adding all the ""intermediary AWS SNS ips"", why can't AWS define a security group that has all the ips and we can add that security group to our ec2's. AWS can then modify these IP's as needed with supposedly a Lambda function they have. 
This topic has be around for so long and seems like AWS does not want to address this issue"

Well, no, ideally I should have my SNS running inside my VPC!"
Amazon SNS	"Re: Can I use SNS with instances in my VPC?
5 years later and I still think that this would be a really useful feature.

My usecase is that I have an ASG you might want to send a message to all of the machines in that group.

You can look up all of the internal IPs within the group and send a message directly to each, but that seems like a lot of boiler plate over SNS..."

Amazon SNS	"Integrate AWS SNS with FCM not working for iOS 🎈
Hi all, I am trying to integrate AWS SNS with FCM. What I wanted to achieve is to call SNS from my backend, then SNS call FCM to send push notifications to iOS and Android devices. It is working well for the Android Platform.

For iOS, I added a platform application for iOS, with FCM as the platform. 
I added a token to the platform application from my backend (call from iOS mobile app), but when I try to publish a message from SNS to the endpoint, the iOS device doesn't receive any push notifications. (The iOS device able to receive a push notification if directly send from Firebase messaging console, means the push notifications was set up correctly)

2. If it is possible to use FCM with iOS, what is the correct format of the message body in order to send a push notification to iOS (when the SNS Platform Application is FCM)? So far I tried but not working. Can please provide a sample data which I can publish from SNS?

Amazon SNS	"Duplicate Reports in SNS Daily SMS Usage Reports
I'm facing issue with SNS's Daily SMS Usage Reports

In order to get daily reports for SMS usage and to manage SMS bounces, I had configured SMS Usage reports using the below steps from SNS developer guide. 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sms_stats_usage.html 

From the usage report S3 Bucket, I had configured a Lambda function to trigger, which sends me daily report which is further analyzed for any errors.

From past few weeks, I got to see that I was getting duplicate records in my reports which was generated by lambda. I tried to troubleshoot this by having the trigger to SNS, so that I can see when new new log is added. I noticed that for each date's usage reports, the report was added twice by AWS.

example
On Mon, Feb 25, 4:11 pm UTC, SMS usage report was added for SMS sent on Feb 24
On Tue, Feb 26, 4:14 pm UTC, SMS usage report was added for SMS sent on Feb 24 again

Since the 2nd report had same name as of the earlier report, the earlier report got replaced with new file. This triggered the lambda and created duplicate records in my report. The new file had same data as of the old file 
i.e Report added for 24th Feb on 25th Feb was same as of the report added for 24th Feb on 26th Feb

If anyone can help me troubleshoot this duplicacy issue would be very useful as in SNS Console, there seems to not have any way to troubleshoot this."
