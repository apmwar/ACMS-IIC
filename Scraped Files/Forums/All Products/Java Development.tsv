Java Development	"Can't connect to SQL Server 2014 Express AMI
Hello,

When I use the RDP session I only see one Command Prompt window.  I don't see a Windows UI.  Is this AMI bad?

Additionally, I'm trying to remotely connect to the SQL Server that is provided by this AMI.  I have all ports inbound ports open but I can't figure out how to remotely connect and configure it.  I can connect to it locally in the RDP session.

Is there a default port for this SQL instance?

Java Development	"Re: Can't connect to SQL Server 2014 Express AMI
The AMI contains Windows Server Core Install : https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh846323(v=vs.85).aspx, so seeing only Command Prompt is expected.

By default the network services are disabled on SQL Server. Need to restart network services to be able to reach SQL Server (port 1443) from outside server.

Following is the way to enable the networking service:
1. Use netstat -a -b to verify port 1433 is not LISTENING
2. Run C:\Windows\SysWOW64\SQLServerManager12.msc from cmd.exe to open SQL Server 2014 Configuration Manager
3. Follow Steps in Microsoft Article   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/enable-or-disable-a-server-network-protocol?view=sql-server-2017  to check the network status, enable, and restart SQL Server
4. After SQL Server restart, check for port status using netstat -a -b
5. Should be able to connect from other servers after that, off course assuming the port is allowed.

Hope this helps."

Hi.

We have plans to run our application in China region and would like to have some information about possible issues there.

From what I already got - we can't have simple VPN from our EU to CH region. Is it correct?

Our infrastructure includes;

a) Maven to build Java code and Docker images;
b) Docker images to be saved in private registry (CBCcom? As Docker Hub will be too slow);
c) Packer to build AMIs adding Docker images inside;
d) Terraform to update ELB stack with new instances from Packer's AMIs.

As we seem will have EU <=> CN connection issues - currently, we plan to move Jenkins CI to CN instance.

But there are other issues as well:

1. `apt-get install maven` took about 2-3 hours to download all dependencies;
2. `mvn build` hangs on downloading Maven/Java dependencies;
3. an `ssh` connection to EC2 in CN too slow - can't even type commands (I'm writing them in a text editor, and then copy-paste to the terminal).

That's only a few I found at this moment (working from Kiev, not in CH yet).

Maybe somebody had a similar task and have some solution there?

We'd be happy to help as these are common challenges - downloading from foreign mirrors (wait until you try NPM) is a challenge - on your other issues:

1. `apt-get install maven` took about 2-3 hours to download all dependencies;

Yes - careful mirror selection is critical here; there are some choices.

2. `mvn build` hangs on downloading Maven/Java dependencies;

Best to mirror  - we also do local caching on Jenkins some times for this.

3. an `ssh` connection to EC2 in CN too slow - can't even type commands (I'm writing them in a text editor, and then copy-paste to the terminal).

This is usually a routing issue - try going indirectly to Korea or Japan or if in Europe, Singapore first then to Bejing - can make a huge difference.

Java Development	"Re: AWS Status page improvement (JSON and CORS support)
Here is the answer from the AWS engineer contacted through my company :

The JSON version of the AWS Status data that you found is actually an undocumented, internal API that the web page uses.
The official and supported programmatic way of getting AWS status information is to use the various RSS feeds that you see on the page to the right of the table entries.
As you can see, the RSS feed URLs follow a simple naming convention, so you don't need to copy paste them into a large table, instead, you can use any of the popular RSS feed parsers and a few for loops to cycle through all the regions and services that interest you and retrieve their status information.

Hello,

Hi,I've setup the eclipse toolkit and it is listing my instance but the key pair has a big red 'x' next to its name.  I can also not connect to the instance via the eclipse toolkit. Everything works well in the aws console or elasticfox.  I have the keys in ~/.ec2/ in which they should be detected automatically. What am I missing?  How can I fix this?- Markus"
Java Development	"Re: key pair in eclipse toolkit
Hey Markus,

that red 'x' definitely means the toolkit can't find your private key, just like you mentioned.  

There's two ways to take care of this:
 1 - ensure that the corresponding private keys live in ~/.ec2/ and that the file name is in the form ""<key-name>.pem"" .   It sounds like you've already got your keys in the right directory, so I'm guessing maybe they just have a different file extension?  Some private keys on windows/mac tend to use different extensions depending on which platform they're created for, so maybe the toolkit needs to be aware of that and accept other extensions, too.  If that's what's happening to you, i'll open a bug report so we can add that feature.

 2 - If you can get to EC2 Key Pair widget (in the Launch Wizard for example), you can right click on the key pair and click the ""Select private key file"" menu item to explicitly map a private key to a key pair.  I've got a change open to make it easier to get to that Key Pair widget from the preferences, but until that's submitted and built, you can find it on the Launch Wizard.

Let us know if that helps and if you have any other feedback,

We've done extensive testing with other AWS accounts that we use and there doesn't seem to be any problem.  Its just one of the accounts we use.  From different geographic locations, and various ports, we are unable to connect after allowing access using the AWS management console.

Furthermore, when we delete existing rules, the access remains, for example we blocked the ping/icmp ports and are still able to ping from hosts that should not have access.

this sounds like a tricky one...  I had to search around for info on NTLM, and after searching I found the docs you must have found describing how to disable Apache HttpClient (which doesn't support NTLM), so that Eclipse uses URLConnection (which does support NTLM) when you use the Eclipse Update Manager:
http://wiki.eclipse.org/ECF_Filetransfer_Support_for_NTLMv2_Proxies

Once you get the plugin installed, it uses the AWS client libraries to community with Amazon SimpleDB, which relies on Apache HttpClient, which doesn't support NTLM.

There's not an easy way to change the AWS SimpleDB library to use an HTTP client that supports NTLM, but...

you could try using a free NTLM proxy like Cntlm:
http://cntlm.sourceforge.net/

with that, you should be able to start up the Cntlm proxy on your computer, and tell eclipse to use it as a proxy instead of directly hitting the NTLM proxy.  Cntlm acts as a SOCKS5 proxy, which Apache HttpClient does support."

http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/ClientConfiguration.html

There are some additional proxy settings there, although from what I remember, for SOCKS proxies, setting the system properties should work.

Also in ClientConfiguration, you can set the default protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) clients will use to connect to AWS:
http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/ClientConfiguration.html#setProtocol(com.amazonaws.Protocol)

You could try changing that to Protocol.HTTP (the default is HTTPS) and see if that works better with your network configuration.

To use a custom ClientConfiguration object, just pass it in to the AmazonS3Client constructor when you create your client object.

hope that helps.  let us know how it goes,

Hello,

We decided to buy reserved instance m1.large windows server for three years term (Heavy Utilization Reserved Instance). And in your table it shows 1700$ / 3year.
I want to know 
is there  any other charges in addition to this $1700?
because table shows 0.16$/hour for windoews usage . what is this?

Regards
saravana"
Java Development	"Re: reserved instance
Hi pixelsaravana,

That is your hourly rate.  Since you purchased a Heavy Utilization RI, you will pay this hourly rate regardless of whether you launch an instance with the covered RI parameters or not.

So for example in March there are 31 X 24 = 744 hours.  If the term of the RI covers the entire month of March, you would pay 744 X $0.16/hour or $119.04 in hourly charges.  

A One-Time up front non-refundable RI charge gives you the option to later run instances at lower hourly rates than list prices.  For Heavy RIs, you pay the hourly rates whether you run the an instance on the covered parameters or not.

On the PuTTYgen ""panel"" in the ""Actions"" section press the bigbutton that says ""Load"" to load an existing private key file. Point itto your id_rsa-gsg-keypair.4. In the same part of the PuTTYgen interface, click on the big buttonthat says ""Save in Private key"" to save the generated key. 5. In the resulting dialog box, navigate to your home directory inC:\Documents and Settings[username] (not ""My Documents"" but thedirectory above it.). Make a directory called ""ec2-keys"" and finallysave the file as ""gsg-keypair.ppk""6. You should now be able to connect to a listed instance with PuTTYssh by just pushing the magic button. Of course, this connects you as ROOT from within your WEB BROWSER so use your new terminal to change your root certificate and set up a user account with admin permissions. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!"

Help anyone? Thanks"
Java Development	"Re: How to transfer a domain name I own to Amazon (EC2)
You don't transfer your domain name to AWS.  Rather allocate an Elastic IP address and the associate it to your instance.  Then go to your domain provider and point your domain to the Elastic IP address.  You don't need to transfer your domain to AWS.  You can do this from the AWS management console.In this way, you can start a second instance and test any application updates, then just move the Elastic IP to the second instance without having to make any changes with your domain provider."

Java Development	"Re: How to transfer a domain name I own to Amazon (EC2)
As BrianW@AWS said, you don't transfer the domain name to AWS. They are not a domain registrar. What you want to do is modify the DNS records. If you haven't purchased a DNS service from a third party, then this is probably provided by your current domain registrar. You need to locate any web control panel they might have provided you with or ask them how to update DNS records.

Let's say you want to host your domain www.example.com at AWS. First you launch an EC2 instance, and configure it according to your requirements. In this example you might want to serve web pages for www.example.com, so you install a web server. You will also need a static IP address. AWS calls them Elastic IPs. Get one using the AWS management console and assign to your running instance. Done! You can now go back to your DNS service provider / domain registrar and (ask them to) add an A record for your Elastic IP. Then all requests for www.example.com will be sent to your instance.

There are other hosting options available as well. If you want to host a static website, you can take a look at S3 instead of EC2. Maybe you don't even want to host a website - I just assumed that's what you were looking for."

Java Development	"Re: Free Instance on EC2 ?
Hi Bruce,

Recently I saw the EC2 Pricing mentioned

"" 
Free Tier

As part of AWS’s Free Usage Tier, new AWS customers can get started with Amazon EC2 for free. Upon sign-up, new AWS customers receive the following EC2 services each month for one year:

750 hours of EC2 running Linux/Unix Micro instance usage
750 hours of Elastic Load Balancing plus 15 GB data processing
10 GB of Amazon Elastic Block Storage (EBS) plus 1 million IOs, 1 GB snapshot storage, 10,000 snapshot Get Requests and 1,000 snapshot Put Requests
15 GB of bandwidth in and 15 GB of bandwidth out aggregated across all AWS services

Java Development	"Eclipse AWS Plugin & Tomcat Max Memory
All,First off, I'm new to AWS.I am playing around with EC2 and Tomcat WebApps, is there any way to increase the max heap size?  Generally you could do that via the launch configuration for your servet [Tomcat].  But for EC2 Tomcat, the launch configuration doesn't have that capability.So, is there any way to increase the heapsize (-Xmx) for the JVM that will run tomcat?Cheers."

In the launch config, it does sayfor additional configuration, open the server's editor under ""server"" view.More Info:I am using eclipse 3.5Under MacOSX.If I click on the EC2 cluster, I can do ""show in > debug or console"".  Nothing happens when I do that.If I click open, then it goes to the server overview page..."

Java Development	"Re: Eclipse AWS Plugin & Tomcat Max Memory
Hello,

I know this thread is a bit old, but I would like to revive it because I too am in a situation where I absolutely need to increase the max heap size of my Tomcat WebApp.

I understand that the Eclipse plugin does not allow for this configuration. Here are two possible alternative approaches:

1) Forget about the Eclipse plugin and do everything manually.
2) Create a modified AIM in which the max heap size is set via some environment variables.

Neither option is great, and I'm not sure whether 2) is even possible. So, to my question: does anybody have any suggestions as to how to best go about this?

Any pointers would be greatly appreciated; it is very frustrating that such a simple configuration is so cumbersome.

Thanks,
Michael."

Hey Michael,

just wanted to make sure you saw that we released AWS Elastic Beanstalk (http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk) last week, along with a big update to the Eclipse tools.

This is a big step up in performance and reliability for deploying Java web applications using the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse, and you'll have access to tweak much more configuration, such as JVM settings.

There's a quick screencast showing the new Eclipse functionality here:

Java Development	"Eclipse Tutorial - Unable to run project
Hi,I am new to the elastic cloud and am trying it out with a view to using it in forthcoming projects.  I started off going though the ""Getting Started with Amazon EC2 Management in Eclipse"" article (from the AWE Toolkit for Eclipse page).I created the application and it successfully runs from eclipse using a local Tomcat instance - no issues.  I then created the server exactly as in the tutorial (5 instances, no elastic ip, same security group (all zeros in each entry), ami-11ca2d78 etc).  The instances all start up and I am able to successfully secure shell into them.When I run the application on this Amazon cluster, I get a message in the Eclipse browser- ""503 Service Unavailable - No server is available to handle this request"".  I have tried several times yesterdayand today and still get this message.I also tried defining a single server (same AMI) in case it was the cluster going wrong.  When I do this I get a message ""Navigation to the webpage was cancelled"" - on refreshing the page as the browser suggests, I get a ""This program cannot display the webpage"".I spent much of yesterday and today playing with this and have been through some other tutorials, each of which defines a single serverand each time I get this set of messages.  There is no difference if I add an elastic IP either.  I have tried on US West and East coast with the same result.I am not sure if there is a step missing somewhere, but I am running the app fine locally and following the steps exactly.  My bill is rising and I have not had a single application.Can someone help me get this working please ?Thanks in advance !"
Java Development	"Re: Eclipse Tutorial - Unable to run project
Hey srisom,

I'm not sure exactly what's happening, but maybe some of these ideas will help turn up a clue...

if you're having problems, simplifying is definitely a good idea.  It sounds like you've already tried with just a single EC2 Tomcat instance without an Elastic IP.  I'd stick with that to start off while you get everything figured out.

Make sure that you're right clicking on the servlet you want to run (whether in the editor or from the package explorer view) and selecting ""run as..."" -> ""run on servier"" then your EC2 Tomcat server.  Clicking directly on the project and selecting ""run as..."" -> ""run on server"" probably won't work because there isn't a default resource defined.

There might also be something in your network configuration causing problems.  If you have to go through a proxy server to get to the internet, you might have some problems using the Eclipse tools since they need to ssh to the EC2 hosts and configure everything.

Another problem I've run into is that port 8080 is blocked by some firewalls, so I have to change my Tomcat configuration to launch on port 80 instead (default is 8080 of course), and make sure that port is also open to CIDR IP 0.0.0.0/0 in your security group like you mentioned.

If you can ssh into the EC2 box, then you might try using curl or wget to hit ""localhost:80"" and see if you can access the server from there.  If so, then it seems likely to be a security group or network firewall/proxy issue.

Finally, don't forget to check the ""Error Log"" view in Eclipse to see if there are any clues in there.

hope that helps,
j"
Java Development	"Re: Eclipse Tutorial - Unable to run project
Jason,Thank you so much for answering and giving some pointers.  I have been through the points and discovered that:1) Right clicking is ok.  I am doing that on the servlet - if I do this and choose my local Tomcat then it all works fine.2) Don't think I am going through a proxy - certainly the browsers have no entries and I have never had to put one in for anything - so this is unlikely.3) I logged on with ssh and from the server tried both curl and wget on localhost ports 80 and 8080.  Both tools failed ('couln't connect to host' from curl and 'Connection refused' from wget).4) I went into the Tomcat/conf directory on the server and swapped both references to 8080 in server.xml to 80, set JAVA_HOME to /env/jdk, ran the shutdown in the tomcat bin directory (this gave a connection refused error) and ran startup without error.  I hope this is correct to change the port.  After doing this I got the same messages from wget and curl.  I tried restarting the Tomcat server from the server view in Eclipse but it terminated the entire server and started a new one (so I lost my port 80 changes).My security group has all zeros set for ports 22,80,443 and 8080.  My local error log is completely empty.I am guessing that the issue is something to do with the connection failures etc on the server but am in the dark as to next steps.Can you offer any advice / suggestions ?Much appreciated !"

Java Development	"Re: Eclipse Tutorial - Unable to run project
I have got a bit further on this.  I discovered by logging into the AMI and checking the processes, that Tomcat is not started.  Trying to start it (setting environment and doing a catalina start) causes a java stack trace.At this point I gave up on this AMI.  I have successfully deployed my app using the Java Web Apps in a Box AMI.  You cannot deploy directly from eclipse but you can export to a WAR file and load into tomcat with no issues.  I am going down that road unless the standard AMI gets sorted.Google 'Java development 2.0:Easy EC2' and follow the IBM step through."
Java Development	"Re: Eclipse Tutorial - Unable to run project
Hey srisom,I just checked out the IBM DeveloperWorks article you mentioned.  it looks like a great walkthrough for Eclipse/EC2/Java/Tomcat.  I'm glad you were able to get that setup working.I'm not sure why Tomcat wouldn't be starting up for you.  I'll see if we can reproduce that over here.  If you or others on the thread see this again, you can launch Eclipse from a command line with the ""-debug -consoleLog"" options, you should get debugging output in your terminal window from the toolkit that provides some clues as to what's happening when something goes wrong when Eclipse is launching the EC2 instances, pushing the application and starting Tomcat.  The output is fairly verbose, so feel free to private message it to me and I'd be happy to take a look and see if we can find any clues."

Java Development	"Re: Eclipse Tutorial - Unable to run project
Hey srisom,

very interesting that everything works from the browser, but not from Eclipse.  The internal Eclipse browser should be hitting the same URL, so I don't know what could be different.  You might check the URL inside Eclipse and see if it's trying to hit something different.  The error log view might also have something interesting if you haven't checked there yet for this issue.

Java Development	"Re: Eclipse Tutorial - Unable to run project
A Solution!! (I think)

I had the exact same problem, everything working fine locally but could get nothing to run on AmazonEC2. I too noticed from the shell log for catalina.out that tomcat wasn't started.

A day and a half later...

I found the problem to be my server runtime environment in eclipse when you set up the server. It was set as Apache Tomcat V 6.0, of course, but I was using the latest version (6.0.24) and this seems to be the problem. I downloaded an older version from the Tomcat archive (6.0.18) and added this when configuring runtime environments. Setting up an instance with this server runtime environment works!

I hope this helps anyone who stumbles along here.
But why does 6.0.24 not work!!?? Can this be fixed?"
Java Development	"Re: Eclipse Tutorial - Unable to run project
Thanks for that !!  Yes I downgraded my local Tomcat as you suggested - I did mine to 6.0.16 from the archive and it worked first time!  I don't actually run it locally - just on EC2 but this defo sorts the issue!Guess more and more people will start getting this as the currect v6 Tomcat does not work - thank goodness they archive the older versions quite a way back!"

Confirmed for me also - changing to 6.0.16 did the trick.

Java Development	"Re: Eclipse Tutorial - Unable to run project
Hey Lemis,

We just released AWS Elastic Beanstalk last week (http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk), which provides a really easy and highly configurable way to run Java web apps on AWS and have them automatically scale with load.

As part of that release, we did a big upgrade to the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse to support AWS Elastic Beanstalk.  We're still using all the same WTP tools in Eclipse, so your workflow shouldn't change much, but there is a new server type you can use: ""AWS Elastic Beanstalk for Tomcat 6"".

I'd definitely encourage you to try the new system; you should see much faster and more reliable performance now that AWS Elastic Beanstalk does all the heavy lifting.

There's a quick screencast showing the new Eclipse functionality here:
http://d1un85p0f2qstc.cloudfront.net/eclipse/elasticbeanstalk/index.html

and also a getting started guide for Eclipse here:
http://aws.amazon.com/articles/4412341514662386

Hope that helps!  Please try out the new tooling and let us know what you think.  It should be a big step up over the previous tooling in Eclipse,

Java Development	"Re: New S3 AWS Mgmt Console is loading and loading and loading...
Hi Carl,Why on earth would Amazon require access to a non-standard port for ANY console type of service?  Just use HTTP!  Any communication to the S3 service itself should be on your servers.Many, many companies that need to use this service have very strict and fixed firewall rules (e.g., mine).  Now I cannot use S3 at all at work, since it is nigh impossible to get the firewall access changed at this company.Surely this is a major design flaw that you plan to correct, right?  Right?"
Java Development	"Re: New S3 AWS Mgmt Console is loading and loading and loading...
Agreed - I'm working for a large corporate and have struggled to get approval for any work on the cloud at all - there is no hope of getting a non-standard firewall port opened!

We can work around this by using the command-line tools, but it's going to be a huge barrier to wider adoption of aws here.

The console was working fine with standard http proxy and firewall settings a few months ago when we evaluated Amazon as an option - why this regression?"

Hi Chris,

The S3 Console uses flash to talk to the S3 servers. This has been the case since the S3 console was first released. Given that the iPad doesn't have flash support, the S3 Console would have never been accessible from the iPad. 

As regards the folks having trouble loading the console, would you please provide the ID of the diagnostic report generated by the console test page, and we will investigate.

For those in corporate environments, we are working on a way for you to access the console without making any firewall changes. We will update this thread when new information pertinent to your access issues is available.

Hi tushev,

In order for a service to become active we must validate the credit card on file for the account.  You received a notification that the card was unable to be verified which indicates that the service is not active.

Once the credit card has been properly validated and the service is active you will have access to the management console.

You can update your payment information here, http://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/account/index.html?action=edit-payment-method

Java Development	"Feedback on the Manamement Console
Hello,

I would like give you some Feedback on the AWS Management Console.

Bugs:

Instances: After launching a new instance the final ""close"" button in the dialog does not work. Only the closing button in the upper right corner works. After that, sometimes the ""launch instance"" button does not work any more.
Security Groups: It is not possible to add a new custom rule with protocol, port and group. Only predefined ones or custom but without group or custom with group but without specific protocol and port. The html form fields are always cleared by JavaScript.
Security Groups: When you add rule to group A, the switch to group B and then back to A it says ""No records found.""
Sometimes the navigation ""AWS | Products | Developers ..."" in the upper right corner shifts down to the tab ""Amazon S3 | Amazon EC2 ..."".
Account, Personal Information: The form does not work with special characters, e.g. München (Munich).


My browser is Chrome 7.

Apart from this it would be great to add multiple security groups to one instance.

First EC2 page after login: Not everyone is an American and using the default region. So why is it displayed always the first time? Even for people just using e.g. eu-west-1. It would be much better to see the actually used EC2 region first.

Best regards,

Java Development	"Re: Feedback on the Manamement Console
Thanks for taking the time to give us feedback!  We will take a look and see what we can improve.

A couple things:

You can select any number of Security Groups in the Launch Instances Wizard (use cmd-click or alt-click on Security Groups).  

For custom Security Group rules, the Console only supports Group rules or protocol/port/cidr rules.
That is, if you specify another group in your rule, you are allowing instances in the target group full access to the instances in the allowing group.
Security Groups are a confusing topic, we hope to improve the UI for them in the future.

And finally, yes, the navigation (and other things) may compress in funny ways if the browser width is too narrow.

The AMI contains Windows Server Core Install : https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh846323(v=vs.85).aspx, so seeing only Command Prompt is expected.

By default the network services are disabled on SQL Server. Need to restart network services to be able to reach SQL Server (port 1443) from outside server.

Following is the way to enable the networking service:
1. Use netstat -a -b to verify port 1433 is not LISTENING
2. Run C:\Windows\SysWOW64\SQLServerManager12.msc from cmd.exe to open SQL Server 2014 Configuration Manager
3. Follow Steps in Microsoft Article   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/enable-or-disable-a-server-network-protocol?view=sql-server-2017  to check the network status, enable, and restart SQL Server
4. After SQL Server restart, check for port status using netstat -a -b
5. Should be able to connect from other servers after that, off course assuming the port is allowed.

Here is the answer from the AWS engineer contacted through my company :

The JSON version of the AWS Status data that you found is actually an undocumented, internal API that the web page uses.
The official and supported programmatic way of getting AWS status information is to use the various RSS feeds that you see on the page to the right of the table entries.
As you can see, the RSS feed URLs follow a simple naming convention, so you don't need to copy paste them into a large table, instead, you can use any of the popular RSS feed parsers and a few for loops to cycle through all the regions and services that interest you and retrieve their status information.

Hi,I've setup the eclipse toolkit and it is listing my instance but the key pair has a big red 'x' next to its name.  I can also not connect to the instance via the eclipse toolkit. Everything works well in the aws console or elasticfox.  I have the keys in ~/.ec2/ in which they should be detected automatically. What am I missing?  How can I fix this?- Markus"
Java Development	"Re: key pair in eclipse toolkit
Hey Markus,

that red 'x' definitely means the toolkit can't find your private key, just like you mentioned.  

There's two ways to take care of this:
 1 - ensure that the corresponding private keys live in ~/.ec2/ and that the file name is in the form ""<key-name>.pem"" .   It sounds like you've already got your keys in the right directory, so I'm guessing maybe they just have a different file extension?  Some private keys on windows/mac tend to use different extensions depending on which platform they're created for, so maybe the toolkit needs to be aware of that and accept other extensions, too.  If that's what's happening to you, i'll open a bug report so we can add that feature.

 2 - If you can get to EC2 Key Pair widget (in the Launch Wizard for example), you can right click on the key pair and click the ""Select private key file"" menu item to explicitly map a private key to a key pair.  I've got a change open to make it easier to get to that Key Pair widget from the preferences, but until that's submitted and built, you can find it on the Launch Wizard.

Let us know if that helps and if you have any other feedback,

We've done extensive testing with other AWS accounts that we use and there doesn't seem to be any problem.  Its just one of the accounts we use.  From different geographic locations, and various ports, we are unable to connect after allowing access using the AWS management console.  We also tested ElasticFox and the java CLI api, and we have the same result.  

Furthermore, when we delete existing rules, the access remains, for example we blocked the ping/icmp ports and are still able to ping from hosts that should not have access.

this sounds like a tricky one...

http://wiki.eclipse.org/ECF_Filetransfer_Support_for_NTLMv2_Proxies

Once you get the plugin installed, it uses the AWS client libraries to community with Amazon SimpleDB, which relies on Apache HttpClient, which doesn't support NTLM.

There's not an easy way to change the AWS SimpleDB library to use an HTTP client that supports NTLM, but...

you could try using a free NTLM proxy like Cntlm:
http://cntlm.sourceforge.net/

with that, you should be able to start up the Cntlm proxy on your computer, and tell eclipse to use it as a proxy instead of directly hitting the NTLM proxy.  Cntlm acts as a SOCKS5 proxy, which Apache HttpClient does support."

Even setting them manually in the program doesn't do anything.I suspect the firewall that I am trying to go through doesn't like some of the webservice traffic.  I need to ask a network admin to allow these kinds of connections.  Could you tell me which domains (endpoints) I would need to connect to and what type of traffic they should allow (REST/ SOAP) ???Generally SOAP and REST services work fine with our firewall so I am suspecting it has something to do with webservices over https.- Mark"

Java Development	"Re: AWS Toolkit for Eclipse: proxy problem
Hey Mark,

the very first thing I'd do is figure out exactly what your proxy settings are (i.e. SOCKS5 vs. HTTP, host, port, is a username/pass required, etc.)

For a SOCKS5 proxy, it looks like you already know what you're doing, but others reading this thread might find this link interesting: http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/net/proxies.html

Next, check out the ClientConfiguration class in the AWS SDK for Java:
http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/ClientConfiguration.html

There are some additional proxy settings there, although from what I remember, for SOCKS proxies, setting the system properties should work.

Also in ClientConfiguration, you can set the default protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) clients will use to connect to AWS:
http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/ClientConfiguration.html#setProtocol(com.amazonaws.Protocol)

You could try changing that to Protocol.HTTP (the default is HTTPS) and see if that works better with your network configuration.

To use a custom ClientConfiguration object, just pass it in to the AmazonS3Client constructor when you create your client object.

hope that helps.  let us know how it goes,

Hello,

We decided to buy reserved instance m1.large windows server for three years term (Heavy Utilization Reserved Instance). And in your table it shows 1700$ / 3year.

is there  any other charges in addition to this $1700?
because table shows 0.16$/hour for windoews usage . what is this?

Regards
saravana"
Java Development	"Re: reserved instance
Hi pixelsaravana,

That is your hourly rate.  Since you purchased a Heavy Utilization RI, you will pay this hourly rate regardless of whether you launch an instance with the covered RI parameters or not.

So for example in March there are 31 X 24 = 744 hours.  If the term of the RI covers the entire month of March, you would pay 744 X $0.16/hour or $119.04 in hourly charges.  

A One-Time up front non-refundable RI charge gives you the option to later run instances at lower hourly rates than list prices.  For Heavy RIs, you pay the hourly rates whether you run the an instance on the covered parameters or not.

Get the id_rsa-gsg-keypair that you generated from your .pems onto your Windows machine.2. Find and open PuTTYgen.exe - mine was not in the PATH but in C:\Program Files\PuTTY3. On the PuTTYgen ""panel"" in the ""Actions"" section press the bigbutton that says ""Load"" to load an existing private key file. Point itto your id_rsa-gsg-keypair.4. In the same part of the PuTTYgen interface, click on the big buttonthat says ""Save in Private key"" to save the generated key. 5. In the resulting dialog box, navigate to your home directory inC:\Documents and Settings[username] (not ""My Documents"" but thedirectory above it.). Make a directory called ""ec2-keys"" and finallysave the file as ""gsg-keypair.ppk""6. You should now be able to connect to a listed instance with PuTTYssh by just pushing the magic button. Of course, this connects you as ROOT from within your WEB BROWSER so use your new terminal to change your root certificate and set up a user account with admin permissions. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!"

Java Development	"Re: How to transfer a domain name I own to Amazon (EC2)
You don't transfer your domain name to AWS.  Rather allocate an Elastic IP address and the associate it to your instance.  Then go to your domain provider and point your domain to the Elastic IP address.  You don't need to transfer your domain to AWS.  You can do this from the AWS management console.In this way, you can start a second instance and test any application updates, then just move the Elastic IP to the second instance without having to make any changes with your domain provider."

Java Development	"Re: How to transfer a domain name I own to Amazon (EC2)
As BrianW@AWS said, you don't transfer the domain name to AWS. They are not a domain registrar. What you want to do is modify the DNS records. If you haven't purchased a DNS service from a third party, then this is probably provided by your current domain registrar. You need to locate any web control panel they might have provided you with or ask them how to update DNS records.

Let's say you want to host your domain www.example.com at AWS. First you launch an EC2 instance, and configure it according to your requirements. In this example you might want to serve web pages for www.example.com, so you install a web server. You will also need a static IP address. AWS calls them Elastic IPs. Get one using the AWS management console and assign to your running instance. Done! You can now go back to your DNS service provider / domain registrar and (ask them to) add an A record for your Elastic IP. Then all requests for www.example.com will be sent to your instance.

There are other hosting options available as well. If you want to host a static website, you can take a look at S3 instead of EC2. Maybe you don't even want to host a website - I just assumed that's what you were looking for."

Hi Bruce,

Recently I saw the EC2 Pricing mentioned

"" 
Free Tier

As part of AWS’s Free Usage Tier, new AWS customers can get started with Amazon EC2 for free. Upon sign-up, new AWS customers receive the following EC2 services each month for one year:

750 hours of EC2 running Linux/Unix Micro instance usage
750 hours of Elastic Load Balancing plus 15 GB data processing
10 GB of Amazon Elastic Block Storage (EBS) plus 1 million IOs, 1 GB snapshot storage, 10,000 snapshot Get Requests and 1,000 snapshot Put Requests
15 GB of bandwidth in and 15 GB of bandwidth out aggregated across all AWS services

I have downloaded the AWS plugin zip file from github - but not sure where I should extract it to as part of the eclipse folder. Am new to eclipse IDE. Can you please help? Thanks."
Java Development	"Re: AWS Toolkit for Eclipse Don't Work
Hey devdeals,

Try installing the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse from the Eclipse Marketplace client (""Help"" -> ""Eclipse Marketplace..."" -> then search for AWS).  That might be an easier way to get everything installed.

let us know if that helps,
j"
Java Development	"Re: AWS Toolkit for Eclipse Don't Work
Hi jason,
Thanks for the quick response.

Tried Eclipse Marketplace also. Am getting the same ""Read Timed Out"" error. Can I unzip the aws zip directory from github or sourceforge to install the plugin? If yes, which location in the eclipse program folder do I extract the zip file to?

I am on Windows XP SP3."
Java Development	"Re: AWS Toolkit for Eclipse Don't Work
Only the source is available through GitHub, you need the built plugins/features.  You should really use Eclipse's update manager, otherwise it's very easy to get your Eclipse install in a bad situation by installing plugins manually (ex: you won't get proper plugin dependency checking).

Are you able to view this URL:
http://aws.amazon.com/eclipse/site.xml 

Eclipse pulls that first, then pulls the individual plugin/feature zip files from Amazon CloudFront.

Try opening Eclipse's ""Error Log"" view and see if there are any stack traces or extra information available there.

Please find attached the Error Log when I try installing from eclipse marketplace. I am able to view the site.xml file."

All,First off, I'm new to AWS.I am playing around with EC2 and Tomcat WebApps, is there any way to increase the max heap size?  Generally you could do that via the launch configuration for your servet [Tomcat].  But for EC2 Tomcat, the launch configuration doesn't have that capability.So, is there any way to increase the heapsize (-Xmx) for the JVM that will run tomcat?Cheers."

Java Development	"Re: Eclipse AWS Plugin & Tomcat Max Memory
Hello,

I know this thread is a bit old, but I would like to revive it because I too am in a situation where I absolutely need to increase the max heap size of my Tomcat WebApp.

I understand that the Eclipse plugin does not allow for this configuration. Here are two possible alternative approaches:

1) Forget about the Eclipse plugin and do everything manually.
2) Create a modified AIM in which the max heap size is set via some environment variables.

Neither option is great, and I'm not sure whether 2) is even possible. So, to my question: does anybody have any suggestions as to how to best go about this?

Any pointers would be greatly appreciated; it is very frustrating that such a simple configuration is so cumbersome.

Thanks,
Michael."
Java Development	"Re: Eclipse AWS Plugin & Tomcat Max Memory
Hey Michael,

just wanted to make sure you saw that we released AWS Elastic Beanstalk (http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk) last week, along with a big update to the Eclipse tools.

This is a big step up in performance and reliability for deploying Java web applications using the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse, and you'll have access to tweak much more configuration, such as JVM settings.

There's a quick screencast showing the new Eclipse functionality here:
http://d1un85p0f2qstc.cloudfront.net/eclipse/elasticbeanstalk/index.html

and also a getting started guide for Eclipse here:
http://aws.amazon.com/articles/4412341514662386

Hope that helps! Try out the new tooling and let us know what you think,

Java Development	"Eclipse Tutorial - Unable to run project
Hi,I am new to the elastic cloud and am trying it out with a view to using it in forthcoming projects.  I started off going though the ""Getting Started with Amazon EC2 Management in Eclipse"" article (from the AWE Toolkit for Eclipse page).I created the application and it successfully runs from eclipse using a local Tomcat instance - no issues.  I then created the server exactly as in the tutorial (5 instances, no elastic ip, same security group (all zeros in each entry), ami-11ca2d78 etc).  The instances all start up and I am able to successfully secure shell into them.When I run the application on this Amazon cluster, I get a message in the Eclipse browser- ""503 Service Unavailable - No server is available to handle this request"".  I have tried several times yesterdayand today and still get this message.I also tried defining a single server (same AMI) in case it was the cluster going wrong.  When I do this I get a message ""Navigation to the webpage was cancelled"" - on refreshing the page as the browser suggests, I get a ""This program cannot display the webpage"".I spent much of yesterday and today playing with this and have been through some other tutorials, each of which defines a single serverand each time I get this set of messages.  There is no difference if I add an elastic IP either.  I have tried on US West and East coast with the same result.I am not sure if there is a step missing somewhere, but I am running the app fine locally and following the steps exactly.  My bill is rising and I have not had a single application.Can someone help me get this working please ?Thanks in advance !"
Java Development	"Re: Eclipse Tutorial - Unable to run project
Hey srisom,

I'm not sure exactly what's happening, but maybe some of these ideas will help turn up a clue...

if you're having problems, simplifying is definitely a good idea.  It sounds like you've already tried with just a single EC2 Tomcat instance without an Elastic IP.  I'd stick with that to start off while you get everything figured out.

Make sure that you're right clicking on the servlet you want to run (whether in the editor or from the package explorer view) and selecting ""run as..."" -> ""run on servier"" then your EC2 Tomcat server.  Clicking directly on the project and selecting ""run as..."" -> ""run on server"" probably won't work because there isn't a default resource defined.

There might also be something in your network configuration causing problems.  If you have to go through a proxy server to get to the internet, you might have some problems using the Eclipse tools since they need to ssh to the EC2 hosts and configure everything.

Another problem I've run into is that port 8080 is blocked by some firewalls, so I have to change my Tomcat configuration to launch on port 80 instead (default is 8080 of course), and make sure that port is also open to CIDR IP 0.0.0.0/0 in your security group like you mentioned.

If you can ssh into the EC2 box, then you might try using curl or wget to hit ""localhost:80"" and see if you can access the server from there.  If so, then it seems likely to be a security group or network firewall/proxy issue.

Finally, don't forget to check the ""Error Log"" view in Eclipse to see if there are any clues in there.

hope that helps,

Jason,Thank you so much for answering and giving some pointers.  I have been through the points and discovered that:1) Right clicking is ok.  I am doing that on the servlet - if I do this and choose my local Tomcat then it all works fine.2) Don't think I am going through a proxy - certainly the browsers have no entries and I have never had to put one in for anything - so this is unlikely.3) I logged on with ssh and from the server tried both curl and wget on localhost ports 80 and 8080.  Both tools failed ('couln't connect to host' from curl and 'Connection refused' from wget).4) I went into the Tomcat/conf directory on the server and swapped both references to 8080 in server.xml to 80, set JAVA_HOME to /env/jdk, ran the shutdown in the tomcat bin directory (this gave a connection refused error) and ran startup without error.  I hope this is correct to change the port.  After doing this I got the same messages from wget and curl.  I tried restarting the Tomcat server from the server view in Eclipse but it terminated the entire server and started a new one (so I lost my port 80 changes).My security group has all zeros set for ports 22,80,443 and 8080.  My local error log is completely empty.I am guessing that the issue is something to do with the connection failures etc on the server but am in the dark as to next steps.Can you offer any advice / suggestions ?Much appreciated !"

Java Development	"Re: Eclipse Tutorial - Unable to run project
I have got a bit further on this.  I discovered by logging into the AMI and checking the processes, that Tomcat is not started.  Trying to start it (setting environment and doing a catalina start) causes a java stack trace.At this point I gave up on this AMI.  I have successfully deployed my app using the Java Web Apps in a Box AMI.  You cannot deploy directly from eclipse but you can export to a WAR file and load into tomcat with no issues.  I am going down that road unless the standard AMI gets sorted.Google 'Java development 2.0:Easy EC2' and follow the IBM step through."
Java Development	"Re: Eclipse Tutorial - Unable to run project
Hey srisom,I just checked out the IBM DeveloperWorks article you mentioned.  it looks like a great walkthrough for Eclipse/EC2/Java/Tomcat.  I'm glad you were able to get that setup working.I'm not sure why Tomcat wouldn't be starting up for you.  I'll see if we can reproduce that over here.  If you or others on the thread see this again, you can launch Eclipse from a command line with the ""-debug -consoleLog"" options, you should get debugging output in your terminal window from the toolkit that provides some clues as to what's happening when something goes wrong when Eclipse is launching the EC2 instances, pushing the application and starting Tomcat.  The output is fairly verbose, so feel free to private message it to me and I'd be happy to take a look and see if we can find any clues."

very interesting that everything works from the browser, but not from Eclipse.  The internal Eclipse browser should be hitting the same URL, so I don't know what could be different.  You might check the URL inside Eclipse and see if it's trying to hit something different.  The error log view might also have something interesting if you haven't checked there yet for this issue.

A Solution!! (I think)

I had the exact same problem, everything working fine locally but could get nothing to run on AmazonEC2. I too noticed from the shell log for catalina.out that tomcat wasn't started.

A day and a half later...

I found the problem to be my server runtime environment in eclipse when you set up the server. It was set as Apache Tomcat V 6.0, of course, but I was using the latest version (6.0.24) and this seems to be the problem. I downloaded an older version from the Tomcat archive (6.0.18) and added this when configuring runtime environments. Setting up an instance with this server runtime environment works!

I hope this helps anyone who stumbles along here.
But why does 6.0.24 not work!!?? Can this be fixed?"

Thanks for that !!  Yes I downgraded my local Tomcat as you suggested - I did mine to 6.0.16 from the archive and it worked first time!  I don't actually run it locally - just on EC2 but this defo sorts the issue!Guess more and more people will start getting this as the currect v6 Tomcat does not work - thank goodness they archive the older versions quite a way back!"

Java Development	"Re: Eclipse Tutorial - Unable to run project
Hey Lemis,

We just released AWS Elastic Beanstalk last week (http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk), which provides a really easy and highly configurable way to run Java web apps on AWS and have them automatically scale with load.

As part of that release, we did a big upgrade to the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse to support AWS Elastic Beanstalk.  We're still using all the same WTP tools in Eclipse, so your workflow shouldn't change much, but there is a new server type you can use: ""AWS Elastic Beanstalk for Tomcat 6"".

I'd definitely encourage you to try the new system; you should see much faster and more reliable performance now that AWS Elastic Beanstalk does all the heavy lifting.

There's a quick screencast showing the new Eclipse functionality here:
http://d1un85p0f2qstc.cloudfront.net/eclipse/elasticbeanstalk/index.html

and also a getting started guide for Eclipse here:
http://aws.amazon.com/articles/4412341514662386

Hope that helps!  Please try out the new tooling and let us know what you think.  It should be a big step up over the previous tooling in Eclipse,

Java Development	"Re: New S3 AWS Mgmt Console is loading and loading and loading...
Hi Carl,Why on earth would Amazon require access to a non-standard port for ANY console type of service?  Just use HTTP!  Any communication to the S3 service itself should be on your servers.Many, many companies that need to use this service have very strict and fixed firewall rules (e.g., mine).  Now I cannot use S3 at all at work, since it is nigh impossible to get the firewall access changed at this company.Surely this is a major design flaw that you plan to correct, right?  Right?"
Java Development	"Re: New S3 AWS Mgmt Console is loading and loading and loading...
Agreed - I'm working for a large corporate and have struggled to get approval for any work on the cloud at all - there is no hope of getting a non-standard firewall port opened!

We can work around this by using the command-line tools, but it's going to be a huge barrier to wider adoption of aws here.

The console was working fine with standard http proxy and firewall settings a few months ago when we evaluated Amazon as an option - why this regression?"

Hi Chris,

The S3 Console uses flash to talk to the S3 servers. This has been the case since the S3 console was first released. Given that the iPad doesn't have flash support, the S3 Console would have never been accessible from the iPad. 

As regards the folks having trouble loading the console, would you please provide the ID of the diagnostic report generated by the console test page, and we will investigate.

For those in corporate environments, we are working on a way for you to access the console without making any firewall changes. We will update this thread when new information pertinent to your access issues is available.

Hi tushev,

In order for a service to become active we must validate the credit card on file for the account.  You received a notification that the card was unable to be verified which indicates that the service is not active.

Once the credit card has been properly validated and the service is active you will have access to the management console.

Hello,

I would like give you some Feedback on the AWS Management Console.

Bugs:

Instances: After launching a new instance the final ""close"" button in the dialog does not work. Only the closing button in the upper right corner works. After that, sometimes the ""launch instance"" button does not work any more.
Security Groups: It is not possible to add a new custom rule with protocol, port and group. Only predefined ones or custom but without group or custom with group but without specific protocol and port. The html form fields are always cleared by JavaScript.
Security Groups: When you add rule to group A, the switch to group B and then back to A it says ""No records found.""
Sometimes the navigation ""AWS | Products | Developers ..."" in the upper right corner shifts down to the tab ""Amazon S3 | Amazon EC2 ..."".
Account, Personal Information: The form does not work with special characters, e.g. München (Munich).


My browser is Chrome 7.

Apart from this it would be great to add multiple security groups to one instance.

First EC2 page after login: Not everyone is an American and using the default region. So why is it displayed always the first time? Even for people just using e.g. eu-west-1. It would be much better to see the actually used EC2 region first.

Java Development	"Re: Feedback on the Manamement Console
Thanks for taking the time to give us feedback!  We will take a look and see what we can improve.

A couple things:

You can select any number of Security Groups in the Launch Instances Wizard (use cmd-click or alt-click on Security Groups).  

For custom Security Group rules, the Console only supports Group rules or protocol/port/cidr rules.
That is, if you specify another group in your rule, you are allowing instances in the target group full access to the instances in the allowing group.
Security Groups are a confusing topic, we hope to improve the UI for them in the future.

And finally, yes, the navigation (and other things) may compress in funny ways if the browser width is too narrow.

Java Development	"Re: workdocs storage
Hello chris125163,

My name is MD. I'm the GM for WorkDocs application.

Thanks for reaching out to us and sorry for the inconvenience this issue may have caused. As you may know WorkDocs supports unlimited versions of a file. Although each version of a file may only be a few gigabytes, you can quickly consume all your allocated storage if you create many versions of the file. Storage quota is controlled and applied by your site administrator/s.

You have two options:
1. Easiest: if you so wish, you could contact your administrator (WorkDocs web application: Tasks > New Task > Contact Administrator) and request an addition to your storage quota.

2. If you do not wish to keep all the previous versions of the file, please follow these steps:

Download the file to your local machine to a temporary location.
Delete it from the WorkDocs folders (this releases all storage associated with the file).
Upload the file (from your temporary location) back into WorkDocs.
Lastly, and this important: Lock the file in WorkDocs. This will ensure that while updates are made the file and uploaded to the cloud, new versions are not created for each update.


Hope this helps. Apologies for the inconvenience once again.

Thanks,
MD."
Java Development	"Re: workdocs storage
Hi MD

Many thanks for your reply.  I have managed to increase my quota.  However, I am now paying for 1.4TB of data when I am actually only using around 800GB.

I have only uploaded my files once through the drive app so there should not be any other versions of these files.  No other users have any other than view rights.  I suspect what is happening is if there is a glitch in the connection when uploading, the file might start to upload again.  I suspect these partial files are being stored as file versions.  Because I am sending up large video files, these old, imcomplete files are using a lot of storage.

As you say I can delete them from work docs and send them again but it is more than likely that this same situation will occur.  Yesterday I uploaded 4 files totalling 54GB but the total showing in Workdocs is 93GB.

Java Development	"Workdocs - security of sharing problem
Hi

I have setup WORKDOCS, and have a few users.
Each user has powerUser role, apart from myself, admin.

I've setup a shared folder from my drive, to be used for the company shared docs.

There is a hierarchy to the folders in this, and only parts are intended to be available to various levels/individuals.  
For example,
Company>HumanResources>Personnel>StaffOneName

In the folder StaffOneName, I have documents relating to that individual ""StaffOne"".
I gave contributor access to our HR manager at ""HumanResources"" folder level, so the HR manager can save and change documents. create new Personnel folders, and so on.
I gave the individual ""StaffOne"" view access on the folder containing his information, intending that this is all he could access.

In testing via Workdocs web access, I found that ""StaffOne"" can navigate to his folder ""StaffOneName"", but then clicking on the cookie trail links, he can navigate up a folder level to ""Personnel"", then see and navigate down into other staff folders, (eg ""StaffTwoName"" folder) and see other staff member details.

Considering that ""StaffOne"" has not been given any access to higher level or other folders in this hierarchy, nor inherited access to this, he should not be able to do this

This is a major security issue, or  I've missed something understanding how this is supposed to work?  
The documentation on sharing is accurate, but there's no security discussion in those docs, nor suggestion that what I have encountered is possible nor intended. Naturally, security being paramount, that this apparent 'reverse inheritance', should not be possible.

I would appreciate some direction/comment. As a newbie to WORKDOCS, happy for your 'guidance' to my possible misunderstanding or oversight of something.

Java Development	"Re: Workdocs Sync Running..
Hello:

""On coming home i created two folders onto home laptop and installed sync and mapped to these folders""

We need to understand what particular actions where taken to ""map the folders"". There is no functionality in WorkDocs Sync client to map to 2 different folder. At any given time, Sync application can be configured to have one folder that will sync everything including 2 sub-folders that you have with WorkDocs.

As suggested previously, Please install WorkDocs Drive application from https://amazonworkdocs.com/apps.html on your home machine, and you will be unblocked to access all the content of WorkDocs on your home machine.

Hi hrshah,

Just to clarify, when I say they disappear I don't mean they blink and come back... although I have seen that happen (which was my first indicator it may be WorkDocs doing this to us).  In the three cases recently the icons and taskbar do not come back at all.  But as a follow up to that, I forgot to mention that on the one that happened while I was using the computer (opening WorkDocs), when I brought up the Task Manager there was no explorer.exe running on it.  So I just started a new explorer.exe and my icons and taskbar all came back.  So something with WorkDocs trying to restart explorer is not working right -- it's killing explorer.exe but not actually reloading it in some cases.

This problem still occurs after every WorkDocs Drive update, and only those computers that have shown the problem since it first started 5 months ago.  Other computers do not have the issue.

At least starting ""explorer.exe"" works, but it's kind of dumb to have to walk people through starting the task manager and then starting explorer.exe after every WorkDocs Drive update because they have no icons on their desktop.

When sharing a file or folder with a lot of users (who can add/edit documents and provide feedback), I would like to be able to share with a group/alias as opposed to manually entering each user. 

The WorkDocs instance is set up to Simple AD. Most of the users that need to access the files/folders are outside of my org. I saw in one of the WorkDocs guides that it's only possible to share with directory groups, not email distribution lists.

I found instructions to ""add users and groups to simple AD,"" but I was hoping there'd be a much easier way to create a group in WorkDocs. Is there? If not, I would like to make a request: please add functionality that will allow WorkDocs administrators to create groups/assign users to groups from the admin control panel in WorkDocs.

Hey all,

I've created a WorkDocs site and received the `Welcome to Amazon WorkDocs` email.

However, I'm not able to proceed from that point on. When I enter the password (as generated by my password manager, 100 characters), the form gets annotated with `Restrictions met`, but clicking `Update User` gives me the following error:

The password you have entered doesn't adhere to the password policy set by your Administrator. Please contact your Administrator for more details.

Java Development	"Location of new WorkDocs Drive on disk
Hi,
I was using the old WorkDocs and it's location on disk was C:\Users\akiyano\WorkDocs.
If I wanted to access it via WSL I could go to /mnt/c/Users/akiyano/WorkDocs/.

Now there is the new WorkDocs Drive that adds a W:\ drive and now the WorkDocs path is W:\My Documents.

A few questions about this:
1. It seems that these are 2 separate locations on the disk and the WorkDocs client syncs between them. So does this mean WorkDocs now takes twice as much place? If so how do I avoid this?
2. I want to continue using WorkDocs in WSL but the only drive WSL sees is C:\ how do I access W:\?

Thanks,
Arthur"
Java Development	"Re: Location of new WorkDocs Drive on disk
G'day Arthur,

The new WorkDocs Drive client, which has replaced the older sync client, presents the 'W:' drive volume as a network mounted drive. On Windows 10 under the Windows Subsystem for Linux network drives will need to be explicitly mounted before they're available.

You should be able to execute the following commands from your WSL bash prompt when you have WorkDocs Drive mounted and running:
$ sudo mkdir /mnt/w
$ sudo mount -t drvfs W: w
$ cd /mnt/w
$ ls

Here's the copy/paste of my command line entries and output in WSL bash:
streetp@******:/mnt$ sudo mkdir /mnt/w

The AMI contains Windows Server Core Install : https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh846323(v=vs.85).aspx, so seeing only Command Prompt is expected.

By default the network services are disabled on SQL Server. Need to restart network services to be able to reach SQL Server (port 1443) from outside server.

Following is the way to enable the networking service:
1. Use netstat -a -b to verify port 1433 is not LISTENING
2. Run C:\Windows\SysWOW64\SQLServerManager12.msc from cmd.exe to open SQL Server 2014 Configuration Manager
3. Follow Steps in Microsoft Article   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/enable-or-disable-a-server-network-protocol?view=sql-server-2017  to check the network status, enable, and restart SQL Server

Here is the answer from the AWS engineer contacted through my company :

The JSON version of the AWS Status data that you found is actually an undocumented, internal API that the web page uses.
The official and supported programmatic way of getting AWS status information is to use the various RSS feeds that you see on the page to the right of the table entries.
As you can see, the RSS feed URLs follow a simple naming convention, so you don't need to copy paste them into a large table, instead, you can use any of the popular RSS feed parsers and a few for loops to cycle through all the regions and services that interest you and retrieve their status information.

Java Development	"key pair in eclipse toolkit
Hi,I've setup the eclipse toolkit and it is listing my instance but the key pair has a big red 'x' next to its name.  I can also not connect to the instance via the eclipse toolkit. Everything works well in the aws console or elasticfox.  I have the keys in ~/.ec2/ in which they should be detected automatically. What am I missing?  How can I fix this?- Markus"
Java Development	"Re: key pair in eclipse toolkit
Hey Markus,

that red 'x' definitely means the toolkit can't find your private key, just like you mentioned.  

There's two ways to take care of this:
 1 - ensure that the corresponding private keys live in ~/.ec2/ and that the file name is in the form ""<key-name>.pem"" .   It sounds like you've already got your keys in the right directory, so I'm guessing maybe they just have a different file extension?  Some private keys on windows/mac tend to use different extensions depending on which platform they're created for, so maybe the toolkit needs to be aware of that and accept other extensions, too.  If that's what's happening to you, i'll open a bug report so we can add that feature.

 2 - If you can get to EC2 Key Pair widget (in the Launch Wizard for example), you can right click on the key pair and click the ""Select private key file"" menu item to explicitly map a private key to a key pair.  I've got a change open to make it easier to get to that Key Pair widget from the preferences, but until that's submitted and built, you can find it on the Launch Wizard.

Let us know if that helps and if you have any other feedback,
j"

Yes, it is a very broad question, but I would say that you can expect to find nearly everything around server management in the ""raw"" APIs.

We're having an issue getting firewall rules to work for just one of our four AWS accounts.  The rules appear to be created just fine, and we can see them and edit them without problems, however the port access is simply not being updated on the ec2 back-end. 

We've done extensive testing with other AWS accounts that we use and there doesn't seem to be any problem.  Its just one of the accounts we use.  From different geographic locations, and various ports, we are unable to connect after allowing access using the AWS management console.  We also tested ElasticFox and the java CLI api, and we have the same result.  

Furthermore, when we delete existing rules, the access remains, for example we blocked the ping/icmp ports and are still able to ping from hosts that should not have access.

My computer is behind a NTLMv2 proxy so I succeeded in installing AWS Toolkit only after I disabled the ECF httpclient provider.Now, my attempts to test my connection to Simpledb service fail so I guess the problem is due to the presence of this proxy, but I have no Idea how I can workaround it: can you help me?Thanks"
Java Development	"Re: AWS Toolkit for Eclipse: proxy problem
this sounds like a tricky one...  I had to search around for info on NTLM, and after searching I found the docs you must have found describing how to disable Apache HttpClient (which doesn't support NTLM), so that Eclipse uses URLConnection (which does support NTLM) when you use the Eclipse Update Manager:
http://wiki.eclipse.org/ECF_Filetransfer_Support_for_NTLMv2_Proxies

Once you get the plugin installed, it uses the AWS client libraries to community with Amazon SimpleDB, which relies on Apache HttpClient, which doesn't support NTLM.

There's not an easy way to change the AWS SimpleDB library to use an HTTP client that supports NTLM, but...

you could try using a free NTLM proxy like Cntlm:
http://cntlm.sourceforge.net/

with that, you should be able to start up the Cntlm proxy on your computer, and tell eclipse to use it as a proxy instead of directly hitting the NTLM proxy.  Cntlm acts as a SOCKS5 proxy, which Apache HttpClient does support."

Even setting them manually in the program doesn't do anything.I suspect the firewall that I am trying to go through doesn't like some of the webservice traffic.  I need to ask a network admin to allow these kinds of connections.  Could you tell me which domains (endpoints) I would need to connect to and what type of traffic they should allow (REST/ SOAP) ???Generally SOAP and REST services work fine with our firewall so I am suspecting it has something to do with webservices over https.- Mark"

Java Development	"Re: AWS Toolkit for Eclipse: proxy problem
Hey Mark,

the very first thing I'd do is figure out exactly what your proxy settings are (i.e. SOCKS5 vs. HTTP, host, port, is a username/pass required, etc.)

For a SOCKS5 proxy, it looks like you already know what you're doing, but others reading this thread might find this link interesting: http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/net/proxies.html

Next, check out the ClientConfiguration class in the AWS SDK for Java:
http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/ClientConfiguration.html

There are some additional proxy settings there, although from what I remember, for SOCKS proxies, setting the system properties should work.

Also in ClientConfiguration, you can set the default protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) clients will use to connect to AWS:
http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/ClientConfiguration.html#setProtocol(com.amazonaws.Protocol)

You could try changing that to Protocol.HTTP (the default is HTTPS) and see if that works better with your network configuration.

To use a custom ClientConfiguration object, just pass it in to the AmazonS3Client constructor when you create your client object.

hope that helps.  let us know how it goes,

Hello,

We decided to buy reserved instance m1.large windows server for three years term (Heavy Utilization Reserved Instance). And in your table it shows 1700$ / 3year.

Java Development	"Re: reserved instance
Hi pixelsaravana,

That is your hourly rate.  Since you purchased a Heavy Utilization RI, you will pay this hourly rate regardless of whether you launch an instance with the covered RI parameters or not.

So for example in March there are 31 X 24 = 744 hours.  If the term of the RI covers the entire month of March, you would pay 744 X $0.16/hour or $119.04 in hourly charges.  

A One-Time up front non-refundable RI charge gives you the option to later run instances at lower hourly rates than list prices.  For Heavy RIs, you pay the hourly rates whether you run the an instance on the covered parameters or not.

Get the id_rsa-gsg-keypair that you generated from your .pems onto your Windows machine.2. Find and open PuTTYgen.exe - mine was not in the PATH but in C:\Program Files\PuTTY3. On the PuTTYgen ""panel"" in the ""Actions"" section press the bigbutton that says ""Load"" to load an existing private key file. Point itto your id_rsa-gsg-keypair.4. In the same part of the PuTTYgen interface, click on the big buttonthat says ""Save in Private key"" to save the generated key. 5. In the resulting dialog box, navigate to your home directory inC:\Documents and Settings[username] (not ""My Documents"" but thedirectory above it.). Make a directory called ""ec2-keys"" and finallysave the file as ""gsg-keypair.ppk""6. You should now be able to connect to a listed instance with PuTTYssh by just pushing the magic button. Of course, this connects you as ROOT from within your WEB BROWSER so use your new terminal to change your root certificate and set up a user account with admin permissions. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!"

Help anyone? Thanks"
Java Development	"Re: How to transfer a domain name I own to Amazon (EC2)
You don't transfer your domain name to AWS.  Rather allocate an Elastic IP address and the associate it to your instance.  Then go to your domain provider and point your domain to the Elastic IP address.  You don't need to transfer your domain to AWS.  You can do this from the AWS management console.In this way, you can start a second instance and test any application updates, then just move the Elastic IP to the second instance without having to make any changes with your domain provider."

Java Development	"Re: How to transfer a domain name I own to Amazon (EC2)
As BrianW@AWS said, you don't transfer the domain name to AWS. They are not a domain registrar. What you want to do is modify the DNS records. If you haven't purchased a DNS service from a third party, then this is probably provided by your current domain registrar. You need to locate any web control panel they might have provided you with or ask them how to update DNS records.

Let's say you want to host your domain www.example.com at AWS. First you launch an EC2 instance, and configure it according to your requirements. In this example you might want to serve web pages for www.example.com, so you install a web server. You will also need a static IP address. AWS calls them Elastic IPs. Get one using the AWS management console and assign to your running instance. Done! You can now go back to your DNS service provider / domain registrar and (ask them to) add an A record for your Elastic IP. Then all requests for www.example.com will be sent to your instance.

There are other hosting options available as well. If you want to host a static website, you can take a look at S3 instead of EC2. Maybe you don't even want to host a website - I just assumed that's what you were looking for."

Hi Bruce,

Recently I saw the EC2 Pricing mentioned

"" 
Free Tier

As part of AWS’s Free Usage Tier, new AWS customers can get started with Amazon EC2 for free. Upon sign-up, new AWS customers receive the following EC2 services each month for one year:

750 hours of EC2 running Linux/Unix Micro instance usage
750 hours of Elastic Load Balancing plus 15 GB data processing
10 GB of Amazon Elastic Block Storage (EBS) plus 1 million IOs, 1 GB snapshot storage, 10,000 snapshot Get Requests and 1,000 snapshot Put Requests
15 GB of bandwidth in and 15 GB of bandwidth out aggregated across all AWS services

Hi Everyone,

I'd just like to let any interested parties know, that we've released a .NET library for interfacing with Route 53. It provides an object oriented way to interact with all aspects of the Route 53 API.

For non-commerical purposes, its freely available (and can be licensed for commercial use).

We've also released a companion application as an example of how the library can be used. This is a Windows desktop app, that allows for full management of Route 53 zones. The C# source code to this app is freely available to assist developers in getting start with our library.

The library can be found at R53Connect
The desktop app can be found at R53Desktop

Java Development	"Re: AWS Toolkit for Eclipse Don't Work
Hey diegoahgora,

My guess is that something happened when copying the DTP-1.7 plugins/ and features/ folders into your Eclipse install.

Since you're using Eclipse-3.5 Galileo, you don't need to do anything extra to get the right version of DTP.  (That's only necessary for Eclipse-3.4 Ganymede.)

Try re-downloading a fresh install of Eclipse-3.5 Galileo (JEE distribution) from the link you included, and then try installing the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse from http://aws.amazon.com/eclipse .

Hope that helps.  Let us know how it goes!

Yes, it worked. (Y)thanks"

I have installed Eclipse for Java EE Developers 3.6 and have jdk 1.6 as well. I am unable to install the AWS for Eclipse plugin via Help -> Install New Software menu in the eclipse IDE. It is repeatedly returning ""Read Timed Out"" error. 
I have downloaded the AWS plugin zip file from github - but not sure where I should extract it to as part of the eclipse folder. Am new to eclipse IDE. Can you please help? Thanks."
Java Development	"Re: AWS Toolkit for Eclipse Don't Work
Hey devdeals,

Try installing the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse from the Eclipse Marketplace client (""Help"" -> ""Eclipse Marketplace..."" -> then search for AWS).  That might be an easier way to get everything installed.

let us know if that helps,
j"
Java Development	"Re: AWS Toolkit for Eclipse Don't Work
Hi jason,
Thanks for the quick response.

Tried Eclipse Marketplace also. Am getting the same ""Read Timed Out"" error. Can I unzip the aws zip directory from github or sourceforge to install the plugin? If yes, which location in the eclipse program folder do I extract the zip file to?

I am on Windows XP SP3."
Java Development	"Re: AWS Toolkit for Eclipse Don't Work
Only the source is available through GitHub, you need the built plugins/features.  You should really use Eclipse's update manager, otherwise it's very easy to get your Eclipse install in a bad situation by installing plugins manually (ex: you won't get proper plugin dependency checking).

Are you able to view this URL:
http://aws.amazon.com/eclipse/site.xml 

Eclipse pulls that first, then pulls the individual plugin/feature zip files from Amazon CloudFront.

Try opening Eclipse's ""Error Log"" view and see if there are any stack traces or extra information available there.

Java Development	"Eclipse AWS Plugin & Tomcat Max Memory
All,First off, I'm new to AWS.I am playing around with EC2 and Tomcat WebApps, is there any way to increase the max heap size?  Generally you could do that via the launch configuration for your servet [Tomcat].  But for EC2 Tomcat, the launch configuration doesn't have that capability.So, is there any way to increase the heapsize (-Xmx) for the JVM that will run tomcat?Cheers."

In the launch config, it does sayfor additional configuration, open the server's editor under ""server"" view.More Info:I am using eclipse 3.5Under MacOSX.If I click on the EC2 cluster, I can do ""show in > debug or console"".  Nothing happens when I do that.If I click open, then it goes to the server overview page..."

Hey ericg22, 

you can't currently configure JVM level settings through the EC2 Tomcat WTP server.  It's a great feature request though."
Java Development	"Re: Eclipse AWS Plugin & Tomcat Max Memory
Hello,

I know this thread is a bit old, but I would like to revive it because I too am in a situation where I absolutely need to increase the max heap size of my Tomcat WebApp.

I understand that the Eclipse plugin does not allow for this configuration. Here are two possible alternative approaches:

1) Forget about the Eclipse plugin and do everything manually.
2) Create a modified AIM in which the max heap size is set via some environment variables.

Neither option is great, and I'm not sure whether 2) is even possible. So, to my question: does anybody have any suggestions as to how to best go about this?

Any pointers would be greatly appreciated; it is very frustrating that such a simple configuration is so cumbersome.

Thanks,
Michael."

Hey Michael,

just wanted to make sure you saw that we released AWS Elastic Beanstalk (http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk) last week, along with a big update to the Eclipse tools.

This is a big step up in performance and reliability for deploying Java web applications using the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse, and you'll have access to tweak much more configuration, such as JVM settings.

There's a quick screencast showing the new Eclipse functionality here:

Java Development	"Eclipse Tutorial - Unable to run project
Hi,I am new to the elastic cloud and am trying it out with a view to using it in forthcoming projects.  I started off going though the ""Getting Started with Amazon EC2 Management in Eclipse"" article (from the AWE Toolkit for Eclipse page).I created the application and it successfully runs from eclipse using a local Tomcat instance - no issues.  I then created the server exactly as in the tutorial (5 instances, no elastic ip, same security group (all zeros in each entry), ami-11ca2d78 etc).  The instances all start up and I am able to successfully secure shell into them.When I run the application on this Amazon cluster, I get a message in the Eclipse browser- ""503 Service Unavailable - No server is available to handle this request"".  I have tried several times yesterdayand today and still get this message.I also tried defining a single server (same AMI) in case it was the cluster going wrong.  When I do this I get a message ""Navigation to the webpage was cancelled"" - on refreshing the page as the browser suggests, I get a ""This program cannot display the webpage"".I spent much of yesterday and today playing with this and have been through some other tutorials, each of which defines a single serverand each time I get this set of messages.  There is no difference if I add an elastic IP either.  I have tried on US West and East coast with the same result.I am not sure if there is a step missing somewhere, but I am running the app fine locally and following the steps exactly.  My bill is rising and I have not had a single application.Can someone help me get this working please ?Thanks in advance !"
Java Development	"Re: Eclipse Tutorial - Unable to run project
Hey srisom,

I'm not sure exactly what's happening, but maybe some of these ideas will help turn up a clue...

if you're having problems, simplifying is definitely a good idea.  It sounds like you've already tried with just a single EC2 Tomcat instance without an Elastic IP.  I'd stick with that to start off while you get everything figured out.

Make sure that you're right clicking on the servlet you want to run (whether in the editor or from the package explorer view) and selecting ""run as..."" -> ""run on servier"" then your EC2 Tomcat server.  Clicking directly on the project and selecting ""run as..."" -> ""run on server"" probably won't work because there isn't a default resource defined.

There might also be something in your network configuration causing problems.  If you have to go through a proxy server to get to the internet, you might have some problems using the Eclipse tools since they need to ssh to the EC2 hosts and configure everything.

Another problem I've run into is that port 8080 is blocked by some firewalls, so I have to change my Tomcat configuration to launch on port 80 instead (default is 8080 of course), and make sure that port is also open to CIDR IP 0.0.0.0/0 in your security group like you mentioned.

If you can ssh into the EC2 box, then you might try using curl or wget to hit ""localhost:80"" and see if you can access the server from there.  If so, then it seems likely to be a security group or network firewall/proxy issue.

Finally, don't forget to check the ""Error Log"" view in Eclipse to see if there are any clues in there.

hope that helps,
j"
Java Development	"Re: Eclipse Tutorial - Unable to run project
Jason,Thank you so much for answering and giving some pointers.  I have been through the points and discovered that:1) Right clicking is ok.  I am doing that on the servlet - if I do this and choose my local Tomcat then it all works fine.2) Don't think I am going through a proxy - certainly the browsers have no entries and I have never had to put one in for anything - so this is unlikely.3) I logged on with ssh and from the server tried both curl and wget on localhost ports 80 and 8080.  Both tools failed ('couln't connect to host' from curl and 'Connection refused' from wget).4) I went into the Tomcat/conf directory on the server and swapped both references to 8080 in server.xml to 80, set JAVA_HOME to /env/jdk, ran the shutdown in the tomcat bin directory (this gave a connection refused error) and ran startup without error.  I hope this is correct to change the port.  After doing this I got the same messages from wget and curl.  I tried restarting the Tomcat server from the server view in Eclipse but it terminated the entire server and started a new one (so I lost my port 80 changes).My security group has all zeros set for ports 22,80,443 and 8080.  My local error log is completely empty.I am guessing that the issue is something to do with the connection failures etc on the server but am in the dark as to next steps.Can you offer any advice / suggestions ?Much appreciated !"

Java Development	"Re: Eclipse Tutorial - Unable to run project
I have got a bit further on this.  I discovered by logging into the AMI and checking the processes, that Tomcat is not started.  Trying to start it (setting environment and doing a catalina start) causes a java stack trace.At this point I gave up on this AMI.  I have successfully deployed my app using the Java Web Apps in a Box AMI.  You cannot deploy directly from eclipse but you can export to a WAR file and load into tomcat with no issues.  I am going down that road unless the standard AMI gets sorted.Google 'Java development 2.0:Easy EC2' and follow the IBM step through."
Java Development	"Re: Eclipse Tutorial - Unable to run project
Hey srisom,I just checked out the IBM DeveloperWorks article you mentioned.  it looks like a great walkthrough for Eclipse/EC2/Java/Tomcat.  I'm glad you were able to get that setup working.I'm not sure why Tomcat wouldn't be starting up for you.  I'll see if we can reproduce that over here.  If you or others on the thread see this again, you can launch Eclipse from a command line with the ""-debug -consoleLog"" options, you should get debugging output in your terminal window from the toolkit that provides some clues as to what's happening when something goes wrong when Eclipse is launching the EC2 instances, pushing the application and starting Tomcat.  The output is fairly verbose, so feel free to private message it to me and I'd be happy to take a look and see if we can find any clues."

A Solution!! (I think)

I had the exact same problem, everything working fine locally but could get nothing to run on AmazonEC2. I too noticed from the shell log for catalina.out that tomcat wasn't started.

A day and a half later...

I found the problem to be my server runtime environment in eclipse when you set up the server. It was set as Apache Tomcat V 6.0, of course, but I was using the latest version (6.0.24) and this seems to be the problem. I downloaded an older version from the Tomcat archive (6.0.18) and added this when configuring runtime environments. Setting up an instance with this server runtime environment works!

Hey Lemis,

We just released AWS Elastic Beanstalk last week (http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk), which provides a really easy and highly configurable way to run Java web apps on AWS and have them automatically scale with load.

As part of that release, we did a big upgrade to the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse to support AWS Elastic Beanstalk.  We're still using all the same WTP tools in Eclipse, so your workflow shouldn't change much, but there is a new server type you can use: ""AWS Elastic Beanstalk for Tomcat 6"".

I'd definitely encourage you to try the new system; you should see much faster and more reliable performance now that AWS Elastic Beanstalk does all the heavy lifting.

There's a quick screencast showing the new Eclipse functionality here:

Java Development	"Re: New S3 AWS Mgmt Console is loading and loading and loading...
Hi Carl,Why on earth would Amazon require access to a non-standard port for ANY console type of service?  Just use HTTP!  Any communication to the S3 service itself should be on your servers.Many, many companies that need to use this service have very strict and fixed firewall rules (e.g., mine).  Now I cannot use S3 at all at work, since it is nigh impossible to get the firewall access changed at this company.Surely this is a major design flaw that you plan to correct, right?  Right?"
Java Development	"Re: New S3 AWS Mgmt Console is loading and loading and loading...
Agreed - I'm working for a large corporate and have struggled to get approval for any work on the cloud at all - there is no hope of getting a non-standard firewall port opened!

We can work around this by using the command-line tools, but it's going to be a huge barrier to wider adoption of aws here.

The console was working fine with standard http proxy and firewall settings a few months ago when we evaluated Amazon as an option - why this regression?"

I am behind a very permissive firewall, (allows all outbound traffic,)  and I cannot get the s3 console to work either.  It just sits at the loading screen indefinitely.I even get redirected to the amazon test page, which reports everything is fine, but still no s3 console.this is on x86_64 ubuntu 10.04LTS, firefox 3.6.9, flash 10."

Hi Chris,

The S3 Console uses flash to talk to the S3 servers. This has been the case since the S3 console was first released. Given that the iPad doesn't have flash support, the S3 Console would have never been accessible from the iPad. 

As regards the folks having trouble loading the console, would you please provide the ID of the diagnostic report generated by the console test page, and we will investigate.

In order for a service to become active we must validate the credit card on file for the account.  You received a notification that the card was unable to be verified which indicates that the service is not active.

Once the credit card has been properly validated and the service is active you will have access to the management console.

Hello,

I would like give you some Feedback on the AWS Management Console.

Bugs:

Instances: After launching a new instance the final ""close"" button in the dialog does not work. Only the closing button in the upper right corner works. After that, sometimes the ""launch instance"" button does not work any more.
Security Groups: It is not possible to add a new custom rule with protocol, port and group. Only predefined ones or custom but without group or custom with group but without specific protocol and port. The html form fields are always cleared by JavaScript.
Security Groups: When you add rule to group A, the switch to group B and then back to A it says ""No records found.""
Sometimes the navigation ""AWS | Products | Developers ..."" in the upper right corner shifts down to the tab ""Amazon S3 | Amazon EC2 ..."".
Account, Personal Information: The form does not work with special characters, e.g. München (Munich).


My browser is Chrome 7.

Apart from this it would be great to add multiple security groups to one instance.

First EC2 page after login: Not everyone is an American and using the default region. So why is it displayed always the first time? Even for people just using e.g. eu-west-1. It would be much better to see the actually used EC2 region first.

Java Development	"Re: Feedback on the Manamement Console
Thanks for taking the time to give us feedback!  We will take a look and see what we can improve.

A couple things:

You can select any number of Security Groups in the Launch Instances Wizard (use cmd-click or alt-click on Security Groups).  

For custom Security Group rules, the Console only supports Group rules or protocol/port/cidr rules.
That is, if you specify another group in your rule, you are allowing instances in the target group full access to the instances in the allowing group.
Security Groups are a confusing topic, we hope to improve the UI for them in the future.

And finally, yes, the navigation (and other things) may compress in funny ways if the browser width is too narrow.

Java Development	"Re: workdocs storage
Hello chris125163,

My name is MD. I'm the GM for WorkDocs application.

Thanks for reaching out to us and sorry for the inconvenience this issue may have caused. As you may know WorkDocs supports unlimited versions of a file. Although each version of a file may only be a few gigabytes, you can quickly consume all your allocated storage if you create many versions of the file. Storage quota is controlled and applied by your site administrator/s.

You have two options:
1. Easiest: if you so wish, you could contact your administrator (WorkDocs web application: Tasks > New Task > Contact Administrator) and request an addition to your storage quota.

2. If you do not wish to keep all the previous versions of the file, please follow these steps:

Download the file to your local machine to a temporary location.
Delete it from the WorkDocs folders (this releases all storage associated with the file).
Upload the file (from your temporary location) back into WorkDocs.
Lastly, and this important: Lock the file in WorkDocs. This will ensure that while updates are made the file and uploaded to the cloud, new versions are not created for each update.


Hope this helps. Apologies for the inconvenience once again.

Thanks,
MD."

Many thanks for your reply.  I have managed to increase my quota.  However, I am now paying for 1.4TB of data when I am actually only using around 800GB.

I have only uploaded my files once through the drive app so there should not be any other versions of these files.  No other users have any other than view rights.  I suspect what is happening is if there is a glitch in the connection when uploading, the file might start to upload again.  I suspect these partial files are being stored as file versions.  Because I am sending up large video files, these old, imcomplete files are using a lot of storage.

As you say I can delete them from work docs and send them again but it is more than likely that this same situation will occur.  Yesterday I uploaded 4 files totalling 54GB but the total showing in Workdocs is 93GB.

Java Development	"Workdocs - security of sharing problem
Hi

I have setup WORKDOCS, and have a few users.
Each user has powerUser role, apart from myself, admin.

I've setup a shared folder from my drive, to be used for the company shared docs.

There is a hierarchy to the folders in this, and only parts are intended to be available to various levels/individuals.  
For example,
Company>HumanResources>Personnel>StaffOneName

In the folder StaffOneName, I have documents relating to that individual ""StaffOne"".
I gave contributor access to our HR manager at ""HumanResources"" folder level, so the HR manager can save and change documents. create new Personnel folders, and so on.
I gave the individual ""StaffOne"" view access on the folder containing his information, intending that this is all he could access.

In testing via Workdocs web access, I found that ""StaffOne"" can navigate to his folder ""StaffOneName"", but then clicking on the cookie trail links, he can navigate up a folder level to ""Personnel"", then see and navigate down into other staff folders, (eg ""StaffTwoName"" folder) and see other staff member details.

Considering that ""StaffOne"" has not been given any access to higher level or other folders in this hierarchy, nor inherited access to this, he should not be able to do this

This is a major security issue, or  I've missed something understanding how this is supposed to work?  
The documentation on sharing is accurate, but there's no security discussion in those docs, nor suggestion that what I have encountered is possible nor intended. Naturally, security being paramount, that this apparent 'reverse inheritance', should not be possible.

I would appreciate some direction/comment. As a newbie to WORKDOCS, happy for your 'guidance' to my possible misunderstanding or oversight of something.

Java Development	".rename folder holding large amount of data
I have an issue with the sync client not fully removing files.  I have several folders with video files in them that I moved to a folder that is not synced.  This should delete the files from the local drive and it appears to do that.  But it really moves the folders under a .renamed folder.  This is an issue because the files are quite large and need to be removed from the local system.

Is there a way to force a cleanup cleanup job to start or are the files under the .renamed folder removed after a specific period of time?"
Java Development	"Re: .rename folder holding large amount of data
Hi andrewlivingston:

Files would be moved under .rename folder for several reasons ( i.e. files with not allowed characters, trying to upload files to a folder where user doesn't have required permissions etc..)

Here is the suggested for your scenario,
1. Please make a copy of your files/media files on local machine.
2. Uninstall Sync client and remove all folders related to WorkDocs Sync client.
3. Ensure file names doesn't have any excluded items: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workdocs/latest/userguide/sync_client_help.html#sync_excluded_files 
4. Install WorkDocs Drive on your machine. Create a new folder where you want the files to be uploaded and copy from local device to this new folder.

Hello,
WorkDocs seems tailored around the use case provided by one client I'm working with. I'm now preparing a demo using the free trial version of WorkDocs but I realised that I can't find anything to customize the user interface. At least it would be good to add the client logo.

Java Development	"Re: Is there any customization option for WorkDocs user interface?
I can only assume that the ability to customize/brand the web client is an upcoming feature due to the language used ""As of now"".  Can someone please please elaborate on what will be possible and provide a timeline?

Personally, I would like to customize/brand the web client per user account. I'd prefer working from a simple XML/JSON file with the data and let me control the GUI. Should be simple enough and I already do that in a native Windows app (document management) my clients are currently using. I'm trying to move my clients away from Windows (Microsoft) and would prefer to use AWS ""if possible"". WorkDocs seems to be quite useful but lacks a lot of features my clients expect. 

A win-win solution would be to offer developers an API (as I noted in another post) that includes the ability to provide their own GUI. WorkDocs can still provide the backend security, management, storage, etc.

I am hopeful AWS (WorkDocs) will realize that some developers may be able to enhance WorkDocs way beyond their wildest dreams with a little help. Please enable us (developers) to do what we do best rather than tying our hands behind our backs.

Thank you in advance for your time and consideration."

Just to clarify, when I say they disappear I don't mean they blink and come back... although I have seen that happen (which was my first indicator it may be WorkDocs doing this to us).  In the three cases recently the icons and taskbar do not come back at all.  But as a follow up to that, I forgot to mention that on the one that happened while I was using the computer (opening WorkDocs), when I brought up the Task Manager there was no explorer.exe running on it.  So I just started a new explorer.exe and my icons and taskbar all came back.

4 and half years later, still not even a whimper. AWS' general apathy towards providing Linux support for many of its offerings is depressing.

There are competing products and companies out there that fully support Linux. So I guess we'll try our luck elsewhere."

Java Development	"Document Properties Search? Bespoke options?
Hi, I'm evaluating WorkDocs with a view to migrating a client from a different document management system. While what WorkDocs does, it seems to do very well, it is very weak on its searching capabilities. For example: 

document content search is not supported and 
the documentation is poor, so I don't even know if AND, OR searching is permitted.


If WorkDocs is to be taken seriously the searching needs to be improved. 

MS Office Document Properties Search?
But what is really killing this opportunity is the lack of document properties searching. My client extensively tags documents using MS Office properties, and their current solution allows filtering, sorting, and searching on these. Without at least a properties search capability WorkDocs is not a viable solution. 

I get that it doesn't do this out-of-the-box, but I've looked at the SDK, at ElasticSearch, ... and I can't even see how I'd bespoke this within AWS. Anyone got any ideas?

Hi,
I was using the old WorkDocs and it's location on disk was C:\Users\akiyano\WorkDocs.
If I wanted to access it via WSL I could go to /mnt/c/Users/akiyano/WorkDocs/.

Now there is the new WorkDocs Drive that adds a W:\ drive and now the WorkDocs path is W:\My Documents.

A few questions about this:
1. It seems that these are 2 separate locations on the disk and the WorkDocs client syncs between them. So does this mean WorkDocs now takes twice as much place? If so how do I avoid this?
2. I want to continue using WorkDocs in WSL but the only drive WSL sees is C:\ how do I access W:\?

Thanks,

Java Development	"Re: Location of new WorkDocs Drive on disk
G'day Arthur,

The new WorkDocs Drive client, which has replaced the older sync client, presents the 'W:' drive volume as a network mounted drive. On Windows 10 under the Windows Subsystem for Linux network drives will need to be explicitly mounted before they're available.

You should be able to execute the following commands from your WSL bash prompt when you have WorkDocs Drive mounted and running:
$ sudo mkdir /mnt/w
$ sudo mount -t drvfs W: w
$ cd /mnt/w
$ ls

Here's the copy/paste of my command line entries and output in WSL bash:
streetp@******:/mnt$ sudo mkdir /mnt/w
streetp@******:/mnt$ sudo mount -t drvfs W: /mnt/w
streetp@******:/mnt$ cd /mnt/w
streetp@******:/mnt/w$ ls

streetp@******:/mnt/w$ ls -la

Please see inline for my response:

1- Authorisation token with long-time expiry? This will enable us to authorise the user (company employees) only the first time for WorkDocs and every time they login in our app we don't need to ask for permission again.
MD: Longevity of tokens is imposed by the underlying Directory. That said, for all SimpleAD based Directories, tokens can live for ~30 days. We are going to be making an API available to our SDK customers to allow for refreshing the tokens behind the scenes. You will not have to prompt the user for logging in repeatedly with this API.

Java Development	"WorkDocs, lots of issues.  Am I using this wrong?
Hopefully this finds it's way to an Amazon employee on the WorkDocs team.

I think I may be attempting to use WorkDocs wrong.  Maybe you can shed some light on it's limitations, or how I could possibly improve performance...

We used to use Google Drive for sharing files at my company.  But it had a bit of a quirky behavior with creating multiple copies of the same file but I won't get into details there as this is about Amazon WorkDocs.  That behavior made me nervous and is why we switched (half a year ago?) to Amazon WorkDocs.  After having plenty of time using WorkDocs I now see some major downsides and I'm wondering if they're being worked on or if there is anything I can do about it here.

First, WorkDocs Sync starts eating up system resources (even though the Task Manager doesn't show it constantly it spikes occasionally -- but the system in the meantime is working at a crawl because of it).  It usually works fine for a little while, but if Sync is left running for a day or so (the timeframe may vary -- but it's not long), then this behavior begins.

This has happened in multiple versions of WorkDocs, and this happens all ALL systems we run WorkDocs on.  We have (4) Windows 10 systems, (2) Windows 7 systems, and (3) Amazon WorkSpaces that all have this behavior (the WorkSpaces are hit the hardest as those are pretty weak systems).  So I tell people to exit out of WorkDocs after they sync what they need or to just exit out WHEN their system begins behaving slowly.  This is not at all ideal.  Are you aware of this issue and is this something that will be fixed soon?  Early on I thought it was just my system, and then when I realized it was every system that used it I expected this would be fixed very soon as it's a rather critical problem... but it's still a problem.

Another very critical issue that we see, and again this behavior is across all of our computers, but the Sync client takes LONG periods of time just to sync a few changed files.  The sync time seems rather random.  It is never quick.  But sometimes it takes a few minutes, other times an hour goes by without a file syncing.  Add this to sometimes a user forgetting to re-starting WorkDocs sometimes (because of the first issue) and it just makes things even more frustrating.  Everybody expects this to work like Google Drive (or Dropbox) in that it will start syncing changed files nearly immediately.  But it has never done that.  Making tasks that require things to transfer between an Amazon WorkSpace and a local computer very tedious.  (I actually decided to post this message after somebody came to me and brought up that they might start e-mailing files they change to themselves to get between WorkSpaces and their local system because the Sync is making them entirely unproductive.)

I just wonder if we're not using WorkDocs as expected?  We do not use any of the commenting/collaborating features, we just use it to sync our documentation and development files between workstations.  Maybe others use it with just a handful of files?

Our WorkDocs folder that we sync is around 32,000 files, 4,000 folders, with a size of around 10GB.  So, not a whole lot, but maybe that's more than most use this for?  That's all I can think of, maybe somebody can shed some more light on this?

Finally, the third issue (or maybe ""behavior"" not issue in this case) is that I don't see a way to set a directory structure up so that it is identical on all of the systems we sync to.  This is because of the ""Shared With Me"" folder.  On my systems most of the folders are just in my WorkDocs folder directly as I'm the owner of them.  But on other people's computers all of these files are in the ""Shared With Me"" folder.  Which means any paths in batch files or configurations will not be correct on either my system or on everybody elses.  Is there a way to change this behavior so everything always go into the WorkDocs folder (or maybe a subfolder -- I don't care) but where it can be the same path on all systems (a way to bypass the ""Shared With Me"" folder)?

Again, this one is not as important, but it would make things much more simple if this was doable.

If you need any more information I'll gladly provide it.

This issue can occur in the following situations:
1. 
File Names and Lengths: WorkDocs supports Windows, Mac, iOS and Android platforms today. Unfortunately, all these platforms impose a variety of different restrictions on file names and lengths. WorkDocs, therefore, only allows names and lengths that are supported on all the platforms. If possible:
a) please rename the file 'Icon , Icon , Icon , Icon ...' to remove any special characters, like :/\ etc. 
b) shorten the name of the file.

2.
Intermittent networking issues: Sometimes, when uploading/downloading large number of files, any intermittent networking issue can result in failure to complete the operation. Please check and ensure that there are no disruptions in network connectivity during the uploads.

I will follow up with the team about improving the message to clearly indicate the failure and provide pointers to corrective actions.

Hello AmyL 

Thanks for using WorkDocs and for reporting the issue.

You are correct in that if your CTO is hosting a set of files and folders that are shared thru out your organization, the storage usage is computed against his quota. That said you can easily increase the storage limits on a per user basis by editing the user profile and setting storage to a desired limit. Any storage used over 1 TB is charged at local S3 rates.

Java Development	"WorkDocs Drive on WorkSpaces not working -- cannot get past login
So I recently switched all of our computers to start using WorkDocs Drive here which is a better setup than WorkDocs itself (cause we don't need local copies).  And WorkDocs was painfully slow at syncing up most of the time.  So since this is supposedly ""streaming"" I was hoping this would fix issue of not seeing files right away in different locations.

The scenario:  We have 3 users here at the office each with a computer here, we each also have a WorkSpace that we use, and a couple of us work on our home computers as well.  After initially installing WorkDocs Drive on everything, it all worked ok for a few days.  (Although the bug with WorkDocs Drive not staying logged in and having to login one or more times a day is a bit annoying -- but doable for now -- hopefully that gets fixed).

After a few days however, we could all still login to our WorkDocs Drive on all of the office computers and home computers, but none of the WorkSpaces let us login to WorkDocs Drive.  It behaves the same for all of us, and it is the same version across computers (1.0.1110.1).  What it does is after putting in the correct Username and Password then pressing Enter (or clicking ""Sign In""), the bottom part of the ""Sign In"" button greys (as it normally does on all computers right after clicking it), but on WorkSpaces it just remains at that screen with the bottom part of that button grey.  It does nothing more.  You can click on it all you want and nothing more will happen.  Repeated attempts at login, closing it down, re-opening, etc have no affect.  It never gets passed that sign in screen.

Again, this is 3 different WorkSpaces in use, with 3 different WorkDocs sign-ins as well.  All with the same problem.  And they all used to login, at least for a few days after first installing WorkDocs Drive.

Java Development	"WorkDocs Syncing Issues
Last summer we moved all files to WorkDocs.  Our office uses both Windows and Mac systems.  Although we have experienced syncing problems on both operating systems, the Macs seem to have the greatest difficulties.

My first question is simple . . . is there a way to force the sync client to sync?

At times the sync clients break and do not sync at all, but unfortunately most users are unaware the changes to their document have not been uploaded.  Multiply this issue among multiple users and this results in multiple versions of the same file stored locally on each computer with each user thinking other users have seen their edits.  This is a great problem that must be fixed.

When we realize a file does not sync, we always begin with a reboot of the computer.  At times when the entire sync app does not sync at all, a new test file is created and will at times kick start the syncing process, uploading the other changed files.  The test file however does not always work.

More recently, we are experiencing issues of individual files not syncing.  This is where the problems really compound as users can see from the sync history that files have been uploaded, so they assume all files have been uploaded.  This is not the case.

What is the best way to fix syncing problems?  What steps can be taken to verify a file has been synced.  Other cloud services provide some indicator when a file is in the process of syncing and then when it successfully or unsuccessfully completes.

Any help or advice is much appreciated.  Thank you!"

Hi JamesPinpoint:

Providing native access to Amazon WorkDocs files and folders in a reliable and consistent way is one of the key promise for Amazon WorkDocs. 
Over last year, we have made several improvements towards that,
1. For Windows users: We now offer WorkDocs Drive. It provides on-demand access to all files and folders natively in file explorer. It also provides visual badges for files and folders to exactly know when content is getting sync'd and when it is download. We are advising user's of WorkDocs to adopt WorkDocs Drive. More details on WorkDocs Drive can be found here - 
https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/04/amazon-workdocs-drive-is-now-available-for-microsoft-windows-use/ 

2. We have also made changes to Sync client to address the reliability issues including improvements in Selective Sync functionality. More details can be found here - 
https://preview.blog.amazonworkdocs.com/updates/2017/07/21/new-and-improved-sync-client-experience.html

Let me know if your users are running into any issue currently? We would like to investigate and address it. I will also look into the initial issue reported by TredAdmin on April 3rd, 2017 to ensure that resolution was provided.

Thanks

Hello chris916:

Thank you for providing the logs. We have confirmed that in your WorkDocs Recycle Bin, there are 100000 files. This is upper limit on allowed files in Recycle Bin. Due to that, when you are using WorkDocs Drive, any subsequent delete action is resulting in error.

To mitigate the issue:
You can review the content in WorkDocs Recycle Bin and empty the Recycle Bin ( OR selectively delete files ) if content is not needed. Note that deleted files will go to WorkDocs Admin's Recovery Bin. The Admin for WorkDocs can restore this content upto Retention policy period - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workdocs/latest/adminguide/admin_dashboard_retention.html

Java Development	"Re: Work docs Client Install
Hi Kevin:

It is certainly possible and that's one of the best practices that customers of WorkDocs follow.

For WorkDocs Drive - Admin can push the client install through SCCM and can specify the WorkDocs site-id as one of the parameters to MSI installer. This will make the client available to all the users pre-configured. Documentation is available here.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workdocs/latest/userguide/workdocs_drive_help.html#drive_install 

Additionally, for your enterprise, we would highly recommend to setup SSO with Active Directory of your organization. 

For Active Directory Integration to setup SSO, following are documented required setup:
Step 1: Enable SSO on the desired Directory ID as described in this article.- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/single_sign_on.html

Hi Kevin:

WorkDocs Drive provides on-demand access to user's cloud data natively on Windows devices, without taking up local disk space or adding latency to data access. WorkDocs Drive will replace Sync client.

Following MSI options with your WorkDocs site-id from SCCM will perform unattend install for 800 users without user requiring to answer any questions.

“msiexec /I “AWSWorkDocsDriveClient.msi” SITEID=<your-site-id> REBOOT=REALLYSUPPRESS /norestart”

Are there specific scenarios for your users, that requires use of WorkDocs Sync client ?
WorkDocs Drive provides functionality parity with Sync client and additional features, i.e. Search, Share, Marking content as favorite as well as ability to Pause sync if n/w bandwidth is limited.
If there are requirements for your organization that are not met by WorkDocs Drive, we would like to understand and provide the mitigations.

WorkDocs Sync client is ClickOnce based installer, so does not have support for SCCM based install. We are also planning to replace Sync client in lieu of WorkDocs Drive.

Hello Durgesh,

Thanks for tour reply !

Indeed, I used this document for the initial oauth setup : this allows the user to grant an application to perform operations using his account, in an interactive interface. At the end of it, I get an access token that works.
However, this token expires. OAuth provides means to refresh this token. This is non-interactive : as the user already gave his authorization, there is no need for him to fo through the ""allow application to perform actions on your behalf"" anymore.
I'm sure workdocs allows it because it's one of the core feature of oauth : once the user granted the rights, the application can perform tasks on his behalf in the background.

This is what I'm looking for, and this is not described in the article you pointed out. The only mention of ""refresh"" in that page is in the Java code snippet, but the override function is empty."

I have been using Google for a long time.   I have lots of data in Google Drive.  I just subscribe to both G Suite and Workmail.   I'm trying to learn the advanages and disadvantages of each platform.   

I'd like to make a big spreadsheet show the advantages and disadvantages of each platform.

I am planning to use workdocs sync client to collaborate among about 40 aws workspaces, with a load of about 300+ files a day.

The use case you have outlined is fully supported by WorkDocs and should work like you intend it to. WorkDocs is an elastic service and will automatically scale to meet your requirements, without interrupting your usage within service defined SLAs.

Sync client requires a user's credentials to log into WorkDocs site, and today it cannot be easily configured to  run as a service. You can have a locked user session however where sync runs in the background and keeps files in sync with the service.

Java Development	"WorkDocs Windows Sync - Asks for Re-Install Application
Hi

We are running into a big issue, and it has happened twice in last two months, which is driving us nuts.

We have a bunch of remote machines, say kiosks, with properly installed and working WorkDocs Sync client. We use the sync to display dashboard on our admin machine. The sync is just syncing few bytes small text files. 

This happened two months back also and I could reinstall sync again. At that time our kisok application was being tested inside our premises and it was handy to carry re-install task. This time, around 5 days back, again, my development and admin machine displayed WorkDocs re-install window with two buttons, viz., <Re-Install> and <Uninstall>, active button being <Uninstall>. I did not paid much attention but clicked on <Re-Install>. Interface window simply closed without further prompts and I could see sync working on my machine. The moment I opened the dashboard, I saw that none of the remote kiosk machine, in all 17, were syncing. This time the kiosk machines were in different locations in different cities and I had no clues how to fix this issue. I knew that on those machines, WorksDocs re-install window is open and waiting for a click on one of those two buttons, which btw cannot be carried-out as this re-install dialog is hiddent behind our kiosk application interface, unless I send a tech to each location to carry this task. 

Unfortunately I did not took a snap of re-install dialog. I am trying to capture one by sending a tech to the nearest location, and will post it here once I do. The frightening part is that I have lost control over the remote machines at all.

I cannot understand, however, is why a reinstall is popped up once the sync is installed with valid credentials. In my opinion, it must never. Otherwise effective usage of this tool is very limiting. If I do not get satisfactory response from Amazon, I have to abandon it all-together. Just in case it helps, I am been using SugarSync since years without such issue, albeit for some other project.

Java Development	"Issues Authenticating to WorkDocs Admin APIs using IAM credentials
I have been struggling with using the JavaScript API to performing other than a small subset of administrative functions. For example, using IAM credentials I am able to call the DescribeUsers API however my next step, to use the API for GetDocument fails with a permissions error.

My expectation of the fact this should work is based on two articles I had read regarding the WorkDocs APIs:

In the last paragraph on http://docs.aws.amazon.com/workdocs/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html the following is stated:

	All Amazon WorkDocs API actions are Amazon authenticated and certificate-signed. Use of the AWS SDK, but also allow for the exclusive use of IAM users and roles to help facilitate access, trust, and permission policies. By creating a role and allowing an IAM user to access the Amazon WorkDocs site, the IAM user gains full administrative visibility into the entire Amazon WorkDocs site (or as set in the IAM policy). This includes, but is not limited to, the ability to modify file permissions and upload any file to any user. This allows developers to perform the three use cases above, as well as give users the ability to grant access on a selective basis using the IAM model.

Further, on http://docs.aws.amazon.com/workdocs/latest/APIReference/API_GetDocument.html for the GetDocument API Reference, the description of the params include:

	AuthenticationToken
	Amazon WorkDocs authentication token. Do not set this field when using administrative API actions, as in accessing the API using AWS credentials.

Any insight would be greatly appreciated!

Java Development	"Re: Issues Authenticating to WorkDocs Admin APIs using IAM credentials
Hello, I am from WorkDocs team and I am more than happy to assist you.

Because you are using IAM credentials (I am assuming you are initializing the client with access key ID and secret access key), you should not set AuthenticationToken in any of API calls.

Please make sure:

You are setting correct region in the client. The region must be where your WorkDocs site resides. If your client is able to call DescribeUsers on same WorkDocs instance, this implies your region is correct.
You are passing correct document ID. Document ID will be the one shown in browser's address bar while browsing a document.
Your IAM policy allows calling GetDocument API of WorkDocs service.

Hi Syd,

It appears as though you're encountering issues with configuration of ClickOnce Trust Prompt Behavior.

We have recently rolled out a new update (Windows v1.2.622.1) that replaces an expired authenticode code signing certificate we use to sign our WorkDocs Sync Client for Windows Installer and associated application binaries. This change looks to have triggered ClickOnce Trust Prompt Behavior on some customer Windows machines.

It is possible that this ClickOnce Trust Prompt Behavior configuration may have changed with an update to group policy if on a managed host, or the result of some other security related update/change.

This has been reported by some customers in the past and has been successfully remedied by making changes as detailed in the following documentation from Microsoft's MSDN site you can read here:

How to: Configure the ClickOnce Trust Prompt Behavior - https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee308453.aspx

You will need to enable the ClickOnce Trust Prompt for Internet zone by having the value 'Enabled' or 'AuthenticodeRequired' set in order to have WorkDocs Sync Client for Windows be able to install/update.

Java Development	"Re: Can workdocs be utilized for large external file transfers?
Hello 
Answers to your specific questions: 
1) Can workdocs be utilized for large external file transfers?
Yes WorkDocs can be used to share large files with external users, using Share a link Facility 

2) These file transfers must be secure and must be available for up to one year from the original posting.
We use SSL in the Web UI and Sync client for secure over the wire transfer; lifespan of the file is upto the user, meaning user can delete files when they wish 

3) I am wanting to be able to email an attorney some links that he can click on view and also download to their computer. I can load the web page when I send an external share link, but I am unable to download a .mov file, I have checked the naming convention but the download button doesn't do anything.
If you click on download a copy the MOV file should download unless you have explicitly disabled download for the file.

Hi all,

I'm totally lost. I thought it worked, but at the end I can only send individual mails from Apple Mail 12.x via Amazon SES to some users. When I decide to pack a bunch of 100 email addresses and send them from Apple Mail to SES, I doesn't send them.

Where or whit what should I start.
In Apple Mail I made a SMTP mail server with all the settings I think. I need (Preferences - Accounts - Server Settings - Outgoing Mail account (dropdown) - Edit SMTP Server list.

For the Amazon server I filled in the following (see attachment). I'm not even 100% sure if this is all correct. I've connected the Amazon SMTP to my iCould account, but could use the Gmail too, I assume. Anyway, with this Amazon SMTP setting, it seems it's sending out my email. When I'm lucky, I can see that one more send or pass thru email is counted at my account. When the billing has detected another email, then I may assume that it works, but when I want to send a bunch of emails, lets say 100, it doesn't work with Apple Mail. The moment the email is send, I get straightaway a popup window telling me that I need to select either the Amazon SMTP server or another. No idea why this happens.

I hoep the story makes a bit sense that I can't solve this problem and thus I can't use Apple Mail with iCloud account and use Amazon SMTP for sending many emails. Oh yeah, I can send 50.000 emails per 24 hours, so that's set already to a high value. And all the email address I can use, all are verified for Amazon SES.

Do I do something wrong, do I miss a settings, have I forgotten something.

Anybody any idea of what information is more needed to help me out with this since I've got no idea anymore.

Java Development	"credit card for free tier sucks
Hi guys, signing up for the free tier shold not ask for a credit card. That totally sucks. I think about getting a prepaid credit card to avoid damages... 

Imagine, I an quite new into AWS, but aldready did some stuff at my workplace, got one EC2 instance hacked... for god's sake the hacker wasn't able to go further but he did try to crack other instances there for 3 days. Now image I do some more worse mistake with a free account with linked credit card. E.g. someone cracks my account, fires up 10.000 EC2 instances with 64 cores and mining some bitcoin... my bill would have 5 figures or even more and I am just an average paid IT employee where the boss said ""we now go for AWS"". 

That credit card thing is an absolute no-go. It reverses the responsability. 

instead do that like Microsoft Azure, they just stop everything when funding ends. The  Azure  evaluation signup gets you a one time credit of 150$, my MSDN gets me monthly 150$ but how about AWS? I am not qualified for the student or researcher program but I wanna acquire some AWS knowledge during a  long home stay...

Java Development	"Can AWS open a GitHub issues page to complement this (clunky) forum?
It seems like these forums are fairly well attended to by AWS staff, which is a really good thing. I've found that AWS is remarkably responsive across the array of communication channels. 

However, this forum is so much clunkier than using a Github issues section and I think the quality of AWS products suffers for it. There are a lot of AWS services (like Batch or Cloud9) that have been around for a long time but still lack shockingly basic features or have horrible UX/UIs and these forums seem to be the only way to provide feedback on those services -- but these forums are not a good way to provide feedback, imo.

I had an issue with the AWS Batch service and I stumbled across an old thread with an old issue that still has not been fixed. It's completely understandable that issues might take a year or two to fix, but these forums don't provide the same type of insight that a Github Issues section does -- seeing that old thread feels like a dead end. (https://forums.aws.amazon.com/message.jspa?messageID=800954)

On Github, I could:
 - upvote the thread & individual posts
 - see how many other people have engaged with it (more than just page views)
 - gauge whether the issue is on the aws team's radar
 - reference the issue in another issue or find related issues/solutions
 - see if anybody is working on that issue
 - see if the issue has been resolved
 - see a rich discussion by aws staff and developers
 - be sure that it is not a duplicate issue
 - see how many other issues are in the backlog to gauge likelihood of a fix
The AWS team would also benefit from the rich feedback interface that Github provides.

Some teams in AWS do have their own github issues section (eg. the aws-sdk javascript team -- where there are 135 open issues + 1700 closed issues and issues are posted every day and responded to almost immediately). The aws-sdk team is fantastic to work with and I'm sure that the tight user feedback loop is responsible for the quality of aws-sdk.

Please consider opening a Github issues page (an empty repo) for each individual AWS service so that users/developers can provide general feedback in a rich issue-tracking environment.

Java Development	"AWS - Chime New Version - Missed Features
Hello:

I wanted to leave some feedback on the recent upgrade to Chime.  The newer version looks great, but there are two features that were changed that I would like to let you know that I a missing them since the change.

1) No Taskbar notification when user joins your meeting.  

On MAC I used to get an alert badge when someone joined my meeting, letting me know that the other party is on the bridge.  It no longer shows that notification, so its hard to tell if people have joined your call or not.  This was great for meetings with a few people where people might be 5-10 minutes late. I dont have to sit on the bridge and I got some form of an alert when people did join.  I'd love a notification that someone has joined my meeting when I have chime open, but have not joined the meeting yet.  A lot of times, we get caught up, and it would be nice to have the option for a popup, ""Hey you are hosting a meeting and someone just joined and you are not there""

2) There is no longer a ""quick"" way to copy JUST your meeting link.  

While the update has a place to copy ALL the meeting info, most of the time (80%), I just want to copy the link quickly to post to people on chat or email and I want JUST the link, not the paragraph of other text that goes with it.  This feature was in the old version, but missing in the new.  The one click copy link was great."

I have a master account for billing and a couple of linked accounts for dev and test. I created an Owner tag on one of the EC2 instances in the master and one in the linked dev account (which is the one I am interested in), then activated it as per the docs.

I waited a couple of days and the Owner tag did then appear in the Cost Explorer of the master account for the tag I created on the master EC2 instance. It did not appear in the dev linked account Cost Explorer nor did the linked dev EC2 instance Owner tag appear in the master Cost Explorer.

Java Development	"Re: Cannot See Cost Explorer Tags In Linked Account
Hi Dan, 

I'm sorry for any trouble caused by the tags not showing in the Cost Explorer. 

There are a few potential reasons this could occur. The Billing & Cost Management console will only display Cost Allocation Tags you create for your resources after you've enabled Detailed Billing Reports on your console. To enable these reports, navigate to the link below and check the box labeled ""Receive Billing Reports"":

https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home?/preferences#/preferences

Once you've enabled these reports, you'll need to manually activate the tags you want to track at this link:

https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home?#/preferences/tags

This link only appears once you've enabled Detailed Billing Reports on your console, so often the link will not be visible if those reports aren't enabled.

If you wanted to save some time and do the research on your own, I'd recommend checking out the following resources on best practices for applying tags:

Hello, 

At this time you are correct, your Amazon.com and AWS Account can not be separated. We realize this is a pain-point and have sent the feedback to our development teams. 

In the future, a workaround you could use when setting up services is to create two separate accounts with different email addresses. 

Alternatively, to use the same email address you could add +aws to the email address. For example:

kitb@domain.com would be my Amazon.com account. 
kitb+aws@domain.com would be my AWS account. 

Any characters starting with the + and after are a sort of ""ghost"" and emails for my AWS account would still be directed to my regular email address. My login for AWS would require the +aws and it's individual password. 

If you're an existing customer, and are trying to do this, you would need to migrate the resources manually.

Hi guys. Today I received this mail from support. Good news: Accounts starting from August 10, 2017 are not more affected by the auto connection. Bad news: Old Accounts are not migrated and it doesn´t look like any solution will come in the future. So for me I will start migrating manually.

Hello,

Thanks for reaching out to us about the recently announced changes to our AWS sign in experience.

Starting August 10, 2017, newly created AWS accounts will no longer be connected to the Amazon.com retail account system. These accounts will have AWS-specific login credentials that are independent from the retail Amazon.com system.

This new account registration system does not have any effect on the way customers access their account or navigate the AWS console; this is simply an administrative change in the way our system manages AWS accounts. For more information on this new system, see our Security blog here:

https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/coming-soon-improvements-to-how-you-sign-in-to-your-aws-account/

At this time, existing AWS accounts created before July 31 will not be migrated to this new system. Additionally, we do not have any option to manually migrate existing accounts to this system upon request. I'm sorry for any concern this may cause.

I hope this helps.

Best regards,"
Java Development	"Re: Need to Separate AWS from Amazon.com consumer account
Oh dear. I didn't need any more reason to want to move away from Amazon. As an existing customer annoyed with this problem, the ""solution"" doesn't help me and has no provisions to attempt to help me. 
It looks a lot like Amazon made a decision to only help potential new customers, and has only regard for the revenue from existing customers and no regard for their interests. 
I'm at a point where I'm going to significantly scale up my infrastructure, and it has nothing to do with my personal Amazon.com account. I'll likely keep a small infrastructure on AWS for personal playing, and address my expanding needs on a not-so-unscrupulous platform."
Java Development	"Re: Need to Separate AWS from Amazon.com consumer account
I found the following solution to this problem:

Create a new user in IAM and do the following:

• Give the new user admin permissions by attaching the ""AdministratorAccess"" and ""Billing"" policies.

• Set the user's security credentials such it can gain access to the account via a login password.

• Make note of the ""Console login link"" provided in the security credentials tab. That is the link to be used by the new admin user to login.

• Be sure to record the ""secret access key"" to a safe place since I don't think you get another opportunity to do so.

Now go to your AWS account settings and make the following changes:

• Scroll to section ""IAM User and Role Access to Billing Information"" and activate IAM access.

• Scroll to ""Communication Preferences"", click through, click ""Profile"", and then enter an appropriate email address that differs from your normal Amazon email address.

That's it. The new admin user's login credentials now provide full control over AWS, including billing, but without access to your personal Amazon account (order history, etc) or use of your original email address.

Note that this is not a perfect solution because I believe your personal Amazon account must continue to maintain control of your AWS resources. That is not a good situation from the perspective of a new owner of your AWS resources. However, the solution does make it easy to transfer AWS control to a new owner, and the new owner can then migrate your AWS resources to their own account on their own schedule.

I hope that helps."

Java Development	"Re: Need to Separate AWS from Amazon.com consumer account
I am living this hell right now.  An employee who left the company has root, but has over a decade of purchase history and digital content from amazon.com that makes just ""handing it over"" not an option. Hindsight of course, but you have to understand, especially with small companies, AWS usually goes from experimentation from a single developer, to one service, to a giant and complex architecture. It's common for developers to signup with an email that is attached to an amazon.com account. I'm lucky that the relationship is not hostile, and I still have an IAM account. 

If you're running a blog on a single ec2 machine this migration is annoying, but not difficult. Start throwing in r53, s3, cf, lambda, transcoder, alb with many targets, all acm certs, dns, launch templates, rds, elasticache, mobile hub with analytics, cognito identity pools,  IAM accounts and roles.... goooooooooooooood luck. 

With cloudformation, ansible, etc you may think it would be easy to fire up everything in a new account, which is true, but it's really not that easy when you're migrating a ""in the wild"" production environment and can't afford downtime.

Hi

My initial issue was that I needed to train my deep learning network with Sagemaker and required instance limits to the P2 instances. However, I have asked for the wrong instance limits increase.

Hi Darryll,

I created a case, however a week pass and I still don't get any response. I bought a RDS RI, just 2 days I was charged for over 400 hours of usage (how is it possible?).
I started my trial last year, so my setting is using the previous generation; there is something I don't understand, t1.micro is more expensive than t2.micro. After looking at my cost, I know that I have to stop using the previous generation (more expensive and worst), so I decided to buy EC2 RI and RDS RI to lower my cost. After I bought my RDS RI, when I tried to buy EC2 no-upfront RI I got error so I created a case and it took about 5 days and the response I received is totally not related to my error https://forums.aws.amazon.com/message.jspa?messageID=602067#602067.

Hi

I had a very similar experience!
I setup a Amazon web service account at early May, 2015, wanting to try things out.
The warnings for when things are NOT free are so discrete!
Somehow I started a large RDS instance that was not free, but I never put much data in it. 
By today, May 21, I have been billed more than $580. 
I don't believe that's fair! There should have been LOUD warnings! Or it should be an option not to add your credit card and then simply not open paid services!
The instance has hardly been accessed and the data was only put there once. 
On top of this, how can this once RDS cost more than $580 for 16 days?
I'm requesting for the refund of the bill. 

I have cancelled my account and as such closed down all my instances.

But trainer DID NOT notify all the students that all the resources created during the training must be stopped or deleted to avoid extra charges. It is very bad.
2) After registering in AWS I start getting many junk ad emails from amazon. But for some reason there is no notification that AWS resource usage reached free tier limits and AWS started to charge me. This notification must be sent!!!

Java Development	"Account Compromised - A Review of my Customer Journey
As a professional who takes a keen interest and works with clients as it relates to customer journeys, I thought I would detail my own as it related to my own security mistake and where it has taken me in the last 8 hours so far. 

My journey started over the last few weeks as I have been trying to create scripts to launch and subsequently configure EC2 instances for the purposes of installing and readying our company's software for initial use. This has meant that I have been making use of multiple AWS services: S3, EC2, EBS to name a few. I had created an Administrative Access Key to help in this process.

Initial Compromise and Re-securing Directions
Today, I was continuing to work on the same script and thought it might be a good idea to start putting these under some version control so I went to GitHub and like a fool, forgot to take my AWS key out of the file - big mistake.

Approximately, 30 mins later as I was still working in my AWS instance, I received two emails 6 mins apart notifying that something was very wrong in my account:

Subject: Action Required: Your AWS account 3403xxxxxxxx is compromised
Subject: Account Closure: Please Read

I had made the commit into Github ~ 30 mins prior to receiving these emails - the first email was received right at the moment  approximately 44 VERY large EC2 instances were spun up in my name. Both these emails put the fear of God into me. The emails themselves did a good job of directing me exactly what to do. In a few short mins, I removed the users, groups, roles that what I only can suspect was an automated script that continuously monitors GitHub for suckers like me. To Amazon's credit, my account was locked down within 6 mins of compromise. 

Initial Compromise and Re-securing Directions Grade: A+

Post Re-Securing Cleanup Journey
After re-securing my account, I needed to begin the process of finding what this exploit script left behind. This is where the customer journey takes a turn. I was informed that I should check all Amazon services to do so paying particular attention to EBS, S3, EC2, groups, roles, and users. Unlike a credit card company, there is no transaction history to return to see and find what might have been opened. In cases like this, it would be incredibly helpful to know what services were requisitioned and when as I can point out around the exact time the exploit script hit. Instead, I have hit most of the major services and I BELIEVE that at most this exploit script was interested in spinning up instances of EC2. That said, I'm not sure if you have gone through the Amazon catalog as of late, but there are literally hundreds of services across all the different regions and any of those could have been turned on and I likely won't know it until it hits my bill - in that case it will be a few hours behind, which isn't good for Amazon or me.

Additions that Would be Helpful in this Situation

A single list of services that are currently being used across each region
Even if I just had a quick dashboard that all services, across all regions where I could quickly see what was turned on and being used that would be super helpful to know where stuff was running.

A transaction list of items that had been turned on / used in the last day 
With this I could pinpoint the exact services that were currently on. Yes, I know this will come in my billing, but it would be nice if we didn't have to worry about it after it got billed.

Post Re-Securing Cleanup Journey Grade: C

Account Recovery and Getting Back to Normal

With all the fireworks and work that was done to get through the first 10 minutes of account compromise, this portion is the most disappointing and most opaque. Currently, I believe I have my account secured and ready to start work again, but I have no idea. The initial case that was setup said to respond, but the case file says it is still unassigned. In addition, my ability to requisition EC2 and EC2 spot instances are blocked effectively stopping any of my work at the moment. I understand the desire to have a human in the loop, but it would be helpful if there was an automated way that AWS could verify everything is in good working order. Even better, if I just had a complete ""account reset"" button that rolled back as if my account was brand new with being compromised, I would have gladly taken that route as I'm not really running anything myself at the moment that couldn't be rebuilt. Right now I'm dead in the water until I can get back to creating EC2 instances and I have no way of knowing if I have done everything I'm supposed to do (there is no checklist nor is there any timeline that has been shared).

Additions that Would be Helpful in this Situation






A reset all button for my account to take it back to brand new (only available if account appears to be compromised
A programmatic checklist that could scan changes made to an account in order to see if it meets expectations for recovery
A timeline or sense of timing of when account use can return to normal






Account Recovery and Getting Back to Normal Grade: D-

Java Development	"AlSPL accounts do not auto-deduct from Credit Cards
Hi,
I was notified today that AISPL (AWS-India) accounts do not automatically deduct the montly charges from the cards listed under Payment methods and that this is supposedly a privilege given to Indian users. 

I am sorry, but I do not want this so called privilege, and would like to have an option where either:
1. Money is automatically deducted from my account (like every other 21st century service does).
2. I can load up money as credits in some sort of a AWS wallet from which auto-deductions can be done.

Come on guys, you are seriously wasting my time by making me go through the payment process every single month. If you don't respect my time then don't be surprised when I switch to a different cloud provider and also recommend businesses that consult me to switch along-with.

Java Development	"Re: AlSPL accounts do not auto-deduct from Credit Cards
Hi again, 

I just wanted to let you know that your feedback was brought to our Payments team & they wanted to let you know auto-charge for credit cards is now available. The next time you make a payment you'll be enrolled in auto-charge. You can also enroll through the Payment Methods page in the Billing Console: 

https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home?#/paymentmethods

Note that we can auto-charge for invoices less than 10,000 INR. Regulations in India prevent us from charging credit cards for large invoice payments. For invoices > 10,000 INR, you will need to approve payments by completing two factor authentication.

Hi Jakob,

I just had the same problem and I found a solution.

1st, it seems the link just links to the case history in general, so you're not able to see the ticket of the OP but your own.
2nd, you need to enable cost tags to be able to use them.
activate cost allocation tags:
To activate your tags
   Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Billing and Cost Management console at >https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/.
   In the navigation pane, choose Cost Allocation Tags.
   Select the tag(s) that you want to activate.
   Choose Save.
Source: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/activating-tags.html

After you've enabled cost tags, you can choose which ones you want to activate. It took a while for me, the tags where available in cost explorer the next day."

Hi famama,

I checked your account details and I wasn't able to find any active tags in use. I also found that need to have your preferences updated for tags to be actively used on your account. This would be the most likely reason you're not able to view the tags in your Cost Explorer.

Java Development	"China resources
Hi.

We have plans to run our application in China region and would like to have some information about possible issues there.

From what I already got - we can't have simple VPN from our EU to CH region. Is it correct?

Our infrastructure includes;

a) Maven to build Java code and Docker images;
b) Docker images to be saved in private registry (CBCcom? As Docker Hub will be too slow);
c) Packer to build AMIs adding Docker images inside;
d) Terraform to update ELB stack with new instances from Packer's AMIs.

As we seem will have EU <=> CN connection issues - currently, we plan to move Jenkins CI to CN instance.

But there are other issues as well:

1. `apt-get install maven` took about 2-3 hours to download all dependencies;
2. `mvn build` hangs on downloading Maven/Java dependencies;
3. an `ssh` connection to EC2 in CN too slow - can't even type commands (I'm writing them in a text editor, and then copy-paste to the terminal).

That's only a few I found at this moment (working from Kiev, not in CH yet).

Maybe somebody had a similar task and have some solution there?

Thanks in advance.

Hi,

We'd be happy to help as these are common challenges - downloading from foreign mirrors (wait until you try NPM) is a challenge - on your other issues:

1. `apt-get install maven` took about 2-3 hours to download all dependencies;

Yes - careful mirror selection is critical here; there are some choices.

2. `mvn build` hangs on downloading Maven/Java dependencies;

Best to mirror  - we also do local caching on Jenkins some times for this.

3. an `ssh` connection to EC2 in CN too slow - can't even type commands (I'm writing them in a text editor, and then copy-paste to the terminal).

This is usually a routing issue - try going indirectly to Korea or Japan or if in Europe, Singapore first then to Bejing - can make a huge difference.

I m using several cloud provider to operate my application and need to retrieve information from all my providers. To do that I use their “status page” like :

Java Development	"Re: AWS Status page improvement (JSON and CORS support)
Here is the answer from the AWS engineer contacted through my company :

The JSON version of the AWS Status data that you found is actually an undocumented, internal API that the web page uses.
The official and supported programmatic way of getting AWS status information is to use the various RSS feeds that you see on the page to the right of the table entries.
As you can see, the RSS feed URLs follow a simple naming convention, so you don't need to copy paste them into a large table, instead, you can use any of the popular RSS feed parsers and a few for loops to cycle through all the regions and services that interest you and retrieve their status information.

I hope it can help some people."

The AMI contains Windows Server Core Install : https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh846323(v=vs.85).aspx, so seeing only Command Prompt is expected.

By default the network services are disabled on SQL Server. Need to restart network services to be able to reach SQL Server (port 1443) from outside server.

Following is the way to enable the networking service:
1. Use netstat -a -b to verify port 1433 is not LISTENING
2. Run C:\Windows\SysWOW64\SQLServerManager12.msc from cmd.exe to open SQL Server 2014 Configuration Manager
3. Follow Steps in Microsoft Article   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/enable-or-disable-a-server-network-protocol?view=sql-server-2017  to check the network status, enable, and restart SQL Server
4. After SQL Server restart, check for port status using netstat -a -b
5. Should be able to connect from other servers after that, off course assuming the port is allowed.

Hello,

I have a very strange problem.

I have an application with nodejs (talking to AWS) and Angularjs.

Java Development	"key pair in eclipse toolkit
Hi,I've setup the eclipse toolkit and it is listing my instance but the key pair has a big red 'x' next to its name.  I can also not connect to the instance via the eclipse toolkit. Everything works well in the aws console or elasticfox.  I have the keys in ~/.ec2/ in which they should be detected automatically. What am I missing?  How can I fix this?- Markus"
Java Development	"Re: key pair in eclipse toolkit
Hey Markus,

that red 'x' definitely means the toolkit can't find your private key, just like you mentioned.  

There's two ways to take care of this:
 1 - ensure that the corresponding private keys live in ~/.ec2/ and that the file name is in the form ""<key-name>.pem"" .   It sounds like you've already got your keys in the right directory, so I'm guessing maybe they just have a different file extension?  Some private keys on windows/mac tend to use different extensions depending on which platform they're created for, so maybe the toolkit needs to be aware of that and accept other extensions, too.  If that's what's happening to you, i'll open a bug report so we can add that feature.

 2 - If you can get to EC2 Key Pair widget (in the Launch Wizard for example), you can right click on the key pair and click the ""Select private key file"" menu item to explicitly map a private key to a key pair.  I've got a change open to make it easier to get to that Key Pair widget from the preferences, but until that's submitted and built, you can find it on the Launch Wizard.

Let us know if that helps and if you have any other feedback,
j"

Yes, it is a very broad question, but I would say that you can expect to find nearly everything around server management in the ""raw"" APIs.

We've done extensive testing with other AWS accounts that we use and there doesn't seem to be any problem.  Its just one of the accounts we use.  From different geographic locations, and various ports, we are unable to connect after allowing access using the AWS management console.  We also tested ElasticFox and the java CLI api, and we have the same result.  

Furthermore, when we delete existing rules, the access remains, for example we blocked the ping/icmp ports and are still able to ping from hosts that should not have access.
