Hi all,

I need to activate Performance Insight for a database, but this section is not shown for the database. It's a Oracle Standard Edition Twi db.t2.micro instance. As I found in docs all oracle should be supported. Any suggetions how to enable this feature or did I miss something?

The Performance Schema parameters needed for Performance Insights are documented here:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PerfInsights.Enabling.html#USER_PerfInsights.EnableMySQL

The easiest way to manage Performance Schema for Performance Insights is to leave the Performance Schema parameters to their default which is off and then Performance Insights will automatically manage them. If Performance Schema is already on, then Performance Insights won't managed the Performance Schema parameters.  Whether managed automatically by Performance Insights or managed manually, shouldn't mater to Performance Insights if the right parameters are set. When the right parameters are set Performance Insights shows database load by wait events by default. When the parameters are not set Performance Insights shows database load by SQL by default and if load by  waits is chosen it will show load by ""states""  instead of ""waits"" (most waits have slashes in their name like ""wait/io/file"") . Showing load by waits is much more useful than load by state.  We have found situations where the message warning about the parameters not being set has been incorrect and that is being addressing quickly.

Performance Insights is divided into two sections. The top section shows the load of the database over time. By default that load is grouped by wait events and you can see among the waits, the CPU time demanded by the sessions on the database. This CPU should be the same or smaller than the CPU from Cloudwatch (as Cloudwatch CPU can include processes running outside the database). CPU will be reported in units of Average Active Sessions (AAS) which is different that % CPU. AAS can be converted to %CPU by dividing AAS for CPU by ""Max CPU"" which is the number of vCPU. If my AAS for CPU is 1 and my ""Max CPU"" is 4 (i.e. I have 4 vCPU) then my %CPU is 25%. Visually this is easy to see by seeing that AAS from CPU is about 1/4 of the height of the Max CPU line. 

On the other hand the bottom section of Performance Insights show by default the Top SQL. The bar in top SQL shows the relative load of each SQL. The load bar by default is grouped in to colors which represent the relative time spent on each type of wait. The wait colors correspond to the wait colors in the load chart on top. If the bar looks like it's full, it doesn't mean it's at 100% - it's just showing the relative load of the SQL vs the other SQL.  If that SQL's load bar is all CPU, it's spending 100% of it's time on CPU but it doesn't mean it's using 100% CPU on the host. The % CPU usage on the host can be seen in the Load chart.

Performance Insights is divided into two sections. The top section shows the load of the database over time. By default that load is grouped by wait events and you can see among the waits, the CPU time demanded by the sessions on the database. This CPU should be the same or smaller than the CPU from Cloudwatch (as Cloudwatch CPU can include processes running outside the database). CPU will be reported in units of Average Active Sessions (AAS) which is different that % CPU. AAS can be converted to %CPU by dividing AAS for CPU by ""Max CPU"" which is the number of vCPU. If my AAS for CPU is 1 and my ""Max CPU"" is 4 (i.e. I have 4 vCPU) then my %CPU is 25%. Visually this is easy to see by seeing that AAS from CPU is about 1/4 of the height of the Max CPU line.

On the other hand the bottom section of Performance Insights show by default the Top SQL. The bar in top SQL shows the relative load of each SQL. The load bar by default is grouped in to colors which represent the relative time spent on each type of wait. The wait colors correspond to the wait colors in the load chart on top. If the bar looks like it's full, it doesn't mean it's at 100% - it's just showing the relative load of the SQL vs the other SQL.  If that SQL's load bar is all CPU, it's spending 100% of it's time on CPU but it doesn't mean it's using 100% CPU on the host. The % CPU usage on the host can be seen in the Load chart.

Zombadog, et al, >>There are no plans to deprecate the Thumbnail service. The Thumbnail service is about the only part of the web search products Alexa OUGHT to deprecate! My startup search engine is using a competing MUCH better thumbnail service.My search engine is basically pre-release beta at the moment....I have my own crawler machines & software setup to crawl the web & I was planning on using Alexa primarily to get data about places where my crawlers have been blocked.I'm also using Yahoo! BOSS, results from there are live on my beta search sites now, along with thumbnails from a much better service than the Amazon/Alexa offering.BOSS is nice in that it's free, unlimited results, etc, BUT it has some drawbacks.Esp. it's goes down for a few hours at a time every so often, it has sometimes gone down at the same time I've been working on code for it, which of course made me think my code was broken until the boss forum lights up with complaints. I had planned on using the Alexa search API as a live backup for when Yahoo BOSS goes down.My own crawlers results supplement boss/alexa results but I can't afford enough crawlers myself to crawl the whole web, they are meant mainly for targeted crawling of sites/pages alexa, yahoo, etc does not crawl very well, and when I want to verify certain data. Alexa seems to almost never crawl certain sites as deep as I know is neccecary, all the missing pages on archive.org probably prove that.There are a number of things AWS allowed which yahoo does not, such as storing the results of your searches, using it for ""spider food"" for your own crawlers. Yahoo requires you add a url which goes thru Yahoo on your search engine so they can track each click, for each and EVERY search engine result.Yahoo boss just has too many needless seeming, and arbitrary restrictions in it's terms of use, which the Alexa AWS search api does not.Yahoo Boss TOS:http://info.yahoo.com/legal/us/yahoo/search/bosstos/bosstos-2317.htmlI don't think I can create a quality search alternative with only my own crawler data and Yahoo BOSS data, due mainly to the numerous serious restrictions on the usage of Yahoo BOSS data, such as this one:""You will not, will not attempt, or will not permit or take actions designed to enable other third parties to:"" ... ""(iv) access or use the Services for the purpose of aggregating, analyzing, extracting, or repurposing any Yahoo! branded properties;"" And of course also, ""Yahoo! may suspend Your access to and use of the Services"" ... ""if"" ...

We would also like to know this. We heard that the Alexa Web Search is going to be discontinued soon, and that wouldn't affect us if we still had access to the S3 crawl bucket and we could get a list of .arc.gz files, since we would just like to process these files. What would be ideal is if everyday a file was created in the S3 crawl bucket which would contain the list of .arc.gz files created/stored for that day.  Then once a day we could launch an ec2 instance, process the new .arc.gz files and download the results.At the moment, we've found the only way to get a list of arc files is to run ""million result"" search queries and identify the arc files (the 5th column).  This takes a lot of work and will no longer be an option for us next year.Does anyone have any suggestions or advice?  We'd be happy to use ec2 for processing if we could only get a list of files to process.  Thanks."

I am getting intermittent but frequent empty results back from Alexa search.

//execute the search after user has set the parameters
public function alexaSearchExecute()
{	$query_url=$this->generate_url($this->keyword);
	$this->raw_alexa_results=$this->make_http_request($query_url); // CURL function 
	return $this->resultsAsArray($this->raw_alexa_results);
}

// output function - converts the alexa result xml to an array
private function resultsAsArray($r)// uses PHP's simplexml_load_string for xml to array

	$xml=simplexml_load_string($r);
	if(is_object($xml))
	{	if($xml->getName()==='SearchResponse')
		{	if($xml->SearchResult)
			$result_set['totalDocumentsFound']=(int)$xml->SearchResult->EstimatedNumberOfDocuments;
			if($xml->SearchResult->QueryCorrection){$result_set['queryCorrection']=(string)$xml->SearchResult->QueryCorrection;}
			$ri=0;
    	foreach($xml->SearchResult->Document as $document)
			{ $result_set['documents'][$ri]['title']=(string)$document->Title;
			  $result_set['documents'][$ri]['url']=(string)$document->Url;
				$result_set['documents'][$ri]['description']=(string)$document->Context;
				$ri++;
			}
		}
		elseif($xml->getName()==='ErrorResponse')
		{ // alexa response error - try to get cached results and alert admin
			$result_set['error'].=""|||TYPE:"".$xml->Error->Type.""\r\nCODE:"".$xml->Error->Code.""\r\nMESSAGE:"".$xml->Error->Message;
		}
		else // undetermined alexa error
		{	$result_set['error'].=""|||UNDETERMINED ALEXA ERROR"";
		}
	}
	else
	{ // non alexa error - try to get cached results and alert admin

	}
	return $result_set;
}

As you can see the second function turns the raw results from Alexa into an XML object($xml), and then checks that $xml is an object before loading the $result_set array with the data. Any errors detected are appended to $result_set['error'].

The actual script that shows the results to the user checks if $result_set['error']=='' and if it !='' shows a friendly error message and emails the admin the contents of $result_set['error'].

I frequently get these errors emailed to me - 

/search.php
2008/09/04 02:11:56
\|||XML OBJECT ERROR

---

---

This error indicates that $this->raw_alexa_results contained only a line ending ie. no XML was returned.
Because this is an intermittent error it seems like an error on Alexa's end rather than CURL failing on our server.

Any feed back would be appreciated."

I'm considering using AWS for a project, I'm particularly interested in startGrep.   However I noticed a cost remark that might make it a non-starter:On http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AlexaWebSearch/2007-03-15/MSR_GrepAction.html it says ""<span style=""color: #660000"">Note: Since the StartGrep action is billed per CPU hour used to process the request, the MaxNumberOfCPUHours sets the maximum you can be charged for a request. The minimum charge is 0.5 CPU hours."" </span><span style=""color: #000000"">(@ $1 per CPU hour).  Does this mean that if I run a startGrep against say only 500 pages, that by my estimate should take about 18 CPU seconds (0.005 CPU hrs), that I'm going to be billed $0.50 (the charge for 1/2 CPU hour) for this execution of startGrep rather than $0.005 that reflects the actual pro-rata amount of 18 CPU seconds to 1 CPU hour?Second and finally an aside question: To what degree might actual processing time be less that CPU time since multiple processors are used?   Best and thanks in advance,  - Jerry</span>"
Alexa Web Search	"Re: Cost of startGrep (""grep the web"")?
Hi,Yes, you are charged a minimum of $.50.Except for short jobs (such as 500 pages) the actual wall-clock time processing time will be less than the CPU time because there are multiple threads and/or multiple processors working on the job.- GregAlexa"
Alexa Web Search	"Can't access Alexa crawl bucket
Hi.  I did a million search query and got the results.  Now, I'd like to start grabbing the files from the cache, but I'm having a problem (I'm using boto but that probably doesn't matter)

bucket = conn.get_bucket(""com.alexa.crawl"")
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in ?
  File ""/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.4/lib/python2.4/site-packages/boto-1.4c-py2.4.egg/boto/s3/connection.py"", line 232, in get_bucket

bucket = conn.get_bucket(""camill8_test"")


So I get an ""access denied"" error when trying to get the ""com.alexa.crawl"" bucket.  Is this where the cache files live?  Do I have to be on an EC2 instance when I try to access this bucket?  I have my s3 authentication tokens correct, since as you can see, I was able to access a bucket I created just fine.  I also can do web search queries so I know I'm signed up for that service too.  Any ideas what the problem is?  Thanks!"
Alexa Web Search	"Re: Can't access Alexa crawl bucket
Hi,You don't have permission to list all of the objects in the com.alexa.crawl bucket, so the bucket.get_all_keys won't work.   You do have permission to get any individual object that is returned in the results.- GregAlexa"
Alexa Web Search	"Re: Can't access Alexa crawl bucket
I see.  You are right.  For the record, the following line is what I should have used:

bucket = conn.get_bucket(""com.alexa.crawl"", validate=False)

The validate keeps it from trying to get a list of all the keys.

Thanks again!"
Alexa Web Search	"how are MSR results ranked?
Are the URLs ranked in any particular order in Million Search Results?  We recently got a set of 500K results and were expecting them to be more or less random, but they actually seemed to be ranked in some kind of relevance order..."
Alexa Web Search	"Re: how are MSR results ranked?
Yes, the results are returned sorted in order of their relevance score.- GregAlexa"
Alexa Web Search	"Re: how are MSR results ranked?
But they don't match the ranking that you get for the same query on www.alexa.com ?"
Alexa Web Search	"Re: how are MSR results ranked?
The StartSearch action of MSR searches the full search index.  The search on www.alexa.com uses the Search action.    The Search action first searches additional indices that are optimized for common web queries and recent events.- GregAlexa"
Alexa Web Search	"Pricing of Million Search Results + Grep The Web
I am bit puzzled on pricing of this scenario:I want to run a Million Search Results - let's say it returns 1 million results - then I want to use Grep on it - let's say it reduces the results to 1000. How much I am paying for such a query? (I don't need to get that million results just that filtered 1000)Thank you!"
Alexa Web Search	"Re: Pricing of Million Search Results + Grep The Web
Hi,They arebilled separately.You make a request using the StartSearch action to get 1,000,000 results.  That's billed at <span class=""small"">$0.15 per 10,000 results  = $15.   You can examine the results at this point.Then you use the StartGrep on those results.  The processing time is billed at $1/CPU hour.- GregAlexa</span>"
Alexa Web Search	"Re: Pricing of Million Search Results + Grep The Web
Thanks Greg! I thought if there was any chance that it was cheaper and I misunderstood the pricing. But no worries, grep must be expensive as I can't find any other company on the net that would be doing it."

Hi, 

We are developing an application for the Alexa Web Search which will reward webmasters for putting the search onto their site. Our main concern is that 'some' will use their own search for personal gain - a bit like clicking on your own adsense ads. 

The solutions we have are to 

1. put in a captcha script but this is prohibitive 
2. to monitor the webmaster's IP but they can change that 
3. use cookes but again not effective 
4. or a combination of all three - 

We obviously want to avoid abuse of the search as there is a cost to us so can anyone please suggest a security measure that is more robust 

May thanks in advance"
Alexa Web Search	"online search simple
Okay, the MSR online applet is good, but is there a similar applet for simple search?I only need 5000 results and I don't mind just 200 at a time, but I'm not a VB man, so I need a basic online interface.Any ideas?"
Alexa Web Search	"Re: online search simple
The MSR applet is really meant for testing, and the closest equivalent for simple search would be the search box on the Alexa web site: http://www.alexa.com .  The number of results you can get is limited, though.Apart from that, you'd have to do a little programming, or at least plug your AWS keys into an existing code sample.  Besides VB, there are samples in Java, C#, Perl, Ruby, etc., at http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/kbcategory.jspa?categoryID=97 ."

Alexa Web Search	"Expiration of cached results?
Hi,When trying to retrieve cached pages immediately after getting the results, I have no problems. But when trying to do the same after some time, I get ""access denied"" for some of the cached pages. Is there an expiration time for cached pages?Thanks, Amit"
Alexa Web Search	"Re: Expiration of cached results?
Pages do expire from the cache after two months."
Alexa Web Search	"Re: Expiration of cached results?
Is it two months from the day they were cached or from the day I got the results?Because I see it happening after a couple of days.."
Alexa Web Search	"Re: Expiration of cached results?
From the day they were cached."
Alexa Web Search	"inconsistent number of results
Hi,When searching for a phrase and limiting the number of results to 100000 I'm getting ~40000 results. When searching for the same phrase and limiting to 300000 I'm getting ~200000. Why is this happening?(I'm asking for cached documents only)Thanks, Amit"
Alexa Web Search	"Re: inconsistent number of results
If you're using the StartSearch action, the MaxNumberOfDocuments parameter sets an upper limit for the number of results you'll receive, but you're not guaranteed to get that many.  We try to give you as close to MaxNumberOfDocuments as possible, but the actual number of results you'll get depends on a number of factors including the particular query."
Alexa Web Search	"Re: inconsistent number of results
I understand that, but I'm performing the exact same query with different limits.When I'm performing it with a high limit I get more results than the lower limit.e.g. when I limit it to 300000 I get ~200000, which is more than 100000.So why don't I get the full 100000, when I'm asking for it?"
Alexa Web Search	"Re: inconsistent number of results
I'm afraid I can't go into the details of why, but you're right -- if you ask for more, you get more.  And as I mentioned before, it's not really possible to know in advance how many results you'll get."
Alexa Web Search	"Re: inconsistent number of results
Thanks for the clarification.As I see it, you could just pretend I asked for more and give back a subset the size I actually wanted. As a customer it feels that I'm not getting the service I want, with no real reason.That said, this service is a dream comes true, so I shouldn't complain too much"
Alexa Web Search	"MSR + SiteThrottle
Using the MSR online applet to test a search, I'm unable to get anyresults for a search when I include 'SiteThrottle=4' in the query.Any ideas please?e.g. I enter the following in the query textbox...football AND SiteThrottle=4and the result is# No results for query: football AND SiteThrottle=4"
Alexa Web Search	"Re: MSR + SiteThrottle
SiteThrottle is a separate request parameter from Query -- see http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AlexaWebSearch/2007-03-15/MSR_SearchAction.html .  What you're typing in the MSR applet is just the Query.  Unfortunately that interface doesn't support SiteThrottle.

Hi, I'm new to the forum.

Hi,As far as searching for image URLs, the crawler prioritizes html docs much more than other types.   The documentation says that ""Note: As of November 2007, about 93% of the pages in the search index were html.""    This number is now about 98%.So, if you want to get a large number of image URLs, your approach would need to be to:- Use the MSR feature to locate html pages that are of interest to you.- Then, either use the StartGrep feature to harvest image URLs from those documents.

Alexa Web Search	"Re: Getting 0 results when searching by date
Hi Joey,When running more complex searches (like using the date: field), sometimes it takes a bit for those queries to execute. In some instances they actually timeout, for this you will see a <MaxTimeReached>true</MaxTimeReached> in the xml returned. This was probably the case for your first search and then the server was ready for your second same search to be run.To make sure it does go either run the search again (like you did) or increase the Maxtime limit beyond the standard 3 seconds.Best,-Ryan"
Alexa Web Search	"Re: Getting 0 results when searching by date

Alexa Web Search	"Re: Vertical Search?
The $0.30/search covers a single search for all 1000 URLs. Considering you are doing 1000 searches for $0.30, that is a bargin. Whether you use the standard websearch or MSR, the ""site:amazon.com"" field will work for both.MSR returns results for our crawl files on S3 but you will need to keep them on S3 and use EC2 to process those matching crawl files.

Is it possible to run hundreds of them per second or is there a frequency limit per key?Thanks."
Alexa Web Search	"Re: Getting the number of results -- costs?
Hi,There are a couple of options:1. You can get an estimate of the number of documents that match using the Search action.   The estimated number of matches is returned in the EstimatedNumberOfDocuments element. Your request would look like (not all parameters shown):http://wsearch.amazonaws.com/?Action=Search&Query=cat&ResponseGroup=Results&PageNumber=1&MaxNumberOfDocumentsPerPage=20&...The request above asks for only 20 results.  If there are less than or equal to 20 results, then the EstimatedNumberOfDocuments  would be the actual count.  Otherwise,  it is a statistical estimate.You can make these requests at 20 requests/sec and it would cost $0.30/1000 requests.2. For slightly faster responses you can use the above method, but set the MaxNumberOfDocumentsPerPage=1.3. You could raise the MaxNumberOfDocumentsPerPage=200.  In this case the EstimatedNumberOfDocuments  would return the actual count if there are <= 200 matches, and an estimate otherwise.    These queries are slower and would cost 10x more since you are paying per result returned.    See this thread for more information on pricing: http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/thread.jspa?messageID=855094. To get the most accurate count of the number of documents that match you can use the StartSearch action.     In this case you can ask for up to ten million results by passing in MaxNumberOfDocuments=10000000However, since there is a per-result charge, a single query like this could cost up to  $150 depending on how many results are returned.- GregAlexa

OK, thanks for the tip on MaxNumberOfDocumentsPerPage=1.That should do it.But could you please elaborate on statistical estimates?How accurately do they represent the complete data set?I don't need to know the actual number of matching documents down to a single one, but I need to be able to know with high probability that ""phrase a"" occurs in the database more frequently than ""phrase b"" but less frequently than ""phrase c"".Is the estimation good enough for such purposes or is it based on combining frequencies of occurrence of each individual keyword in the phrase to make a guess?Thanks."

                Thank you so much Ryan for your prompt response.<br/><br/>I actually did already try a similar way of doing it, by assigning it <br/>as a variable inside the existing foreach loop as such:<br/>$rTotal = $result[&#39;EstimatedNumberOfDocuments&#39;];<br/>but was not able to access the from outside the loop because I assume its value <br/>is empty after the second run.<br/>Also, since this foreach is mainly parsing the &lt;document&gt; array and it has a counter<br/>the EstimatedNumberOfDocuments was assigned its own number as being the number 1 result.<br/><br/>I ended up giving it it&#39;s own foreach loop. and was able to access its value as needed.<br/><br/>As I was reading a some related tutorials I thought there was a simpler way to directly <br/>access this value since it is not an array with something similar to this:<br/>$rTotal = $results-&gt;SearchResponse-&gt;SearchResult-&gt;EstimatedNumberOfDocuments;<br/>But none of the different variations of the above that I tried worked.<br/>Any ideas if this is another way to get at it.<br/><br/>I did manage to accomplish what I needed with your help, much appreciated.<br/><br/><br/>Couple of other questions if I may:<br/>1- Quote: &quot;The service returns up to 5000 search results for a given query. <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; The returned XML response contains up to 200 results at a time.&quot;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; Are we charged by the quantity of links returned or number of calls <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1- I make 1 call with max results to be returned = 200 <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2- I make 10 calls max results to be returned = 20<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; Which of the above is more expensive or are they both the same?<br/><br/>2- I&#39;ve seen references to [QueryCorrection QueryExpansion TrafficRank]<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; Are we able to access these values with the standard xml response?<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought maybe by through adding their group to the RESPONSE_GROUP values.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; Any advice would be much appreciated.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry for the long message, and thank you very much<br/>

                Hi,<br/><br/>You are very welcome, glad you were able to figure it out yourself as well. As for your other questions:<br/><br/>1.&lt;span style=""color: #ff0000""&gt;They are both the same&lt;/span&gt;.<br/><br/>Making 10 requests for 20 results at a time:<br/>10 requests * $0.0003/request =&nbsp; $.003<br/><br/>Getting 200 results at a time:<br/>1 request&nbsp; *&nbsp; $0.0003/request + (200 results - 20 ) * $0.000015/result =&nbsp; $.003<br/><br/>So you can think of it as $0.000015/result with a 20 result minimum.<br/><br/>2. The XML response will change based upon the Response Group you make the request with. If you include all five response groups (Results, Context, QueryCorrection, QueryExpansion, TrafficRank) the xml being returned will be larger but you will still be charged the same price: per request.<br/><br/>Please let me know if you have any further questions, happy developing!<br/><br/>Best,<br/>-Ryan<br/>Message was edited by: Greg@AlexaMessage was edited by: Greg@Alexa<br class=""jive-newline"" />

                Hi,<br/><br/>Another way to state the pricing described at <a class=""jive-link-external"" href=""http://aws.amazon.com/alexawebsearch"">http://aws.amazon.com/alexawebsearch</a> is that you are charged charged <a name=""as11""></a>$0.000015 per result&nbsp; that you actually retrieve with a minimum charge of&nbsp; $0.0003/request.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/><br/>If you make a request and ask for 20 or fewer results back, forexample, you will never be charged more than $0.0003/request (which translates into $.30/1000 requests.)<br/><br/>Here are some prices for example requests:<br/><br/>...Action=Search&amp;Query=cat&amp;MaxNumberOfDocumentsPerPage=10&nbsp; --&gt; $0.0003<br/>...Action=Search&amp;Query=cat&amp;MaxNumberOfDocumentsPerPage=20&nbsp; --&gt; $0.0003<br/><a name=""as11""></a>...Action=Search&amp;Query=cat&amp;MaxNumberOfDocumentsPerPage=100 --&gt; <a name=""as11""></a>$0.0015<br/>...Action=Search&amp;Query=cat&amp;MaxNumberOfDocumentsPerPage=200 --&gt;<a name=""as11""></a> $0.003<br/><br/>If you make an obscure query that doesn&#39;t return any results, you will only be charged for the results that are returned.&nbsp; The query below asks for 200 results, but doesn&#39;t actually return any, so you are charged the minimum $0.0003/request.<br/><br/>...Action=Search&amp;Query=some+strange+query+blah+blah+kakalakaka&amp;MaxNumberOfDocumentsPerPage=200<br/>--&gt; $0.0003<br/><br/>- Greg<br/>Alexa<br/><br/>P.S.&nbsp; For more complex queries you are also charged for the complexity of the query as described in the pricing on <a class=""jive-link-external"" href=""http://aws.amazonaws.com/alexawebsearch&nbsp;"">http://aws.amazonaws.com/alexawebsearch&nbsp;</a> and the FAQs linked to from that page.<br/>

                Thank you Greg for clarifying the pricing scheme.<br/><br/>There would be a huge difference in total end cost between the first scenario given and yours (price being the same or not).<br/>10 to 1 difference to be precise according to my needs. I am glad I looked back again at this thread.<br/><br/>Thanks again, and I am glad that it is priced the way it is now, I can try and develop what I need while optimizing the total end cost.<br/><br/>Thanks to both of you.<br/>

Alexa Web Search	"Re: Status 500 - with over 1000 results
Hi Senthil,Yes <span style=""font-size: x-small"">the upper limit is 5000. You might have seen a transitory error with the service. Are you still seeing this? We can't reproduce it.Also, terms are ANDed by default so you shouldn't use an AND in your query. Also, if you want to do a phrase search you need to use double quotes and not single ones.Please refer to the syntax section in the manual for this information:http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AlexaWebSearch/2007-03-15/SearchSyntax_GeneralQuerySyntaxArticle.htmlBest,-Ryan</span>"

Just a follow-up to my previous question (""Is the web service supposed to return search results that match thesearch results on www.alexa.com. i.e. will the order of the URLs be thesame?""). I have attached the request and responce TCP dumps (removed the accesskey info). You will notice that the response is missing any description at all and the order of the search results is slightly different.Any pointers?"
Alexa Web Search	"Re: Order of search results - WS vs Website
Hi,The website search is tailored for the user based upon what the browser passes to us. Language, location, etc are all variables that changes the search results on the website to fit each user request.The web service is not tailored or filtered in any way, it is the baseline search and nothing else unless you specify otherwise.Best,-Ryan"

I have updated the class, cleaned up a bit.  Also added built in thumbnailing.Here is Usage:$alexa = new alexasearch('key', 'secret key'); // search( search term, page number, max results displayed)       // search now returns an array of results.$res = $alexa->search('php', 1, 10);                $html = '<table>';        foreach($res as $r){    // thumbnail( array of urls, size - small or large, default image)    // I used list() here because Im only requesting one image at a time    list($thumbnail) = $alexa->thumbnail(array($r['url']));    $html .= '<tr>                    <td>                       <img src=""'.$thumbnail.'""></td>                    <td>                       <h4><a href=""'.$r['url'].'"">'.$r['title'].'</a></h4>                       <p>'.$r['context'].'</p>                    </td>                  </tr>';        }        $html .= '</table>'; die($html);Hope this helps.  If you have any questions you can email me at: wcope[at]frenzylabs[dot]com

Alexa Web Search	"Getting multiple 403 responses
Hi, I have been using the Alexa web search service at the past few days and keep getting 403 error code pages.I believe it is happening for more then 50% of the requests...This is how I use the service:<span style=""color: #1f497d"">http://wsearch.amazonaws.com/?AWSAccessKeyId=<key>&Timestamp=2008-03-17T13:07:01.905Z&Signature=<signature>&Version=2007-03-15&Action=Search&ResponseGroup=Results&Query=""Pasha+Bitz""</span>Can you please help me prevent those 403...Thanks,<span>GiladZirkel.</span>"
Alexa Web Search	"Re: Getting multiple 403 responses
Hi,Could you please check the XML that is returned when you get a 403 response?There will be an error string explaining the cause of the error.  The errors are documented on the ""Making Requests --> Errors"" page  of  the Developer's Guide http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AlexaWebSearch/2007-03-15/It seems to me that the most likely cause is that you are not URL encoding your signature or timestamp.    If you look on the ""Making Requests --> Query Results"" page of the Developer's Guide, there is a recipe for making valid signatures.Could you post a few more URLs of requests that are returning 403, including the Signature parameters.Thanks,GregAlexa"
