AWS Support API	"How do you calculate the ""Signature"" value for an Amazon MWS query in VB6
Please help!

I'm trying to submit queries to Amazon's servers to get information on our orders and I know nothing about HMAC, SHA-256, etc. I've managed to get everything set up in a Visual Basic 6 program in order to submit the XML queries, but I get an error message from the Amazon server saying that the ""Signature"" parameter is required. Does anyone know how you can use VB6 to come up with this value and for that matter, what information does Amazon want me to feed into a function in order to come up with the value? 

I've read the Amazon MWS Orders API Section Reference manual, but it seems to make a lot of assumptions about the signature value without spelling it out.

Thanks,

Well first start with the MWS API for guidance.

Docs are here:
https://developer.amazonservices.com/gp/mws/docs.html

Also...... don't know of anything for VB6 but maybe this will help:

https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/mwsportal/doc/en_US/fba/inventory/v20101001/MWSDeveloperGuide.V175102177.pdf

Creating an Amazon MWS Request

Amazon MWS supports query requests for calling web service actions. Query requests are simple HTTP requests, using the GET or POST method with query parameters in the URL or HTTP body, respectively. Amazon MWS requires the use of HTTPS to prevent third party eavesdropping on your communication with Amazon.

Each of the HTTP header lines must be terminated with a carriage return and a line feed. Query requests must contain an Action parameter to indicate the action to be performed. The response is an XML document.

The Amazon MWS Developer Guide goes into detail on how to create a valid HTTP query request. Note that Amazon MWS Scratchpad is a helpful tool for understanding how to create correctly formed HTTP query requests. Amazon MWS Scratchpad automatically generates and displays many of the inputs that are required in a HTTP query request to Amazon MWS. Examining the Amazon MWS responses that Amazon MWS Scratchpad displays for each of your query requests can help you build successful parsing logic.

AWS Support API	"Re: How do you calculate the ""Signature"" value for an Amazon MWS query in VB6
Thank you for the reply. I appreciate the help.

Let me make myself clear.

I already know how to submit queries to Amazon. I'm am 99% of the way there - I have submitted queries and received an error message from the Amazon server stating that the ""Signature"" field is required. 

I have further (since my last post) gathered some informatiion on SHA-256 encryption and I believe that I have the VB code that I need in order to generate the signature.

I can't TEST that my code works because I have no idea what Amazon wants me to use as a ""key"" (I've assumed that this is either my AWS Access Key ID or my Secret Key, but I can't find anywhere in the documentation that tells me what to use) and further, I don't know what the string is that I'm supposed to submit for encryption.

I have already used the MWS Scratchpad (again, before writing my first inquiry) and because of that, I know that the Signature value changes even if you are requesting the same data, so I'm assuming that whatever this elusive string is that I submit for encryption to create the Signature value also changes, presumably because the timestamp is part of the string.

Is that clearer?

Let's pretend that I already have a simple function like:

Signature=(""key"", ""message"")

that did the encryption using SHA-256 and further conversion to Base 64 HMAC (please forgive me if I've worded something strangely - this is new territory for me). I may actually have this now, but I don't have any way to test it BECAUSE...

My problem right now is that I have no idea what to use instead of ""key"" or ""message"" in order to arrive at the Signature. Anyone who could at least tell me WHERE in the many Amazon manuals I can find the section on what these two pieces are would be my friend for life and could have Christmas dinner at my house.

Thanks,

SSssssooooooo ... you didn't follow the link to MWSDeveloperGuide and read page 12 ..... did you? ; )

Creating a query request

To create an Amazon MWS query request, you first construct a query string with the query information.

You then sign this query string and include it in the request submission. Note that the query string cannot contain white space or line breaks. The string consists of:

• The HTTP action. This value is most often POST.
• The domain name of the request, such as https://mws.amazonservices.com/. For a list of endpoints for each Amazon marketplace, see the Amazon MWS Endpoints section in this guide. After the endpoint is a forward slash (/), which separates the endpoint from the parameters.
• AWSAccessKeyId (click to get one)—Your Amazon MWS account is identified by your Access Key ID, which Amazon MWS uses to look up your Secret Access Key.
• Action—The action you want to perform on the endpoint, such as the operation
GetFeedSubmissionResult.
• Parameters—Any required and optional request parameters.
• Marketplace—Your Marketplace ID.
• Merchant or SellerId—Your Merchant ID.
• SignatureMethod—The HMAC hash algorithm you are using to calculate your signature, either SHA256 or SHA1.
• SignatureVersion—Which signature version is being used. This is Amazon MWS-specific information that tells Amazon MWS the algorithm you used to form the string that is the basis of the signature. For Amazon MWS, this value is currently SignatureVersion=2.
• Timestamp—Each request must contain the timestamp of the request. Depending on the API function you're using, you can provide an expiration date and time for the request instead of or in addition to the timestamp.
• Version—The version of the API section being called.
The following example is a query string for a GetFeedSubmissionResult request.
Note: The example query string contains line breaks and white space which are shown for ease of reading. The actual query string cannot contain white space or line breaks. All query string examples in this guide are formatted for readability.

Example I will UNformat):
POST
mws.amazonservices.com
/ 
AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAFJPPO5KLY6G4XO7Q&Action=GetFeedSubmissionResult&FeedSubmissionId=4321011681&Marketplace=ATVPDKIKX0DER&Merchant=A3F1LGRLCQDI4D&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2011-02-04T23%3A08%3A19Z&Version=2009-01-01


I have already used the MWS Scratchpad

Click on Request Detail see see the string also....

AWS Support API	"Re: How do you calculate the ""Signature"" value for an Amazon MWS query in VB6
All right, either I'm really dim (the most likely case) or you're not understanding my question. Yes, I've read that part of the manual. As far as I can tell it says NOTHING about how to calculate the signature value. I'm sure it's in there, but it's not in the stuff you posted on this thread and not in anything I've been able to find.

The sample in your reply is much like the one's I've sent to Amazon - it does NOT contain the parameter (which I am assuming is just part of the submission string) &Signature=(whateverthe signature is). When I post queries to Amazon that are similar to the one you listed as an example, it comes back with an error saying that the Signature parameter is required.

I've also found nothing in the Amazon manual that says what is used to create the Signature value. I need to encrypt something with a key value using HMAC-SHA-256 -  what is that string that I need to encrypt and what do I use for the key value?"
AWS Support API	"Re: How do you calculate the ""Signature"" value for an Amazon MWS query in VB6
Maybe I'm getting this now. Is the manual saying that the string to encrypt is:

AWSAccessKeyId=&ltAccess Key Removed>&Action=GetFeedSubmissionResult&FeedSubmissionId=4321011681&Marketplace=ATVPDKIKX0DER&Merchant=A3F1LGRLCQDI4D&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2011-02-04T23%3A08%3A19Z&Version=2009-01-01

in the example?

If so, how do you then send the Signature parameter? Do you add it onto this string? Do you send it instead of this string?"

SSssssssooooooooooo  CCCCcccllllllllloooooosssssseeeee ...LOL

I think some of the confusion is in looking closely at the ScratchPad I don't see where they show you the signed URL. It might be in a different version I have.

Also let me add in here that I'm still not sure about how to do what exactly because I'm not a programmer.

I just know that basics.................

Look at my post with ""Example I will UNformat):""

THAT whole thing is the string to (sign) encrypt......... as noted in the Developer Guide top of page 13.

If you look at the tab in ScratchPad, ""Request Details"", towards the bottom in a blue bar it says ""String to sign"" and has:

POST
mws.amazonservices.com
/ 
AWSAccessKeyId=********&Action=GetFeedSubmissionResult&FeedSubmissionId=4371429174&Merchant=****&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2011-09-12T18%3A57%3A05Z&Version=2009-01-01


So you do something like a ...
HmacSHA256 (
POST
mws.amazonservices.com
/ 
AWSAccessKeyId=********&Action=GetFeedSubmissionResult&FeedSubmissionId=4371429174&Merchant=****&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2011-09-12T18%3A57%3A05Z&Version=2009-01-01)


Then take that signature and do the HTTP post or add it to the URL ... A completed one looks like this and is at the bottom of page 14 / top 15.

https://mws.amazonservices.com/AWSAccessKeyId=********
&Action=GetFeedSubmissionResult
&FeedSubmissionId=**** 
&Merchant=ANZE9ULNDLIJJ
&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256
&SignatureVersion=2
&Timestamp=2011-09-12T18%3A57%3A05Z
&Version=2009-01-01
&Signature=******************
1HTTP/1.1Host:mws.amazonservices.comX-Am
azon-User-Agent:AmazonJavascriptApp/1.0(Language=Javascript)Content-Type:text/xml


Not exactly sure about that 1HTTP/ ... copied from example but the 1 may not go in there.

After that you're on your own.... Base 64? MD5 ??? Not much of a clue.

I've got it working in Java but I got away from the signed request and went to opening/connecting to the WebServiceClient .....not even 100% on how I did that...LOL

Thanks for all the responses, however, I'm not sure they are exactly what I am looking for. I think my explanation wasn't very clear.To simplify, forgot any consideration of my website. I just want to be able buy things off Amazon.com with a script. For example, have a PHP script that accepts a product id and shipping address, and when called, accesses an Amazon.com web service to place an order with instructions to ship to the given address. Ideally, this would be done without human input; however, if necessary, it do something like queue orders and simply have a human rubber stamp it. Don't worry, I know how to code the PHP - I am not asking someone to do the job for me. I just don't know of any Amazon published web service that would allow for that functionality.@mark: It seems to me that Corporate accounts still require a human to physically place the order.@Joel: I initially looked at the Associate's program, but I could only find product advertising tools there. Everything dealt with referrals and links back to Amazon.com.

AWS Support API	"Re: Using FWS to buy any Amazon item?
I have a similar requirment from my client, who wants a semi ""secret santa"" application where users can buy an amazon item for another user.

the problem with the associate program is that it requires the user to go through the entire purchase, including filling out the shipping adress, which for privacy reasons, our users do not want to be publicly available.(although we(the host) internally have the addresses for each user)

A function where my company can trigger a purchase of a specific amazon item with a shipping adress  is all we really need, but I am afraid this does not exist. Can FWS do this?

I suppose we could let the user simply choose an item(but not buy it).  An we could manually make the purchase for them, but this has obvious scalablitly issues, and we would not be getting the associate percentage..

Has anyone else solved the bug in the FBA Outbound API - PHP sample code? When creating a ""CreateFulfillmentOrder"" the documentation is lacking quite a bit on how to add items. Fumbling around I created the following process to add and item:

=== PHP code ===
// collect item values
$order_item_query 		= ""SELECT * FROM order_details WHERE order_id ='"".$receipt_number.""'"";
$order_item_result 	= $db -> Execute($order_item_query)

	$afn_item-> setSellerSKU($order_item_row);
	$afn_item-> setSellerFulfillmentOrderItemId($receipt_number.""-"".$order_item_row);

	$afn_item-> setDisplayableComment(""This is an example DisplayableComment"");

The problem is when it is called I found there is a mistake / error / bug in the sample code. The sample 'Client.php' file calls ""$itemscreateFulfillmentOrderRequest->getmember()"" but the getmember() function does not exist.

I replaced:
$itemscreateFulfillmentOrderRequest = $request->getItems();
foreach ($itemscreateFulfillmentOrderRequest->getmember() as $memberitemsIndex => $memberitems) {

with the following:
foreach ($request->getItems() as $memberitemsIndex => $memberitems) {
                if ($memberitems->isSetSellerSKU()) {

... but now I get an error from the server saying:
Caught Exception: The request must contain the parameter Items.

Yet, here http://www.amazon.com/gp/seller-account/mm-product-page.html?topic=200274770 it clearly shows that FBA is enabled as an individual seller and that there is no monthly fee at all. Only a free per sell. 

Why the contradiction? Can I use FBA selling maybe 5-10 items a month and not LOSE money; getting 25$ in sales of 2$ bath powder packets that I have no use for, then getting charged 40$?

I LOVE FBA; nothing beats throwing a bunch of stuff you bought and didn't need into a box and having Amazon sell it for you, but I definitely don't sell anywhere near the 40 items a month that Amazon recommends I be selling in order to be a ""pro merchant"" and be charged $39.99, monthly.

AWS Support API	"Re: GetInventorySupply - identify if fulfilled by Merchant or FBA
Josh,

Thank-you!

Here is the issue.

When the item goes to zero on FBA which I detect with GetInventorySupply we then remove the item
from FBA to be fulfilled by merchant by uploading the item data using AMTU.

However when we want to send new stock to FBA we need to update the inventory listing (done via
seller central) for the shipping labels and this changes the fulfillment to FBA even though the stock isn't there.

Therefore after we ship I want to put it back to being fulfilled by merchant till the 
inventory arrives.

What I noticed with GetInventorySupply is that it doesn't seem to differentiate btw an item 
which is fulfilled by Merchant and FBA (Both show zero quantity).

Thats why I""m looking for some data element which will indicate that its FBA so I can switch it back to Merchant.

Hello,
I've used the Signed requests helper to generate a timestamp for me and hard coded that into my code to generate the signature, but I still get this error message:

<ItemLookupErrorResponse xmlns=""http://ecs.amazonaws.com/doc/2011-08-02/""><Error><Code>InvalidParameterValue</Code><Message>Value '2012-07-23T05:47:39.000Z' for parameter Timestamp is invalid.

I used the gmdate(""Y-m-d\TH:i:s\Z"") php code to generate the timestamp (which doesn't include the .000) and that didn't work, so then I tried using the helper to generate a timestamp for me (the one above) and that still didn't work.

AWS Support API	"3dcart help - ""The AWS Access Key Id needs a subscription for the service""
3dcart store with CBA and FBA. CBA works and communicates perfectly. FBA not at all. I have repeatedly checked my access keys and all seems to be well. I am using my AWS keys in the ""Amazon FBA"" Plugin within 3dCart. 

I get the message: ""The AWS Access Key Id needs a subscription for the service."" in the notes for any order. I am assuming that means there is some sort of communication, and it's just a config problem. I believe that I have tried all of the methods seen in the forums including setting us SES but to no avail. 

Does anyone have any insight? I am losing my mind and my client is losing his patience.

BTW, I also checked the billing with AWS. All is and has been good. I have emailed and spoken on the phone with several reps (free customer service obviously) and they all say our account is in fine shape and have no idea what that message could mean. Amazon blames 3d cart and 3d cart blames Amazon. I'm sure it's something that I am overlooking but I am obviously beyond helping myself at this point.

Hi alumaskin,

If you are trying to use Amazon Fulfillment Web Service (FWS), then I recommend ensuring that you are subscribed to the service by going here and clicking ""Sign up for Amazon FWS"":

http://aws.amazon.com/fws/

If you have already subscribed to Amazon FWS and are still getting that error message when issuing FWS API calls, then please complete the following online form:

https://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/html-forms-controller/contactus/aws-account-and-billing

If you are not using Amazon FWS and are only using Checkout By Amazon and Fulfillment By Amazon, then we aren't able to provide any assistance with those services since they are not provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS).  The list of AWS products that we do support is available here:

Hi - If you grab the current version of the FWS Outbound WSDL, you'll see a new operation there called ""GetFulfillmentPreview"", which will provide available shipping speeds, estimated fulfillment fees, ship and delivery date estimates, etc., given a ship-to address and list of items. It doesn't actually create an order, or reserve any inventory, but gives a good indication of what would happen to the order if it were submitted in the next few minutes. It's intended for the kind of use-case you describe: supporting checkout pages, etc.Proper documentation is in the works, but the WSDL is reasonably well-documented.

AWS Support API	"Re: Can Amazon FWS be integrated with Ebay, PayPal or ProStores?
I'm certain that we could integrate Ebay with FBA. (ie Grab your eBay orders and submit them to FBA for fullfillment, and then grab the shipping/tracking data from FBA and use that information to update eBay directly so that buyers who look for shipping status in MyEbay will see the latest tracking info.

If SolidCommerce has an API for retrieving orders and submitting shipping/tracking data, we could use that API to integrate SolidCommerce with FBA. If SolidCommerce has no such API, but they have the capability to export orders via CSV data files and import shipping/tracking data via CSV data files, then we could make something like that work as well.

Call or email anytime.. I'd be happy to brainstorm with you what might be your best approach overall.

We receive 10 pcs to FBA, of which 10 are made available to sell on the amazon marketplace automatically.  We also sell that same sku on eBay and have that sku listed on ebay at 10 pcs.  In real time (or as close to it) as items sell on either marketplace we are looking for a solution that would adjust the active quantity of the sku.

Amazon listing:
Sony Playstation video game package-initial qty 10
3 sell.

Ebay listing:
Sony Playstation PS3 video game package brand new in box- initial qty 10
2 sell.

Ending qty: 5 sitting in amazon.  System needs to update that ebay listing has only 5 pieces, and same for amazon.

3rd PIECE-

AWS Support API	"Re: MerchantServiceQuery Error with Inventory Template
Hi N. Corporation,

I'm sorry to hear about the trouble you've encountered.  It is nice of you to include the complete error message you received.  That type of detailed information can greatly assist in most troubleshooting situations.

Based on the error message, it simply sounds like you need to subscribe to the ""MerchantQueryService"".

I can confirm that there is no such service provided by AWS.  All services of AWS are listed here:

http://aws.amazon.com/products/

That being said, I tried to see if I could find more information about that service so I could at least point you in the right direction.  The only remotely helpful clue I could find was in this documentation covering transitioning from AIM to MWS (both of which are services provided by ""Amazon Services"", not AWS):

https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/02/mwsportal/doc/bde/AIM_to_Amazon_MWS_Migration_Guide._V180902185_.pdf


It's mentioned being used for Order Fulfillment and Canceling Orders which is discussed on pages 9 and 10 of the PDF.  Since the context is one where the reader would be transitioning to using MWS, my best guess is that the MWS team many know about the ""MerchantQueryService"" and may be able to assist you.  With that in mind, you may want to try posting your question in the MWS forums for assistance:

http://www.amazonsellercommunity.com/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=43

I'm sorry I can't provide more specific guidance with the MerchantQueryService.

Hi,

The request you provided was a ""Marketplace Web Service"" Fulfillment API request, not an ""Amazon Web Services"" Fulfillment API request. I know the difference seems minor, but this forum is about the AWS version of the APIs. The newer, MWS version is supported at http://www.amazonsellercommunity.com/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=43. Maybe they can help you?

One thing I notice that might be relevant is that it looks like your timestamp is to greater than a second's precision. Historically, for the AWS version, those have been rejected as not conforming to the standard format AWS uses. Can you try with a timestamp only to 1 second's precision?

AWS Support API	"Item dimensions are associated to the Sku instead of the Product (ASIN)
This is Raja Ramadass from Monsoon and we are one of the integarators of amazon marketplace services. Few of our customers have reported that while sending their product to FBA through shipment, they are getting missing dimensions error from FWS API. 
Please see below for an example. 
ERROR Monsoon.Core.FBA.FBAProvider - Exception getting ShipmentPreview for [sku: 3955, quantity: 1]. Amazon.FWSInbound.AmazonFWSInboundException: Value Invalid parameter for parameter UnknownSku is invalid. Reason: Invalid shipment items. InvalidItems[ (skuType={Enum::MSKU}, sku=3955, reason=MISSING_DIMENSIONS)]. 
at Amazon.FWSInbound.AmazonFWSInboundClient.Invoke[T](IDictionary`2 parameters) 

We recommend our sellers to provide dimensions data for the product on the amazon.com site when they encounter this error and then try adding the item to the shipment. Our understanding is that product data such as item dimensions are associated to the asin /product and not to the sku. However based on our customer reports and our testing, we have found that the dimensions are only stored 
at the sku level and not at the product level. We were able to prove our theory with the following test 


We have attempted to send the item with asin B0023QXCG8 to amazon fulfilment center by creating a shipment through the FWS call 
Missing dimensions error was thrown by the GetShipmentPreview call. 
We have added dimensions information by creating a listing with sku jewel001_loc and attempted to add that item to a shipment and the operation was successful 
When we tried to send another item (same asin asin B0023QXCG8 ) with a different sku say jewel001_usf, we could not add that to a shipment and it failed with missing dimensions error 
We deleted the previously created listing (sku jewel001_loc ) and added another listing for the sku jewel001_usf and provided dimensions information for that sku 
After this, we were able to add the item with sku jewel001_usf to the shipment successfully 


Please let us know whether this is a bug or an expected behavior and based on that we can make appropriate changes to FBA shipment creation process in our product.

AWS Support API	"Regarding FBA revenue calculator for big inventory
Hi,

Iam a seller with growing FBA inventory. Iam not sure this is correct forum. I have tried to find correct department after best technical abilities but this is really not my area of expertise and I hope some one could direct me to correct department or atleast in a good direction.

I have already contacted amazon seller support with below questions but yet not recieved anything helpful. 

To my question then. For bigger sellers who list alot of SKUs, what is best practice for finding out exact fba fee for each asin? Going trough fba calculator one by one is very tedious and time consuming for big inventories (1000+ SKUs). Variable fees like comission varies from 6-15% depending on category and our products are scattered over many categories. Weight based fees and 30 day storage are also variable, thus makes it impossible to just setup an equation in excel. Finding out our breakeven price after FBA fees for each asin is critical for us to decide minimum selling price or in deciding our margin inpact.

If we have our cost price in csv file for every asin, is it possible to fetch exact fees for all asins in the file?

Please advice ASAP. This is a very big issue for us.

Best regards"
AWS Support API	"Re: Regarding FBA revenue calculator for big inventory
I'm afraid we don't currently offer anything like that to see what you would be charged. You would need to do the calculations yourself.

If you are already selling the items, you can use the Sku Net Revenue Tool to see your revenue and what you have been charged. It's an Excel file under Payments Account > Past Settlements in Seller Central.

http://www.amazon.com/X-Files-Beyond-Sea-B/dp/6304153775

We were able to get the FNSKU properly. But calling PutInboundShipmentItems to add the item to shipment resulted in this error:

AWS Support API	"MWS migration workflow questions
Hi
I started looking over the FWS to MWS migration documents and am a bit alarmed at some of the workflow changes.  

Our primary workflow is labeling our items (one by one from your perspective) and then creating an inbound shipment at a later point in time.  Our stations to sticker items and create inbound shipments are completely different stations in the warehouse and sometimes in completely different physical locations.  So it is not possible for us to combine these two steps.  I'll also add that we are dealing with lots of unique items that each get their own fnsku (~500k). It doesn't seem right to be creating a new shipment each time we need to register an fnsku. But anyhow, there doesn't seem to be any other option with the new API, so I'm trying to understand the new workflow around registering fnskus and creating inbound shipments.  

1. If this is a new item (or its condition has changed), I need to call CreateInboundShipmentPlan for the single item, passing over merchant sku, condition, and asin.  
2. CreateInboundShipmentPlan returns an fnsku which we label the item with and store in our database.  And now I need to store DestinationFulfillmentCenterId and ShipmentId for each item in our database too?

And now this is where I'm lost.  Let's say we have a pile of items labeled with fnskus ready to be shipped (also consider many fnskus that may have been registered with the old API), what do I need to do in order to create a new inbound shipment for them?  I don't really understand the workflow in your guide.   Is there anyway just to create a brand new shipment for the items and not have to deal with all this complexity around looking at existing inbound shipments and the destination for each item, etc?

Thanks,
Chris"

AWS Support API	"Shopify and Shipping Options (free shipping? International Shipping?)
Hi,

I'm working on integrating my Shopify ecommerce store with my Amazon account. I currently have stock in inventory at an Amazon warehouse.

I was looking at the Shopify Wiki on Amazon FWS/FBA:  http://wiki.shopify.com/Help:Preferences#Fulfillment_by_Amazon

I have three questions from this:

1: International Shipping A significant percentage of my customers are International. The Shopify Wiki claims FWS can't do international shipping:


Note: Only Amazon USA is supported. Amazon only ships within the USA.

Items configured to use Amazon Fulfillment can ONLY be shipped to US customers via Amazon. See here: http://aws.amazon.com/fws/


Is this true? I can find nothing on the aws/fws documentation that says Amazon can't ship internationally.

2: Free Shipping The Shopify Wiki also claims that FWS can't do free shipping:


Shipping Methods

    * Standard Shipping
    * Expedited Shipping
    * Priority Shipping 

These must be weight-based rates and can have any non-zero $ value. Specify the weight range that you want to cover for each of the 3 rates. For example, you could have:

    * Standard Shipping 0-50lbs $25
    * Expedited Shipping 0-50lbs $50
    * Priority Shipping 0-50lbs $75 

and also

    * Standard Shipping 50.1-100lbs $55
    * Expedited Shipping 50.1-100lbs $75
    * Priority Shipping 50.1-100lbs $100

I interpret this to mean that I can't offer free shipping, and I must calculate shipping based on weight, but I want to offer free shipping based on how much my customers spend (free shipping for orders over $20). My items are very light, so I'm not concerned about weight.

3: Shipping Options/Carriers Finally, given the previous quote, I am curious about the differences for Standard, Expedited, and Priority Shipping. I assume my customers want to know how quickly each option is, and I want to know how much each option will cost, as well as who the carrier will be. The wiki claims I need to set shipping rates:


Additionally...

Amazon DOES NOT return shipping rates automatically, so values for the rates MUST BE SET in Shopify.

I'm fine with that, but I need to know an estimate for each option to a given location so that I can extend those rates to my customers. This is particularly true for international, as well as priority and expedited shipping options.

Thanks for any feedback on this topic!

-Martin

AWS Support API	"Re: Shopify and Shipping Options (free shipping? International Shipping?)
Hi,

I'll try to address your questions in order.

1. FWS does not currently support international shipments. On-Amazon sales of your FBA inventory can be shipped internationally if you sign up for that service on SellerCentral.

2. FWS will always charge you for shipping based on the FBA Rate Card. FWS has no interaction with your customers aside from sending whatever you ask us. If you want to pass this cost on to your customer (or not), that's up to you.

3. The GetFulfillmentPreview operation will allow you to display, for each order, when we believe each shipping speed will arrive, just like we do on the Amazon.com website.

The shipping speeds vary for each country, and exceptions can apply (which is why we encourage using GetFulfillmentPreview), but, in general, in the United States:
Priority: 1 business day
Expedited: 2 business day
Standard: 3 - 5 business day

I hope this helps."
AWS Support API	"Re: Shopify and Shipping Options (free shipping? International Shipping?)
Thanks Josh,

That helps a lot, and I really appreciate the rapid response. I have some follow up questions:

1: What does FWS do for International Customers? If FWS doesn't support international shipping (please add this feature, and soon!) what will happen if a customer of mine puts in an international shipping address? If I have to handle all international shipments manually, that's OK (for now), but I need to make sure the orders are still going through, and preferably be notified when there is an order that FWS/FBA can't fulfill.

2a: Shipping Rates I will redirect this question to the shopify staff, since I'm confused why the shopify wiki says it must be weight based, and must be a non-zero value. Based on your comment, as long as they're named ""Standard Shipping"" ""Expedited Shipping"" and ""Priority Shipping"" then they will ship as such from Amazon, no matter what I charge my customers.

2b: Shipping Titles I want to add transit time estimates to the shipping options. Can I title my shipping options with the estimated deliver times? Such as ""Priority Shipping: 1 business day"" or must it be ""Priority Shipping"" verbatim? I want to be compliant with Amazon FWS, but also provide my customers with the requisite information.

3: GetFulfillmentPreview I didn't know about this function. Thanks, I'll look into it further.

AWS Support API	"Re: Shopify and Shipping Options (free shipping? International Shipping?)
Hi,

I'll try to answer your questions in order.

1. I don't know what Shopify does. If you were placing the order through SellerCentral, AWS, MWS, or feeds directly, the order would be immediately rejected by our systems. (GetFulfillmentPreview would also reject the order.)

2a. I don't know if the names matter. You'll need to ask Shopify. Our APIs specify the names, but Shopify may handle that integration for you.

2b. Again, there's no reason (from Amazon's perspective) why you can't do this, so long as the names you pass to Amazon are correct. You'll need to ask Shopify.

3. I hope it helps.

AWS Support API	"Re: How to send 'test' data?
Right now, there's no way to flag an order for testing. You can submit purposely invalid orders to make sure that you're integrated correctly. You might use invalid SKUs, invalid ZIP codes, or SKUs for which you have no inventory, for example. These should result in error messages that indicate exactly those problems, rather than any other issues.

If you'd like to make sure everything is working and that the orders actually ship, you may want to send in some ""test"" inventory that can be shipped. This, though, will result in an actual shipment (and fees).

1.) This statement does a good job of expressing our concerns:


We need an automated way to correctly plan, order, and ship product to the Amazon fulfillment centers.  For those who manage their products through Seller Central, the tools exist, but the manual involvement is prohibitive for sellers with a large number of SKUs or a high volume.  Given the sophistication of the remainder of the FBA interface, this seems like an extremely restrictive omission.


2.) We’re looking for software that has the following features;


a.)     In order to accurately forecast “coverage needs” we need to know the average sales of an item on an hourly, Daily, 3 day, Weekly and Monthly basis (or Custom range). It needs to forecast how many units we sent, and recommend how many to send back out to FBA based on item sales for a given range of time.

b.)     It would be helpful to know the total sales (from all sellers) of each ASIN item

c.)     Once we have an accurate way to forecast coverage needs we would need the software to have a “minimum in-stock level.”  If this minimum in stock level is breached we want to receive an email alert

AWS Support API	"Re: Seller Central account vs. AWS account
Hi,

Thanks for trying FWS AWS out. As discussed in the Getting Started Guide (http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/fws/latest/GettingStartedGuide/), you'll need to sign-up for AWS using the same e-mail address and password as the merchant's user-name and password on Seller Central. It may be best to ask your clients to sign up for the AWS account and share the keys with you. There is no way to link accounts between AWS and Seller Central other than this.

The developer accounts in Seller Central are for the Marketplace Web Services (http://developer.amazonservices.com). There is a version of Fulfillment Web Services available for the Marketplace Web Services as well. This MWS version provides the same functionality as the AWS version, and, in the future will provide additional functionality beyond what the AWS version provides.

If you're just getting started, I'd recommend looking at the MWS version, which can handle delegation, which you have already set up.

AWS Support API	"Re: GetInventorySupply Shows Zero Inventory
I have the same experience and got good answer after I used my AWS access keys. Now I got good inventory reply using FWS API. However, when I tried to query for any merchant sku that I can find at www.amazon.com, I got 0 reply. Sorry, I am a newbie to FWS. I believe you guys know this as basic. Anyway, example is I input 001588588010 in Amazon website and I get Lego Batman the Videogame & Pure. Using the FWS API, 

$request = new Amazon_FWSInventory_Model_GetInventorySupplyRequest();
invokeGetInventorySupply($service, $request->withMerchantSKU(""001588588010""));

I got 0.  If I use FBA-001588588010 which is how we name our own SKUs, I got actual inventory count. Does this mean I cannot access info of other vendor inventory? I want to how much stock others also have so I can order from them when my count is 0. Do I need other Amazon web services to accomplish this?"

AWS Support API	"How do you calculate the ""Signature"" value for an Amazon MWS query in VB6
Please help!

I'm trying to submit queries to Amazon's servers to get information on our orders and I know nothing about HMAC, SHA-256, etc. I've managed to get everything set up in a Visual Basic 6 program in order to submit the XML queries, but I get an error message from the Amazon server saying that the ""Signature"" parameter is required. Does anyone know how you can use VB6 to come up with this value and for that matter, what information does Amazon want me to feed into a function in order to come up with the value? 

I've read the Amazon MWS Orders API Section Reference manual, but it seems to make a lot of assumptions about the signature value without spelling it out.

Well first start with the MWS API for guidance.

Docs are here:
https://developer.amazonservices.com/gp/mws/docs.html

Also...... don't know of anything for VB6 but maybe this will help:

https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/mwsportal/doc/en_US/fba/inventory/v20101001/MWSDeveloperGuide.V175102177.pdf

Creating an Amazon MWS Request

Amazon MWS supports query requests for calling web service actions. Query requests are simple HTTP requests, using the GET or POST method with query parameters in the URL or HTTP body, respectively. Amazon MWS requires the use of HTTPS to prevent third party eavesdropping on your communication with Amazon.

Each of the HTTP header lines must be terminated with a carriage return and a line feed. Query requests must contain an Action parameter to indicate the action to be performed. The response is an XML document.

The Amazon MWS Developer Guide goes into detail on how to create a valid HTTP query request. Note that Amazon MWS Scratchpad is a helpful tool for understanding how to create correctly formed HTTP query requests. Amazon MWS Scratchpad automatically generates and displays many of the inputs that are required in a HTTP query request to Amazon MWS. Examining the Amazon MWS responses that Amazon MWS Scratchpad displays for each of your query requests can help you build successful parsing logic.

AWS Support API	"Re: How do you calculate the ""Signature"" value for an Amazon MWS query in VB6
Thank you for the reply. I appreciate the help.

Let me make myself clear.

I already know how to submit queries to Amazon. I'm am 99% of the way there - I have submitted queries and received an error message from the Amazon server stating that the ""Signature"" field is required. 

I have further (since my last post) gathered some informatiion on SHA-256 encryption and I believe that I have the VB code that I need in order to generate the signature.

I can't TEST that my code works because I have no idea what Amazon wants me to use as a ""key"" (I've assumed that this is either my AWS Access Key ID or my Secret Key, but I can't find anywhere in the documentation that tells me what to use) and further, I don't know what the string is that I'm supposed to submit for encryption.

I have already used the MWS Scratchpad (again, before writing my first inquiry) and because of that, I know that the Signature value changes even if you are requesting the same data, so I'm assuming that whatever this elusive string is that I submit for encryption to create the Signature value also changes, presumably because the timestamp is part of the string.

Is that clearer?

Let's pretend that I already have a simple function like:

Signature=(""key"", ""message"")

that did the encryption using SHA-256 and further conversion to Base 64 HMAC (please forgive me if I've worded something strangely - this is new territory for me). I may actually have this now, but I don't have any way to test it BECAUSE...

My problem right now is that I have no idea what to use instead of ""key"" or ""message"" in order to arrive at the Signature. Anyone who could at least tell me WHERE in the many Amazon manuals I can find the section on what these two pieces are would be my friend for life and could have Christmas dinner at my house.

Creating a query request

To create an Amazon MWS query request, you first construct a query string with the query information.

You then sign this query string and include it in the request submission. Note that the query string cannot contain white space or line breaks. The string consists of:

• The HTTP action. This value is most often POST.
• The domain name of the request, such as https://mws.amazonservices.com/. For a list of endpoints for each Amazon marketplace, see the Amazon MWS Endpoints section in this guide. After the endpoint is a forward slash (/), which separates the endpoint from the parameters.
• AWSAccessKeyId (click to get one)—Your Amazon MWS account is identified by your Access Key ID, which Amazon MWS uses to look up your Secret Access Key.
• Action—The action you want to perform on the endpoint, such as the operation
GetFeedSubmissionResult.
• Parameters—Any required and optional request parameters.
• Marketplace—Your Marketplace ID.
• Merchant or SellerId—Your Merchant ID.
• SignatureMethod—The HMAC hash algorithm you are using to calculate your signature, either SHA256 or SHA1.
• SignatureVersion—Which signature version is being used. This is Amazon MWS-specific information that tells Amazon MWS the algorithm you used to form the string that is the basis of the signature. For Amazon MWS, this value is currently SignatureVersion=2.
• Timestamp—Each request must contain the timestamp of the request. Depending on the API function you're using, you can provide an expiration date and time for the request instead of or in addition to the timestamp.
• Version—The version of the API section being called.
The following example is a query string for a GetFeedSubmissionResult request.
Note: The example query string contains line breaks and white space which are shown for ease of reading. The actual query string cannot contain white space or line breaks. All query string examples in this guide are formatted for readability.

Example I will UNformat):
POST
mws.amazonservices.com
/ 
AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAFJPPO5KLY6G4XO7Q&Action=GetFeedSubmissionResult&FeedSubmissionId=4321011681&Marketplace=ATVPDKIKX0DER&Merchant=A3F1LGRLCQDI4D&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2011-02-04T23%3A08%3A19Z&Version=2009-01-01


I have already used the MWS Scratchpad

AWS Support API	"Re: How do you calculate the ""Signature"" value for an Amazon MWS query in VB6
All right, either I'm really dim (the most likely case) or you're not understanding my question. Yes, I've read that part of the manual. As far as I can tell it says NOTHING about how to calculate the signature value. I'm sure it's in there, but it's not in the stuff you posted on this thread and not in anything I've been able to find.

The sample in your reply is much like the one's I've sent to Amazon - it does NOT contain the parameter (which I am assuming is just part of the submission string) &Signature=(whateverthe signature is). When I post queries to Amazon that are similar to the one you listed as an example, it comes back with an error saying that the Signature parameter is required.

I've also found nothing in the Amazon manual that says what is used to create the Signature value. I need to encrypt something with a key value using HMAC-SHA-256 -  what is that string that I need to encrypt and what do I use for the key value?"
AWS Support API	"Re: How do you calculate the ""Signature"" value for an Amazon MWS query in VB6
Maybe I'm getting this now. Is the manual saying that the string to encrypt is:

AWSAccessKeyId=&ltAccess Key Removed>&Action=GetFeedSubmissionResult&FeedSubmissionId=4321011681&Marketplace=ATVPDKIKX0DER&Merchant=A3F1LGRLCQDI4D&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2011-02-04T23%3A08%3A19Z&Version=2009-01-01

in the example?

If so, how do you then send the Signature parameter? Do you add it onto this string? Do you send it instead of this string?"

SSssssssooooooooooo  CCCCcccllllllllloooooosssssseeeee ...LOL

I think some of the confusion is in looking closely at the ScratchPad I don't see where they show you the signed URL. It might be in a different version I have.

Also let me add in here that I'm still not sure about how to do what exactly because I'm not a programmer.

I just know that basics.................

Look at my post with ""Example I will UNformat):""

THAT whole thing is the string to (sign) encrypt......... as noted in the Developer Guide top of page 13.

If you look at the tab in ScratchPad, ""Request Details"", towards the bottom in a blue bar it says ""String to sign"" and has:

POST
mws.amazonservices.com
/ 
AWSAccessKeyId=********&Action=GetFeedSubmissionResult&FeedSubmissionId=4371429174&Merchant=****&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2011-09-12T18%3A57%3A05Z&Version=2009-01-01


So you do something like a ...
HmacSHA256 (
POST
mws.amazonservices.com
/ 
AWSAccessKeyId=********&Action=GetFeedSubmissionResult&FeedSubmissionId=4371429174&Merchant=****&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2011-09-12T18%3A57%3A05Z&Version=2009-01-01)


Then take that signature and do the HTTP post or add it to the URL ... A completed one looks like this and is at the bottom of page 14 / top 15.

https://mws.amazonservices.com/AWSAccessKeyId=********
&Action=GetFeedSubmissionResult
&FeedSubmissionId=**** 
&Merchant=ANZE9ULNDLIJJ
&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256
&SignatureVersion=2
&Timestamp=2011-09-12T18%3A57%3A05Z
&Version=2009-01-01
&Signature=******************
1HTTP/1.1Host:mws.amazonservices.comX-Am
azon-User-Agent:AmazonJavascriptApp/1.0(Language=Javascript)Content-Type:text/xml


Not exactly sure about that 1HTTP/ ... copied from example but the 1 may not go in there.

After that you're on your own.... Base 64? MD5 ??? Not much of a clue.

I've got it working in Java but I got away from the signed request and went to opening/connecting to the WebServiceClient .....not even 100% on how I did that...LOL

Thanks for all the responses, however, I'm not sure they are exactly what I am looking for. I think my explanation wasn't very clear.To simplify, forgot any consideration of my website. I just want to be able buy things off Amazon.com with a script. For example, have a PHP script that accepts a product id and shipping address, and when called, accesses an Amazon.com web service to place an order with instructions to ship to the given address. Ideally, this would be done without human input; however, if necessary, it do something like queue orders and simply have a human rubber stamp it. Don't worry, I know how to code the PHP - I am not asking someone to do the job for me. I just don't know of any Amazon published web service that would allow for that functionality.@mark: It seems to me that Corporate accounts still require a human to physically place the order.@Joel: I initially looked at the Associate's program, but I could only find product advertising tools there. Everything dealt with referrals and links back to Amazon.com.

AWS Support API	"Re: Using FWS to buy any Amazon item?
I have a similar requirment from my client, who wants a semi ""secret santa"" application where users can buy an amazon item for another user.

the problem with the associate program is that it requires the user to go through the entire purchase, including filling out the shipping adress, which for privacy reasons, our users do not want to be publicly available.(although we(the host) internally have the addresses for each user)

A function where my company can trigger a purchase of a specific amazon item with a shipping adress  is all we really need, but I am afraid this does not exist. Can FWS do this?

I suppose we could let the user simply choose an item(but not buy it).  An we could manually make the purchase for them, but this has obvious scalablitly issues, and we would not be getting the associate percentage..

Has anyone else solved the bug in the FBA Outbound API - PHP sample code? When creating a ""CreateFulfillmentOrder"" the documentation is lacking quite a bit on how to add items. Fumbling around I created the following process to add and item:

=== PHP code ===
// collect item values
$order_item_query 		= ""SELECT * FROM order_details WHERE order_id ='"".$receipt_number.""'"";
$order_item_result 	= $db -> Execute($order_item_query)

	$afn_item-> setSellerSKU($order_item_row);

The problem is when it is called I found there is a mistake / error / bug in the sample code. The sample 'Client.php' file calls ""$itemscreateFulfillmentOrderRequest->getmember()"" but the getmember() function does not exist.

I replaced:
$itemscreateFulfillmentOrderRequest = $request->getItems();
foreach ($itemscreateFulfillmentOrderRequest->getmember() as $memberitemsIndex => $memberitems) {

with the following:
foreach ($request->getItems() as $memberitemsIndex => $memberitems) {
                if ($memberitems->isSetSellerSKU()) {

... but now I get an error from the server saying:
Caught Exception: The request must contain the parameter Items.

Yet, here http://www.amazon.com/gp/seller-account/mm-product-page.html?topic=200274770 it clearly shows that FBA is enabled as an individual seller and that there is no monthly fee at all. Only a free per sell. 

Why the contradiction? Can I use FBA selling maybe 5-10 items a month and not LOSE money; getting 25$ in sales of 2$ bath powder packets that I have no use for, then getting charged 40$?

I LOVE FBA; nothing beats throwing a bunch of stuff you bought and didn't need into a box and having Amazon sell it for you, but I definitely don't sell anywhere near the 40 items a month that Amazon recommends I be selling in order to be a ""pro merchant"" and be charged $39.99, monthly.

AWS Support API	"Re: GetInventorySupply - identify if fulfilled by Merchant or FBA
Josh,

Thank-you!

Here is the issue.

When the item goes to zero on FBA which I detect with GetInventorySupply we then remove the item
from FBA to be fulfilled by merchant by uploading the item data using AMTU.

However when we want to send new stock to FBA we need to update the inventory listing (done via
seller central) for the shipping labels and this changes the fulfillment to FBA even though the stock isn't there.

Therefore after we ship I want to put it back to being fulfilled by merchant till the 
inventory arrives.

What I noticed with GetInventorySupply is that it doesn't seem to differentiate btw an item 
which is fulfilled by Merchant and FBA (Both show zero quantity).

Thats why I""m looking for some data element which will indicate that its FBA so I can switch it back to Merchant.

AWS Support API	"Re: Getting Item Information
You can't get all the information you request from FWS, but you can get a lot of it.If you set the ResponseGroup of your Inventory FWS call to ""Detailed"", as described in the WSDL (https://fba-inventory.amazonaws.com/doc/2009-07-31/AmazonFBAInventory.wsdl), this will give you the SupplyDetail information, which differentiates among sellable, unsellable, and encumbered AFN inventory, for example.To find out how much of anything was shipped by AFN over a time range, I'd suggest using the Amazon Fulfilled Shipments Report, which can be downloaded using MWS (https://mws.amazon.com/. The report you're most likely interested in is described at http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/thread.jspa?threadID=44625&tstart=68.)I'm afraid I don't know much about what reporting options are available for MFN items, but I believe that information should be available through MWS.Information about inbound FBA shipments can mostly be found in the Inbound FWS. I think the information you're looking for will mostly be found in the ListInboundShipments and the ListInboundShipmentItems operations.At the moment, AFN listing issues are only reported on SellerCentral on the Inventory Amazon Fulfills page."

3dcart store with CBA and FBA. CBA works and communicates perfectly. FBA not at all. I have repeatedly checked my access keys and all seems to be well. I am using my AWS keys in the ""Amazon FBA"" Plugin within 3dCart. 

I get the message: ""The AWS Access Key Id needs a subscription for the service."" in the notes for any order. I am assuming that means there is some sort of communication, and it's just a config problem. I believe that I have tried all of the methods seen in the forums including setting us SES but to no avail. 

Does anyone have any insight? I am losing my mind and my client is losing his patience.

BTW, I also checked the billing with AWS. All is and has been good. I have emailed and spoken on the phone with several reps (free customer service obviously) and they all say our account is in fine shape and have no idea what that message could mean. Amazon blames 3d cart and 3d cart blames Amazon. I'm sure it's something that I am overlooking but I am obviously beyond helping myself at this point.

If you are trying to use Amazon Fulfillment Web Service (FWS), then I recommend ensuring that you are subscribed to the service by going here and clicking ""Sign up for Amazon FWS"":

http://aws.amazon.com/fws/

Hi - If you grab the current version of the FWS Outbound WSDL, you'll see a new operation there called ""GetFulfillmentPreview"", which will provide available shipping speeds, estimated fulfillment fees, ship and delivery date estimates, etc., given a ship-to address and list of items. It doesn't actually create an order, or reserve any inventory, but gives a good indication of what would happen to the order if it were submitted in the next few minutes. It's intended for the kind of use-case you describe: supporting checkout pages, etc.Proper documentation is in the works, but the WSDL is reasonably well-documented.

You must use a different endpoint to talk to the Outbound Service. To receive the endpoint in Europe, please contact fba-eu@amazon.lu.

However, please note that we recommend that all merchants, especially outside the United States, integrate with the Marketplace Web Services that offer additional functionality and are easier to sign up for. You can see the documentation for that at developer.amazonservices.de.

AWS Support API	"Re: Can Amazon FWS be integrated with Ebay, PayPal or ProStores?
I'm certain that we could integrate Ebay with FBA. (ie Grab your eBay orders and submit them to FBA for fullfillment, and then grab the shipping/tracking data from FBA and use that information to update eBay directly so that buyers who look for shipping status in MyEbay will see the latest tracking info.

If SolidCommerce has an API for retrieving orders and submitting shipping/tracking data, we could use that API to integrate SolidCommerce with FBA. If SolidCommerce has no such API, but they have the capability to export orders via CSV data files and import shipping/tracking data via CSV data files, then we could make something like that work as well.

Call or email anytime.. I'd be happy to brainstorm with you what might be your best approach overall.

We are looking to solve order/inventory/tracking management across multiple marketplaces- our primary warehouse being FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon).
1ST PIECE-

We receive 10 pcs to FBA, of which 10 are made available to sell on the amazon marketplace automatically.  We also sell that same sku on eBay and have that sku listed on ebay at 10 pcs.  In real time (or as close to it) as items sell on either marketplace we are looking for a solution that would adjust the active quantity of the sku.

Amazon listing:
Sony Playstation video game package-initial qty 10
3 sell.

Ebay listing:
Sony Playstation PS3 video game package brand new in box- initial qty 10
2 sell.

Ending qty: 5 sitting in amazon.  System needs to update that ebay listing has only 5 pieces, and same for amazon.

Update tracking from FBA to ebay order or other marketplaces.

3rd PIECE-
Import orders into quickbooks"

Hi N. Corporation,

I'm sorry to hear about the trouble you've encountered.  It is nice of you to include the complete error message you received.  That type of detailed information can greatly assist in most troubleshooting situations.

Based on the error message, it simply sounds like you need to subscribe to the ""MerchantQueryService"".

I can confirm that there is no such service provided by AWS.  All services of AWS are listed here:

http://aws.amazon.com/products/

That being said, I tried to see if I could find more information about that service so I could at least point you in the right direction.  The only remotely helpful clue I could find was in this documentation covering transitioning from AIM to MWS (both of which are services provided by ""Amazon Services"", not AWS):

https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/02/mwsportal/doc/bde/AIM_to_Amazon_MWS_Migration_Guide._V180902185_.pdf


It's mentioned being used for Order Fulfillment and Canceling Orders which is discussed on pages 9 and 10 of the PDF.  Since the context is one where the reader would be transitioning to using MWS, my best guess is that the MWS team many know about the ""MerchantQueryService"" and may be able to assist you.  With that in mind, you may want to try posting your question in the MWS forums for assistance:

http://www.amazonsellercommunity.com/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=43

I'm sorry I can't provide more specific guidance with the MerchantQueryService.

Hi,

The request you provided was a ""Marketplace Web Service"" Fulfillment API request, not an ""Amazon Web Services"" Fulfillment API request. I know the difference seems minor, but this forum is about the AWS version of the APIs. The newer, MWS version is supported at http://www.amazonsellercommunity.com/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=43. Maybe they can help you?

One thing I notice that might be relevant is that it looks like your timestamp is to greater than a second's precision. Historically, for the AWS version, those have been rejected as not conforming to the standard format AWS uses. Can you try with a timestamp only to 1 second's precision?

This is Raja Ramadass from Monsoon and we are one of the integarators of amazon marketplace services. Few of our customers have reported that while sending their product to FBA through shipment, they are getting missing dimensions error from FWS API. 
Please see below for an example. 
ERROR Monsoon.Core.FBA.FBAProvider - Exception getting ShipmentPreview for [sku: 3955, quantity: 1]. Amazon.FWSInbound.AmazonFWSInboundException: Value Invalid parameter for parameter UnknownSku is invalid. Reason: Invalid shipment items. InvalidItems[ (skuType={Enum::MSKU}, sku=3955, reason=MISSING_DIMENSIONS)]. 
at Amazon.FWSInbound.AmazonFWSInboundClient.Invoke[T](IDictionary`2 parameters) 

We recommend our sellers to provide dimensions data for the product on the amazon.com site when they encounter this error and then try adding the item to the shipment. Our understanding is that product data such as item dimensions are associated to the asin /product and not to the sku. However based on our customer reports and our testing, we have found that the dimensions are only stored 
at the sku level and not at the product level. We were able to prove our theory with the following test 


We have attempted to send the item with asin B0023QXCG8 to amazon fulfilment center by creating a shipment through the FWS call 
Missing dimensions error was thrown by the GetShipmentPreview call. 
We have added dimensions information by creating a listing with sku jewel001_loc and attempted to add that item to a shipment and the operation was successful 
When we tried to send another item (same asin asin B0023QXCG8 ) with a different sku say jewel001_usf, we could not add that to a shipment and it failed with missing dimensions error 
We deleted the previously created listing (sku jewel001_loc ) and added another listing for the sku jewel001_usf and provided dimensions information for that sku 
After this, we were able to add the item with sku jewel001_usf to the shipment successfully 


Please let us know whether this is a bug or an expected behavior and based on that we can make appropriate changes to FBA shipment creation process in our product.

AWS Support API	"Regarding FBA revenue calculator for big inventory
Hi,

Iam a seller with growing FBA inventory. Iam not sure this is correct forum. I have tried to find correct department after best technical abilities but this is really not my area of expertise and I hope some one could direct me to correct department or atleast in a good direction.

I have already contacted amazon seller support with below questions but yet not recieved anything helpful. 

To my question then. For bigger sellers who list alot of SKUs, what is best practice for finding out exact fba fee for each asin? Going trough fba calculator one by one is very tedious and time consuming for big inventories (1000+ SKUs). Variable fees like comission varies from 6-15% depending on category and our products are scattered over many categories. Weight based fees and 30 day storage are also variable, thus makes it impossible to just setup an equation in excel. Finding out our breakeven price after FBA fees for each asin is critical for us to decide minimum selling price or in deciding our margin inpact.

If we have our cost price in csv file for every asin, is it possible to fetch exact fees for all asins in the file?

Please advice ASAP. This is a very big issue for us.

Best regards"
AWS Support API	"Re: Regarding FBA revenue calculator for big inventory
I'm afraid we don't currently offer anything like that to see what you would be charged. You would need to do the calculations yourself.

We were able to get the FNSKU properly. But calling PutInboundShipmentItems to add the item to shipment resulted in this error:

AWS Support API	"MWS migration workflow questions
Hi
I started looking over the FWS to MWS migration documents and am a bit alarmed at some of the workflow changes.  

Our primary workflow is labeling our items (one by one from your perspective) and then creating an inbound shipment at a later point in time.  Our stations to sticker items and create inbound shipments are completely different stations in the warehouse and sometimes in completely different physical locations.  So it is not possible for us to combine these two steps.  I'll also add that we are dealing with lots of unique items that each get their own fnsku (~500k). It doesn't seem right to be creating a new shipment each time we need to register an fnsku. But anyhow, there doesn't seem to be any other option with the new API, so I'm trying to understand the new workflow around registering fnskus and creating inbound shipments.  

1. If this is a new item (or its condition has changed), I need to call CreateInboundShipmentPlan for the single item, passing over merchant sku, condition, and asin.  
2. CreateInboundShipmentPlan returns an fnsku which we label the item with and store in our database.  And now I need to store DestinationFulfillmentCenterId and ShipmentId for each item in our database too?

And now this is where I'm lost.  Let's say we have a pile of items labeled with fnskus ready to be shipped (also consider many fnskus that may have been registered with the old API), what do I need to do in order to create a new inbound shipment for them?  I don't really understand the workflow in your guide.   Is there anyway just to create a brand new shipment for the items and not have to deal with all this complexity around looking at existing inbound shipments and the destination for each item, etc?

Thanks,
Chris"

AWS Support API	"Shopify and Shipping Options (free shipping? International Shipping?)
Hi,

I'm working on integrating my Shopify ecommerce store with my Amazon account. I currently have stock in inventory at an Amazon warehouse.

I was looking at the Shopify Wiki on Amazon FWS/FBA:  http://wiki.shopify.com/Help:Preferences#Fulfillment_by_Amazon

I have three questions from this:

1: International Shipping A significant percentage of my customers are International. The Shopify Wiki claims FWS can't do international shipping:


Note: Only Amazon USA is supported. Amazon only ships within the USA.

Items configured to use Amazon Fulfillment can ONLY be shipped to US customers via Amazon. See here: http://aws.amazon.com/fws/


Is this true? I can find nothing on the aws/fws documentation that says Amazon can't ship internationally.

2: Free Shipping The Shopify Wiki also claims that FWS can't do free shipping:


Shipping Methods

    * Standard Shipping
    * Expedited Shipping
    * Priority Shipping 

These must be weight-based rates and can have any non-zero $ value. Specify the weight range that you want to cover for each of the 3 rates. For example, you could have:

    * Standard Shipping 0-50lbs $25
    * Expedited Shipping 0-50lbs $50
    * Priority Shipping 0-50lbs $75 

and also

    * Standard Shipping 50.1-100lbs $55
    * Expedited Shipping 50.1-100lbs $75
    * Priority Shipping 50.1-100lbs $100

I interpret this to mean that I can't offer free shipping, and I must calculate shipping based on weight, but I want to offer free shipping based on how much my customers spend (free shipping for orders over $20). My items are very light, so I'm not concerned about weight.

3: Shipping Options/Carriers Finally, given the previous quote, I am curious about the differences for Standard, Expedited, and Priority Shipping. I assume my customers want to know how quickly each option is, and I want to know how much each option will cost, as well as who the carrier will be. The wiki claims I need to set shipping rates:


Additionally...

Amazon DOES NOT return shipping rates automatically, so values for the rates MUST BE SET in Shopify.

I'm fine with that, but I need to know an estimate for each option to a given location so that I can extend those rates to my customers. This is particularly true for international, as well as priority and expedited shipping options.

Thanks for any feedback on this topic!

AWS Support API	"Re: Shopify and Shipping Options (free shipping? International Shipping?)
Hi,

I'll try to address your questions in order.

1. FWS does not currently support international shipments. On-Amazon sales of your FBA inventory can be shipped internationally if you sign up for that service on SellerCentral.

2. FWS will always charge you for shipping based on the FBA Rate Card. FWS has no interaction with your customers aside from sending whatever you ask us. If you want to pass this cost on to your customer (or not), that's up to you.

3. The GetFulfillmentPreview operation will allow you to display, for each order, when we believe each shipping speed will arrive, just like we do on the Amazon.com website.

The shipping speeds vary for each country, and exceptions can apply (which is why we encourage using GetFulfillmentPreview), but, in general, in the United States:
Priority: 1 business day
Expedited: 2 business day
Standard: 3 - 5 business day

I hope this helps."
AWS Support API	"Re: Shopify and Shipping Options (free shipping? International Shipping?)
Thanks Josh,

That helps a lot, and I really appreciate the rapid response. I have some follow up questions:

1: What does FWS do for International Customers? If FWS doesn't support international shipping (please add this feature, and soon!) what will happen if a customer of mine puts in an international shipping address? If I have to handle all international shipments manually, that's OK (for now), but I need to make sure the orders are still going through, and preferably be notified when there is an order that FWS/FBA can't fulfill.

2a: Shipping Rates I will redirect this question to the shopify staff, since I'm confused why the shopify wiki says it must be weight based, and must be a non-zero value. Based on your comment, as long as they're named ""Standard Shipping"" ""Expedited Shipping"" and ""Priority Shipping"" then they will ship as such from Amazon, no matter what I charge my customers.

2b: Shipping Titles I want to add transit time estimates to the shipping options. Can I title my shipping options with the estimated deliver times?

Hi,

I'll try to answer your questions in order.

1. I don't know what Shopify does. If you were placing the order through SellerCentral, AWS, MWS, or feeds directly, the order would be immediately rejected by our systems. (GetFulfillmentPreview would also reject the order.)

2a. I don't know if the names matter. You'll need to ask Shopify. Our APIs specify the names, but Shopify may handle that integration for you.

2b. Again, there's no reason (from Amazon's perspective) why you can't do this, so long as the names you pass to Amazon are correct. You'll need to ask Shopify.

AWS Support API	"Re: How to send 'test' data?
Right now, there's no way to flag an order for testing. You can submit purposely invalid orders to make sure that you're integrated correctly. You might use invalid SKUs, invalid ZIP codes, or SKUs for which you have no inventory, for example. These should result in error messages that indicate exactly those problems, rather than any other issues.

If you'd like to make sure everything is working and that the orders actually ship, you may want to send in some ""test"" inventory that can be shipped. This, though, will result in an actual shipment (and fees).

1.) This statement does a good job of expressing our concerns:


We need an automated way to correctly plan, order, and ship product to the Amazon fulfillment centers.

2.) We’re looking for software that has the following features;


a.)     In order to accurately forecast “coverage needs” we need to know the average sales of an item on an hourly, Daily, 3 day, Weekly and Monthly basis (or Custom range). It needs to forecast how many units we sent, and recommend how many to send back out to FBA based on item sales for a given range of time.

b.)     It would be helpful to know the total sales (from all sellers) of each ASIN item

c.)     Once we have an accurate way to forecast coverage needs we would need the software to have a “minimum in-stock level.”  If this minimum in stock level is breached we want to receive an email alert

AWS Support API	"Re: Seller Central account vs. AWS account
Hi,

Thanks for trying FWS AWS out. As discussed in the Getting Started Guide (http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/fws/latest/GettingStartedGuide/), you'll need to sign-up for AWS using the same e-mail address and password as the merchant's user-name and password on Seller Central. It may be best to ask your clients to sign up for the AWS account and share the keys with you. There is no way to link accounts between AWS and Seller Central other than this.

The developer accounts in Seller Central are for the Marketplace Web Services (http://developer.amazonservices.com). There is a version of Fulfillment Web Services available for the Marketplace Web Services as well. This MWS version provides the same functionality as the AWS version, and, in the future will provide additional functionality beyond what the AWS version provides.

AWS Support API	"other merchant inventory with FWS

It seems that the Access Key you are using is not tied to any merchant account for Selling on Amazon. Thus, we are replying with a default response that you do not have any inventory, no matter what SKU you ask about.

Please remember that, when using the Fulfillment Web Services, your AWS developer account and your Selling on Amazon account must have the same e-mail address and password. Further, in order to use the Fulfillment Web Services, you must also be registered for Fulfillment by Amazon."

I have the same experience and got good answer after I used my AWS access keys. Now I got good inventory reply using FWS API. However, when I tried to query for any merchant sku that I can find at www.amazon.com, I got 0 reply. Sorry, I am a newbie to FWS. I believe you guys know this as basic.

$request = new Amazon_FWSInventory_Model_GetInventorySupplyRequest();
invokeGetInventorySupply($service, $request->withMerchantSKU(""001588588010""));

I got 0.  If I use FBA-001588588010 which is how we name our own SKUs, I got actual inventory count. Does this mean I cannot access info of other vendor inventory?

AWS Support API	"Identifying the source of excessive AWS requests in RequestLimitExceeded
Hi,

I've started to hit `RequestLimitExceeded` when using `awscli` and various languages. It would be really useful to have a way to trace the source of the excessive number of requests - my system makes heavy use of the various APIs, including:
 * service discovery - using `describe-instances`
 * monitoring - using `cloudwatch` stats to identify problems with e.g. 
 * devops tools - e.g. performing system upgrades

It's really difficult to identify the main culprits, as far as I can see AWS provides zero tooling to support this. It would be useful to be able to see things like
 * number of calls broken down by service
 * number of calls broken down by source IP address

Has anyone found a way to narrow the search down in this instance?

We have always been on a ""Basic"" support plan, but today have realized that we were no longer able to create ""Technical"" cases at all without upgrading to at least a ""Developer"" plan.

As recently as June 2017, we were able to file technical support cases related to AWS infrastructure issues. Can someone comment -- was there a change made to AWS recently to completely disallow any technical support cases from being filed without a plan?

Separately -- we just upgraded to a ""Developer"" support plan to regain the access to file technical cases, but how do we choose the ""Primary contact"" who is able to file cases? The plan indicates ""One primary contact may open an unlimited number of cases"". How does AWS know who that person is?

Keep in mind that I am also testing this through a Woozone Wordpress plug in and it should be having even more clicks than 189 + 769 + Woozone clicks.

One guy on YouTube showed sales through Amazon links of up to $22,000 in a month. So I figure if it keeps increasing exponentially as it has been then the sales will likely roll in.

AWS Support API	"Error connecting to AWS services, kCFURLErrorCannotFindHost = -1003
We have been working on an iOS project which makes use of the official AWS SDK for iOS (version 2.017) and Cognito Sync SDK for iOS (version 1.0.8). Both of these have been installed using the dependency management system CocoaPods.

Our project interacts with the Cognito and SQS services. All iOS devices post messages to the same queue (outbound queue). The individual iOS device will then read from a specified queue only for that iOS device (inbound queue #1, #2, #3...).

We have encountered the error kCFURLErrorCannotFindHost (code -1003) from time to time while reading the inbound queues. We have not yet found the root of this issue, so we are not able to systematically recreate it. Sometimes it happens on 3G, sometimes on WiFi, other times there can go days before it reoccurs.
*UPDATE: The error seems to occur mainly over 3G when changing location. So it happens whenever the app tries to connect to the server again through a new 3G antenna. *

This error has occurred both when connecting to Cognito and to the SQS service. A screenshot of the error can be seen in the attached file when trying to connect to the SQS.

When the error occurs, then it will continue to happen for around 5-10 minutes before it disappears. No changes are done to the code and the location of the device is not changed. It seems to disappear naturally after this timeframe.

We have a theory that the error is connected to the NSURLConnection class. We will continue to try and pinpoint the root of the error by examining the AWS SDK. Our current lead is focusing on the “keepalive” parameter.

It is important to notice, this error does not seem to be related to only the AWS Cloud. We have New Relic implemented for the same iOS project which experiences the same error.
We are looking for a way to recover from this error and thought that it should be done from the AWS SDK. 
Would you have some advice for resetting the NSURLConnection when this error occurs? We will happy to try your suggestions by making changes to the AWS SDK.

Because you have your code in the wrong order. The `use` statement should be first in your code, after any namespace declarations.

Secondly, you instantiate $s3, then you overwrite it with `$s3 = S3Client::factory();`. Basically, you instantiate it twice — once correctly, once incorrectly."

The following snippet shows how to set the endpoint to the US West (Oregon) region (us-west-2) in the low-level API.

Hello,

This should be an easy one, I'm probably missing something basic. I'm new to this.

Have a C# console module connecting to S3 using credentials from profile in SDK store on VS2010. From my machine within VS2010 the code executes with no problems and throws the expected output.

On any other machine I've transferred the exe to, it throws the error below. My  expectation/understanding is that by specifying a profile in app.config and having the same profile in the SDK store, on compilation the credentials will be embedded and therefore I do not need to provide any when running on another machine. Is that true?

Following is the complete error:

What am I missing? looks like the credentials are not embedding. Or, are the creds encrypted based on each user and why it can't decrypt them perhaps? but if that's true it'd be a weird option to give developers if they can't use it on a different account, so I hope that's not the case.

Additional Info:

1) I'm running VS2010 on a domain account, where it works.
2) The exe errors on an EC2 instance where the account is different, it's just a local user account with admin access.
3) My exe.config file is in the same folder as the exe.
4) App.Config has Build action set to ""content"".

I just updated an older project with the latest aws-java-sdk jar (1.9.32).

After more considerable digging, I found a post that claims the aws java tools require depend on Apache Commons client, logging and codec projects. NOWHERE IN THE ACTUAL DOCUMENTATION FOR THE LIBRARY IS THIS CALLED OUT, not even in the step-by-step instructions given for testing it. I can't believe this oversight.

In any case, I do have these jars in my project, at least older versions of them. Maybe too old, but who knows, because there is again NO DOCUMENTATION POINTING OUT WHICH VERSIONS I NEED.

Also, the Apache ""Client"" jar is DEPRECATED AND NO LONGER SUPPORTED and has been replaced by something else.

I would appreciate it if someone, anyone, could please tell me exactly what I need to make this work.

I would REALLY appreciated it if the Amazon people would just release a version of this jar that doesn't depend on a convoluted mess of third-party open source jars. Amazon is a huge company with thousands of developers. I can't believe that they haven't got the resources to have some guy sit for a couple of days and write their own HTTP client code.

Hey Frank, sorry for the slow response.  For specific questions about the AWS SDK for Java, you can get faster responses in the SDK's forum:

Sorry to hear you're having problems with the dependencies.  There are only a few required third-party dependencies, but managing any dependencies in an application can often be challenging.  I'd strongly recommend checking out Maven for your project.  It provides automatic management of your dependencies and can be a great help to prevent any version conflicts or missing dependencies.

AWS Support API	"How to do API Versioning?
Hi,

I have to do API versioning. I am using REST and Dynamo DB. I am confused how to implement in the versioning in Source code. 

If my API looks like this : http://localhost:8080/example.com/v2/hello
Then In my source code how to implement this?
Like :
If(version == 1) {//Do Version 1 Source Code}
else If(version == 2) {//Do Version 2 Source Code}
else If(version == 3) {//Do Version 3 Source Code} ……….. 
If I did like this, Then why we are going for Versioning. We can implement Manually Right? And also If I have to add some 100 versions, then the code looks uglier.
I get confused how to implement in Source Code. Please Clarify my doubt."
AWS Support API	"SalesRank in Bestseller List
Hi,

I'm trying to geht the best selling TVs via the api.
When i use following parameters, i get the same results as i can see on the Amazon Webpage:(http://www.amazon.de/gp/bestsellers/ce-de/1197292/ref=zg_bs_nav_ce_1_ce)

'Operation' => 'BrowseNodeLookup',
//TV BrowsenodeId:
'BrowseNodeId' => '1197292', 
'ResponseGroup' => 'TopSellers'

But I wonder why i dont get the same results when i use the SearchItem Option with following parametes:

'Operation' => 'ItemSearch',
'SearchIndex' => 'Electronics',
'BrowseNode' => '1197292',
'Sort' => 'salesrank',
'ResponseGroup' => 'SalesRank'

When i use this query, 8 or 9 out of the 10 returned TVs arent among the bestsellers.
Furthermore I wonder why the SalesRank of the TVs are not ordered from low to high values.
When i use other Sort-parametes like price, the api seems to return correct items (the 10 cheapest in the TV BrowseNode Section)
I would have expected, that the 2nd query delivers the same results as the first one, because when i check the SalesRank of the bestselling TVs, they seem to increase. Also there are Items in the first query which are not listed in the 2nd query although they have a better SalesRank than some Itmes which are listed in the 2nd query.

AWS Support API	"s3 signedUrl PUT failing when generated on EC2, but runs correctly locally
Hello,

I'm having a perplexing problem. I am using a server side generated (nodejs sdk) signedUrl for a putObject request to upload an image directly from the users browser to S3. Everything functions perfectly when I run the application from my local development workstation. However, when I deploy the exact same code to an EC2 instance, the PUT request is failing with an AccessDenied error. I thought at first it could be due to a UTC vs. Local time issue but I have ruled that out. Could it have something to do with whether or not the originating request is coming from localhost vs my domain name? I have CORS configured on the bucket to allow wildcard origins for now, so it doesn't seem to be a CORS issue.

Has anyone ever experienced this?

Any suggestions are greatly appreciated!

AWS Support API	"Re: KEY RSA
Hi there,

From what I can tell, you're having a bit of issue creating an CSR file, that you can use to create an SSL Certificate.
Is that correct?
If you are using the OpenSSL Software to generate these certificates, you will need to supply your domain name within the ""Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:"" option.

So for example, if you wanted to create an SSL Certificate valid for www.example.com, you would enter:

Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []: www.example.com.

I hope this helps,

            else {
                entry.pipe(fstream.Writer({ 'path': '/tmp/mytest/' + filename })); /* Give the output file name */
            }
        }
    });

At the location where the code breaks I've inspected, the object self.body is a readable stream, and it does not have a read() member. The above code demonstrates the problem. Switching the condition to 0 writes the files locally instead of to S3, which works.

I'm pretty new with this stuff, am I making a simple error misusing the api call, or is there a problem in the call? I could write the string out, but for performance reasons would rather stream the data.

Thanks


I think the issue here is with the tar module I'm using or with fstreams. tar.Parse() is built on fstream rather than stream, and when I examine the line with the error on it self.body is a readable fstream, but not a stream.Readable because it has no read() method. I submitted a bug report to fstream (since I think it should be a stream), I will update with the result when I hear anything.

In the meantime, comments that make this clearer to me are still welcome.

I have created an IAM user with administrator permissions and cannot seem to place objects into any of my S3 buckets, yet the policy simulator clearly articulate that I should in fact have full access to all my buckets. When using the AWS CLI, I get the following message:

AWS Support API	"Ip address blocked from accesing server
Good day

We're currently having some issues with our aws-base sited (a php-based website running on an ec2 with centos 7). Apparently, the ip address of our client has been blocked and he can't access the site - but everyone else can, apparently. Both the developers and the rest of our staff can access the site without issue, which leads me to think out client's ip has been blacklisted.

What can we do to solve this issue?

Thanks in advance"

Good Day, 

Thank you for posting this thread. 

I would like you to share the IP address and the URL that its failing to access (and related AWS Resource i.e.: instance ID) for further analysis. 

Looking forward to your response.

AWS Support API	"Signing API POST request with Javascript / ""Host"" header not allowed by JS
What I'm trying to do: Ultimately: I want to populate an AWS Kinesis stream from a browser extension (Safari, Chrome). I need to send the request to AWS using a signing process (v4); this involves setting headers and encrypting them (on a distant server with the aws secret key) to finally join those to the request.

Amazon requests the header ""Host"" to be explicitly defined… However Javascript strictly disallow setting it (and a bunch of others, for good reasons)

I must be missing something—how can I do this?

sources:  http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4-signed-request-examples.html  - the example is in Python but it shows how server-side  the use of the Host header is intended

notes: the example's comments describing the GET and query string mention the ""Host"": it must exist as a header in the request

also: Using a similar setup, I managed to have a file uploaded from the client directly to an S3 bucket–the autorisation process is slightly different (no requirement for 'Host')."
AWS Support API	"Re: Signing API POST request with Javascript / ""Host"" header not allowed by JS
HOST is apparently defined by the browser itself—so there was no need to set it: the error disappeared once i stopped setting it. Details http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28326752/aws-api-signed-post-request-with-javascript"

I  have found  the answer. 
To get all variations(configurations) of a configurable product we need  to use,

Hi Hina,

I think there was some confusion. This is the Amazon Web Services forums and deals with EC2 compute, storage and other services. It looks like your question was related to Amazon Retail. I think maybe one of forums below might be a better fit for your question for next time.

AWS Support API	"EC2-import-instance Linux VM with LVM over multiple disks?
Im trying to import a Linux VM which was exported over vSphere to EC2 (Export OVF Template).

The format of the vm is vmdk. The CLI to communicate with the API is installed. 

An import test with a VM with just one disk and LVM worked perfectly fine with following command:
ec2-import-instance <vm_name>  -f VMDK -t m3.large -a x86_64 -b <bucket> -o <ACCESS_KEY> -w <SECRET_KEY> -p Linux --subnet <SUBNET>

However, importing the second VM which has two disks isn't working. First of all the export via vSphere leads to two disk files -> vmname.disk1 and vmname.disk2 (aswell as the .mf and the .ova file)

ec2-describe-conversion-tasks leads to the attached picture
In my try I've choosen to upload the first disk file, since it contains the /boot sector. The upload finishes sucessfully but during the conversion it fails with the error message ""ClientError: Unsupported: Incomplete root disk. No /etc directory found InstanceID <InstanceID>"", the vm is automatically deleted from EC2 afterwards.

So my question is: Is this construct (LVM over multiple disks mapped on /root) supported? -> Is there a way to upload both disk files at the same time, so the vm will find the /etc directory?

Thanks for any advice

AWS Support API	"Re: EC2-import-instance Linux VM with LVM over multiple disks?
I'm having this exact problem.  I'm assuming that I'll have to move /boot over to the disk containing the OS (and install grub on that disks MBR).  This is a pain because I think only grub2 supports booting from LVM partitions?"
AWS Support API	"Re: EC2-import-instance Linux VM with LVM over multiple disks?
I have the exact problem as well. 
From : http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/VMImportPrerequisites.html
Section called ""requirments and limitations"" 7th bullet
Make sure your VM only uses a single disk. Importing a VM with more than one disk is not supported. For Linux VMs, /boot and / can be located in different partitions, but they need to be on the same disk.

We have /boot and / on separate disks and want to keep it that way so / can be encrypted.

I'd like to see if we could tackle the first problem of importing with separate /boot and / disks first though. Any help would be appreciated."
