Amazon RDS Database Preview Environment	"What is meant that database instances are deleted after 60 days?
I'm building an RDS Postgres 11 DB for eventual delivery to a client and am comfortable working within the preview environment because of the benefits of Postgres 11 and the delivery not being immediate.

I'm currently testing the database to monitor performance on several queries.  I'm just confused by the message that ""database instances are automatically deleted after 60 days.""

Amazon RDS Database Preview Environment	"Re: When is Postgres 11 slated for release on RDS?
AWS generally won't publicly give date guidance, but historically they wait for the first minor release after GA and then it takes from a couple of weeks to a couple of months to be made available on RDS.  The reason for not releasing the initial GA of a major release into production is that generally one or more very serious production-impacting bugs is found in that major release and fixed in the first minor release.

I don't know if the existence of the Preview Environment will change the RDS' teams overall approach.  On the one hand it reduces pressure to make the new major release available in the production environment because in the first few months most demand is for development use of the new release.  On the other hand, it increases the number of customers like you who have been doing development on beta releases and are ready to go into production as soon as the major release goes GA.  And on the third (for you scifi fans) hand, the Preview Environment gives the RDS team a far greater confidence level on the quality of the GA version and on RDS' readiness to support it.  In other words, both RDS and customer readiness to support the major release GA is much higher than in the past.  But giving the major release some bake time before putting it into production is probably still the better course of action.

Amazon RDS Database Preview Environment	"Posgres 11 GA availability?
I was wondering if anyone could provide any guidance as to when Postgres 11 in RDS is anticipated to reach general availability? I'm not looking for a specific date but perhaps an order of magnitude estimate based on historical release times? I'm trying to do some architectural planning and some of the items in our backlog would be greatly simplified with features available in pg 11."
Amazon RDS Database Preview Environment	"Re: Posgres 11 GA availability?
Historically RDS waits for the first minor release after a major release to make the release available for production.  The main reason is that the initial GA for a a major release will have serious bugs that RDS would rather not release into production.  Once that first minor release is available it takes RDS from a couple of weeks to a couple of months to make it available.  I don’t know if the existence of the preview environment will alter that schedule, but most likely not.

11.1 was released on 11/8, and normally I’d expect RDS to be making it available about now.  Re:Invent may be messing with that schedule, or there could be a known problem in 11.1 that would make RDS wait for 11.2.  So for your “order of magnitude” guess, RDS makes it available for production use before the end of the year."

Amazon RDS Database Preview Environment	"Disk got full, suddenly, at RDS MySQL. Can't find where it went
Hi,

yesterday (2018/09/06) we had a big incident using a RDS MySQL instance. The disk got full, with no discernible reason.

Can't find the cause, I'm asking for help or ideas on what to look for.

Timeline:
    - Before the incident, the RDS disk was growing in a very steady, slow, predictable way (~4GB per month).
    We had 150GB of allocated storage, and the database used ~90GB, we had ~50GB left.
    - At ~10:15 UTC, the disk started to get full very fast. We were'nt doing any backup, migration, or unusual query.
    - At ~10:45 UTC, the disk got full. The database didn't respond to queries, and we had a downtime on a service using this database. Something had spent ~50 GB of space (and we think it would have spent more, if available)
    - The downtime ended after ~12 minutes. We deleted some old/unused tables, got ~200MB of free space, and the service went up. We also increased the allocated storage, +50GBs so now we have 200GB allocated. And we deleted/optimized so got a few more GBs.
    - We have checked the disk used by database (87.26 GB right now), the binlogs (a few GB), logs (weren't enabled before the incident), and everything we found in the official doc. Can't find a cause.

Details:
    - MySQL 5.7.16
    - db.m3.large at EU (Ireland)
    - no replicas, no pending maintenance
    - the log events don't show any backup nor maintenance event near that window
    - the error log only shows some disconnections
    - disk usage screenshot: https://i.imgur.com/E0ciU0y.png

In summary:
    - Something has spent >50GB of disk. We think, if we had more disk, it would have been used, too.
    - Right now, we have 200GB allocated, with ~62GB of free space and ~138GBs of used space
    - Our database is using ~87GBs, and there those ~50GBs, that we can't find.

Questions:
    - where are the missing ~50 GBs? OS files, /tmp files? Can I recover that space?
    - any idea of what happened? Can this happen again?

I have found some similar cases, but none has been solved:

Amazon RDS Database Preview Environment	"Re: Disk got full, suddenly, at RDS MySQL. Can't find where it went
I had something very similar happen to me.  We did not have a large amount of storage used in a short amount of time, but we did have a lot of storage that we couldn't account for.  What worked for me was to update the database statistics.  Once I did that I could see where my missing storage was.  Give this command a try:

mysqlcheck -h your_rds_instance -u your_user -p your_database -a"
Amazon RDS Database Preview Environment	"Re: Disk got full, suddenly, at RDS MySQL. Can't find where it went
Thanks Brandon, I'm sure updating the db statistics would work. We did a different think, and will keep your idea in mind should it happen again.

Like you, we were suspicious of the ""information_schema"", as we found it had ~50GBs of unaccounted (but pre-allocated?) ""free"" space. We verified this by setting up a snapshot, were both the unaccounted space and the information_schema space were gone.

At the end, we just restarted the database (in a maintenance window), and the unaccounted disk problem was gone.

Should it happen again, we'll definitely try using mysqlcheck.

Thanks again,

Amazon RDS Database Preview Environment	"IAM Auth for RDS PGSQL Support for Logical Replication Connections
I'm finding that using IAM authentication token seems to work for normal pgsql connections, however when attempting to create a logical replication connection using psycopg2, the IAM auth token does not work.  On the RDS side in the logs I can see it seems to attempt regular username/password authentication in RDS PGSQL for a logical replication connection.  Are there any plans to support IAM authentication for pgsql logical replication connections?  If not, can I get a feature request out there?

Thanks!"

When I click Modify on an RDS instance, I get the message ""Internal error. Please try again or contact support if the error persists.""

Have tried this multiple times over the last week, and have also rebooted the instance, but this error persists.

The instance is of type db.m1.medium and we are wanting to convert this to db.t2.medium

We are able to Modify other instances under the same account."
Amazon RDS Database Preview Environment	"Re: Internal error when modifying RDS instance
This is the wrong forum (it is for the preview environment), the question should be directed to the RDS forum (https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=60) to increase the likeliness someone from AWS will take a look.  It is also possible (or even likely) that you'll need to open a technical support case to get help with this.

Is the instance in a VPC?  If not, then you can't use a T2.  That's not the message you traditionally get when you try to modify an EC2 Classic instance to a VPC-Only instance type, but is still the first issue that comes to mind."
Amazon RDS Database Preview Environment	"Posgres 11 GA availability?
I was wondering if anyone could provide any guidance as to when Postgres 11 in RDS is anticipated to reach general availability? I'm not looking for a specific date but perhaps an order of magnitude estimate based on historical release times? I'm trying to do some architectural planning and some of the items in our backlog would be greatly simplified with features available in pg 11."
Amazon RDS Database Preview Environment	"Re: Posgres 11 GA availability?
Historically RDS waits for the first minor release after a major release to make the release available for production.  The main reason is that the initial GA for a a major release will have serious bugs that RDS would rather not release into production.  Once that first minor release is available it takes RDS from a couple of weeks to a couple of months to make it available.  I don’t know if the existence of the preview environment will alter that schedule, but most likely not.

11.1 was released on 11/8, and normally I’d expect RDS to be making it available about now.  Re:Invent may be messing with that schedule, or there could be a known problem in 11.1 that would make RDS wait for 11.2.  So for your “order of magnitude” guess, RDS makes it available for production use before the end of the year."

Amazon RDS Database Preview Environment	"remaining connection slots are reserved for non-replication superuser
Dear Sir/Madam,
Currently I am using AWS EC2 linux instance and AWS RDS PostgreSQtL t2.micro instance. Since last 1 and half year it is working fine. I have created instance with PostgreSQL 9.3.5 and currently it is 9.3.20  due to auto Minor Version Upgrade.
But Since last two days  I am facing error of Connection slots are reserved for Non-replication Superuser and I am not be able to login to my Web based Application. As I have searched online and found that t2.micro database has limit of less connections i.e approx 32 to 34. But as per attached screen shot some times it is working fine with 62 connections. But after that it is getting hang.

So give me some suggestions for how to increase max connections or how to solve this issue permanently.

Thanks,

Amazon RDS Database Preview Environment	"Disk got full, suddenly, at RDS MySQL. Can't find where it went
Hi,

yesterday (2018/09/06) we had a big incident using a RDS MySQL instance. The disk got full, with no discernible reason.

Can't find the cause, I'm asking for help or ideas on what to look for.

Timeline:
    - Before the incident, the RDS disk was growing in a very steady, slow, predictable way (~4GB per month).
    We had 150GB of allocated storage, and the database used ~90GB, we had ~50GB left.
    - At ~10:15 UTC, the disk started to get full very fast. We were'nt doing any backup, migration, or unusual query.
    - At ~10:45 UTC, the disk got full. The database didn't respond to queries, and we had a downtime on a service using this database. Something had spent ~50 GB of space (and we think it would have spent more, if available)
    - The downtime ended after ~12 minutes. We deleted some old/unused tables, got ~200MB of free space, and the service went up. We also increased the allocated storage, +50GBs so now we have 200GB allocated. And we deleted/optimized so got a few more GBs.
    - We have checked the disk used by database (87.26 GB right now), the binlogs (a few GB), logs (weren't enabled before the incident), and everything we found in the official doc. Can't find a cause.

Details:
    - MySQL 5.7.16
    - db.m3.large at EU (Ireland)
    - no replicas, no pending maintenance
    - the log events don't show any backup nor maintenance event near that window
    - the error log only shows some disconnections
    - disk usage screenshot: https://i.imgur.com/E0ciU0y.png

In summary:
    - Something has spent >50GB of disk. We think, if we had more disk, it would have been used, too.
    - Right now, we have 200GB allocated, with ~62GB of free space and ~138GBs of used space
    - Our database is using ~87GBs, and there those ~50GBs, that we can't find.

Questions:
    - where are the missing ~50 GBs? OS files, /tmp files? Can I recover that space?
    - any idea of what happened? Can this happen again?

I have found some similar cases, but none has been solved:

Amazon RDS Database Preview Environment	"Re: Disk got full, suddenly, at RDS MySQL. Can't find where it went
I had something very similar happen to me.  We did not have a large amount of storage used in a short amount of time, but we did have a lot of storage that we couldn't account for.  What worked for me was to update the database statistics.  Once I did that I could see where my missing storage was.  Give this command a try:

mysqlcheck -h your_rds_instance -u your_user -p your_database -a"
Amazon RDS Database Preview Environment	"Re: Disk got full, suddenly, at RDS MySQL. Can't find where it went
Thanks Brandon, I'm sure updating the db statistics would work. We did a different think, and will keep your idea in mind should it happen again.

Like you, we were suspicious of the ""information_schema"", as we found it had ~50GBs of unaccounted (but pre-allocated?) ""free"" space. We verified this by setting up a snapshot, were both the unaccounted space and the information_schema space were gone.

At the end, we just restarted the database (in a maintenance window), and the unaccounted disk problem was gone.

Should it happen again, we'll definitely try using mysqlcheck.

Thanks again,
