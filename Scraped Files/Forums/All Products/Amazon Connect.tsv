Amazon Connect	"Reinitialize a Contact Attributes
Hi Folks,


I have initialized a contact Attribute with a Value (i.e. CustomerExist as True ) in one of the set Contact Attributes Block. Now In the call flow, there is some decision logic where I want to set the same initialized Contact Attribute as False. Now I have used the Set Contact Attributes where I have reinitialized the same CustomerExist as False. But this is being replaced with null ("""") value.


Any pointers on that will be appreciated.


Thanks

Hi Samrat 

Seems to work fine in my example:

Flow: https://imgur.com/a/FKjyc59
CTR: https://imgur.com/a/SqNeMoD

As the caller I hear ""True"" then ""False""

Can you provide the contact flow?

Thanks
