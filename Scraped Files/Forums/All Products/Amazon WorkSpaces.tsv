Amazon WorkSpaces	"Workspaces Arduino usb - possible?
Greetings community,

I understand that there are significant limitations to what USB devices workspaces support officially.

I have a windows Workspaces scenario where I am trying to get an Arduino https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13975 to communicate bi-directionally with the Arduino programming software in a Workspace via the client install on windows, chromeos, or ideally zeroclient(s).  

It uses https://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm drivers and seems to recognize the device, but not be able to transmit.  -- This may just not currently be possible, but I'd like to see if I can make it work.

Amazon WorkSpaces	"Workspaces MFA by SMS
Hello,
I set up Azure MFA for AWS Workspaces. I tested authentication process with Microsoft Authenticator App and it works fine:
1. Open Workspaces client
2. Enter credentials:

   2.b Password -> my Azure pass
   2.c MFA Code -> my Azure pass 
3. Push is received on my Microsoft Authenticator App - I click ""Approve""
4. Logging into Workspace.

Now we need to move from Microsoft Authenticator App to One-way SMS.
And I cannot understand where I need to enter SMS code. If I enter code in ""MFA Code"" field - nothing happens.
All instructions on Internet say that first I enter login/password then MFA Code. But Workspaces client don't allow me to start login without ""MFA code"". 

Does any bode set up mfa with one-way sms?
Thanks.

Answer:

I think I figure it out.
In Application model, no ""Challenge / Response"" is used. AWS (I am using AD Connector) send Access-request RADIUS message. Then MFA server send push notification to App, receive it and answer to AWS with Accept\Denied RADIUS Message.

In one-way sms. AWS  send Access-request RADIUS message. Then MFA server send sms AND Challenge RADIUS message back to AWS. But AWS Ignores it, because:
""AWS Directory Service does not support RADIUS Challenge/Response authentication""*

Amazon WorkSpaces	"Re: Workspaces MFA by SMS
Hello!

We use architecture with on-premise active directory servers (AD connect). 
I installed ""Azure mfa server"" (This application provided by Azure Subscription) on domain-joined server. No limitations on installation on DC.

User can be imported in Azure mfa server directly from Active Directory. I think, it can be used with Azure without on-premise servers by enabling in Azure LDAP(S)-service, but I am not sure for 100%.

Azure mfa server can provide RADIUS service itself - You don't need to deploy NPS servers. 

But there is some trick. When you are turning on MFA on AWS side - it generates two fake RADIUS Access-request messages, and it  is waiting for Access-Reject response for each of these request. I don't know why, but Azure mfa server send only one Access-Reject message to the first Access-request message, second Access-request stays without answer and AWS thinks that it is a failure.
So workaround is set up NPS service and turn it on while AWS check, then turn NPS off and turn on RADIUS service in Azure mfa server application.

After turning on MFA on AWS side - in the AWS Workspace client application You will see additional field ""MFA"". In this field You need enter password (see my first post). After this AWs will send RADIUS request to Azure mfa server."

Amazon WorkSpaces	"Linux WorkSpace vs AWS Cloud9 for development
I apologize in advance if this has been asked already. But any opinions on AWS Cloud9 vs Amazon Linux Workspaces regarding development?

After years of using Linux laptops, I currently use a Mac locally for development of several applications on AWS. Predominantly javascript front ends living either in S3 or Elastic Beanstalk. Mostly serverless under the hood. Lambda functions in Node, python, and java. Use various EC2 instances for standalone java jobs, data loading SQL stuff and tons of DynamoDB, ElasticSearch for data storage/searching/caching.

In an attempt to save someone else the time...  

we were fielding complaints from our WorkSpaces users of screen refresh ""jitter"",

After fruitless searching, and a Support Case opened with AWS, it turned out that the entire issue was caused by Google Chrome. 

Along with requests for all sorts of logging and information associated with our environment, the AWS technologist (responding to my case), included this gem: 
""We also have seen few similar issues with Windows 7 Workspaces that have Chrome 72.0.3626.81 and 71.0.3578.98""

Thank you in advance."
Amazon WorkSpaces	"Re: WorkSpaces bandwidth (data transfer) cost
Hi JohnnyC -

Depending on how your VPC is structured and where your WorkSpace(s) live, could change your billing.  In public subnets behind an Internet Gateway, you would be subject to the normal data transfer OUT charges as detailed on the EC2 pricing page i.e.: $0.09/GB up to the first 10TB.  It will be the same in private subnets, with the possibility of an additional charge if you're routing through NAT Gateways.  That would be both the price per NAT gateway (~$0.045/hr/ea) and price per GB processed (~$0.045/GB/NGW).  Double check the pricing for your specific region.

I believe the FAQ to be poorly worded, normally data transfer IN from the internet is $0/GB (downloading and streaming would be ingress).  Additional factors to consider is data transfer between WorkSpaces and other AWS services, as well as inter-region data transfer costs, especially if your WorkSpaces are in their own dedicated VPC.

Data transfer OUT, such as uploading files to Dropbox, Google Drive, WorkDocs, etc. would be billable.

The PCoIP streaming data between your connection clients and the WorkSpaces themselves would be covered under the pricing of the WorkSpaces itself.

Amazon WorkSpaces	"Re: Autostop on Linux workspaces not ""hibernating""
I'm having the same issue. I can't find any documentation that suggests hibernation (for lack of a better word, if it's not technically hibernation the marketing text seems to imply this functionality) is not supported on Amazon Linux instances of Workspaces.

When looking around I found that for EC2 instances hibernation is explicitly supported for Amazon Linux instances, but requires that the root volume has enough space to store working memory (80 GB root volume on a brand new instance, essentially nothing in memory on a standard instance with only 4 GB of memory) and the root volume must be encrypted. Initially I didn't have my root volume encrypted in Workspaces, so I just built another instance where the root volume is encrypted and I'm still not seeing hibernation. I haven't seen Workflow-specific documentation on whether this is a relevant factor.

I'm letting my Workspaces come to the ""Stopped"" state via autostop naturally after 1 hour rather than forcing it, but still don't see hibernation.

I'm trying to evaluate Workspaces to see if it would be a better flow for me, and hibernation was a big factor in leaning to this over other options. Explicit documentation one way or the other would have saved me a fair bit of time. For example, I also wanted to use the web client. and it took me several hours of debugging until I found mention that Amazon Linux isn't supported through the web client. Having a matrix of each operating system's supported features would have helped me immediately try to file an issue in the forums or stop looking completely.

edit: 

I found this:

https://aws.amazon.com/workspaces/faqs/

Q: Will my Amazon WorkSpace running in AutoStop running mode preserve the state of applications and data when it stops?

WorkSpaces with Windows preserve the data and state of your applications when stopped. On reconnect, your Amazon WorkSpace will resume with all open documents and running programs intact. Amazon Linux WorkSpaces and Graphics enabled WorkSpaces with Windows preserve your data when stopped, and any running application sessions will be closed. On reconnect, your Amazon WorkSpace will retain your files and folders in your last saved location.

Amazon WorkSpaces	"Re: Autostop on Linux workspaces not ""hibernating""
Thanks, Ray -- that's the smoking gun.  Looks like they are explicitly NOT supporting ""hibernation"" for Linux workspaces or Graphics workspaces...  at least not yet.

This would be a great feature to have for Linux workspaces, and I hope that AWS will file this as a feature request.

In the meantime, I've set the workspace for my one user who cares a lot about this functionality to the AlwaysOn running mode, so we'll be charged the ""monthly pricing"" for this one user.  She uses it enough of the day every day that it's arguably no more expensive to do it this way for her, but in the long run, there are other users who are lighter workspace users for whom it might make a huge price difference, so the feature would be very nice to have as we scale up to an environment where nearly every user in the company each has their own workspace, and most of these will be Linux workspaces."

Amazon WorkSpaces	"Re: Subnet that is not supported by the WorkSpaces service
Hello,

Thank You for contacting AWS Forums!

The reason you are getting this error is that Workspaces is not supported in all Availability Zones where Active Directory is supported. So, if you launched your Directory in subnets belonging to these AZs, you will face the error described here.

Supported AZs differ from account to account as us-east-1b might be us-east-1c for you. They also differ based on the AWS region. So, it is not possible for me to determine the Supported AZs for Workspaces in your AWS account.

If possible, please share the directory ID of your Workspaces Directory with us over a private message and I will try to determine the supported subnets for you.

Another way to launch workspaces would be to try to launch your AD in some other subnets and then trying to register the directory again.

Here is another AWS Forums thread around this issue:

Amazon WorkSpaces	"Re: MySql Workbench in AWS Linux WorkSpace
So I've figured out one way to run MySql Workbench on an AWS Workspace, but it's not a solution, just a clue to the root problem. And evidently this is not an AWS workspaces-specific issue, that is it's reproducible on a non-workspaces Amazon Linux 2 instance. If I replace the following Amazon Linux 2 /usr/lib64 shared objects with those of the same version number from CentOS (el7.x86_64.rpm packages instead of amzn2.x86_64 packages), then MySql Workbench runs successfully.

libcairomm-1.0.so.1.4.0
libgdkmm-3.0.so.1.1.0
libgdk_pixbuf-2.0.so.0.3600.5
libglibmm-2.4.so.1.3.0
libgtkmm-3.0.so.1.1.0
libpcrecpp.so.0.0.0

I say this is not a solution because I'm aware that I've not used proper maintenance procedures and likely destabilized my OS. But it seems to show that there is a library issue with either MySql Workbench and/or Amazon Linux 2. I'd think if the MySql Workbench el7 package had a library dependency issue then there would be complaints that it didn't work on RHEL/CentOS, and I don't see evidence of this online (which I realize isn't conclusive proof). Which leaves, either Amazon Linux 2 has a compatibility problem for some libraries with RHEL/CentOS (on which it's supposed to be based); or it is what it is and someone needs to build an Amazon Linux 2-specific MySql Workbench package; or ...? So does anyone who knows about Linux versions and libraries (I'm not a Linux admin nor developer) have an idea as to the proper resolution? Thanks for any attempts at answers."

Hi  Friends,

I am working on Global Air quality forecasting project for my Data Scientist studies through Aegis.
I have an Excel file with VBA code written in it, where it does the following tasks:

1. For a selected folder, which has 1200 files, and each file has almost 3 lacs+ records, and each file size is almost 30 mb to 200 mb. File type is CSV.
2. Each file has a timestamp column,  where l am splitting the timestamp column value in each row into date and time column, using vba, and then saving as excel file(xlsx).
3.To process each file it takes, approximately 1 to 2 hours on an average.
4. Currently, l am doing it on my laptop, which will take many days, as it will take approximately 1200 to 2400 hours, i.e. 24-48 days, if run day and night, for 24 hours. I have already processed 263+ years of data, using my laptop.
5. Hence, l am thinking of using AWS Workspace to get Windows and MS Office on cloud, and next using Opsworks Puppet Enterprise, to quickly finish the task by running multiple nodes on AWS cloud. However, this will cost me money for Workspace and Puppet Enterprise, approximately Rs. 25000, over and above the free trial offered.
6. After this processing, l still need to further do processing of converting latitude and longitude metrics to location name using Google maps places api or Bing maps api, for the same dataset using vba.
7. Thereafter, l need to make a model using machine learning in time series or ltsm in deep learning, with best accuracy, for forecasting.

Hence, for cleaning the dataset, before running it, for model making on cloud, l need to know if we can connect workspaces with Puppet Enterprise, and if yes, how, at lowest possible cost, lower than above mentioned estimate.
Please advise if there is any other option to make the things work on cloud at minimal cost using free tier options.

Amazon WorkSpaces	"PCoIP & Teradici
Are those required?  I have a single workspace that my user connects to using the workspaces client. That workspace is domain joined.  User complains he can't switch between one sided and two sided printing so I hopped on his workspace only to find it absolutely crawling.  Looking at the running processes, I found the PCoIP process taking 90+% CPU consistently. Once I finally got access to the printer settings, I found he was stuck using the Teradici XPS driver for his Canon IR, which didn't allow him to modify any settings. Since the workspaces report as server 2016, the Canon driver I need won't install locally, although it does get pushed up from his workstation.  If I disable the Teradici service and reboot, he can't print at all, even when I switch the driver over to the one pushed up by his workstation. I can't seem to find any information on whether those are required to access the workspace, or whether it's safe to delete them.

**edit** connecting from a different workstation fixes the performance issue, but all printers are still using the Teradici Client Render XPS driver which does not allow for any changes to printing preferences.  I would update the agent (currently at 2.7.x.x.x and it appears the latest is 2.14.x.x.x) but I have no confidence that won't break more than it fixes (if anything).

Amazon WorkSpaces	"Re: PCoIP & Teradici
Short answer: yes.
When you say ""PCoIP"", I presume you are referring to the pcoip_server*.exe executable that you see running.  And ""Teradici"" is the ""Teradici XPS driver"" service. 

The ""Teradici"" printer service is what allows you to print remotely, so of course if you stop it, you will have disabled all the printing.

Communicating remotely to a printer is non-trivial, and in order to get the features of a specific printer you'll generally need the drivers for that printer installed on the VM side.  As you discovered, this can be problematic if the VM is running on a Windows Server OS vs the desktop.

Don't try and manually upgrade the Teradici Standard Agent on your workspace.  AWS periodically checks the installed version and will automatically revert the version.  But that wouldn't help as the fundamental limitation of the printer plugin remains.

https://www.teradici.com/web-help/pcoip_agent/standard_agent/windows/2.14.0/admin-guide/configuring/configuring-tasks/ mentions a bit about the printer driver. 

Not much can be done unless Canon comes out with printer drivers that support Server 2016."

1) Possibly--see below
2) ditto
3) if you rebuild the workspace you will lose the contents of its C: drive

If the workspace will not boot, then RDPing into it will not be a useful exercise as there will not be a running VM into which you can RDP.  It is useful if the VM actually did boot but was somehow not responding to other health checks, in which case you could at least get in there and inspect the file systems.  But you mentioned you already tried that, so time for step 2....

What you might try doing is either creating another workspace, or to save yourself a few dollars, spin up a Windows EC2 instance in the same VPC as your workspace.  What you'll do is mount the file systems of your old workspace onto this new Windows VM, and get the data that way.

Go to your AWS console and under the EC2 service, check the volumes, and you should be able to see the volumes for all your VMs, including for your old C and D drive.

Once  you've found them what you'll want to do is mount (attach) these volumes onto your new workspace/EC2 volume as, say, drives E: and F:.  Then you can determine if your C: drive has any data  you need saved.

See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-attaching-volume.html

As far as I understood the maintenance window should be from saturday to sunday night (0:00-4:00). Still, when I turned my workspace on after changing it to always on this sunday afternoon (around 2pm) shortly after a couple of minutes a window popped up which told me that updates will be installed at 2:22pm or if I want, then I can do it right now.

Is that normal behaviour => do updates happen just at any time? 

Why were these updates not installed tonight as it says in the documentation? Did it have something to do with the change to always-on instance and this was therefor a one-time thing?

Amazon WorkSpaces	"Caps lock coming on at Random in Workspace Client
We are having an issue with a number of users where Caps lock will engage at random.

different hardware (HP laptop, desktops, dells etc) 
ensure all updates / hotfixs  patches upto date on the hardware / OS
we rebooted / rebuilt / recreated workspace login for effected users using fresh, untouched image


Have tried sorting the issue via support but not getting anywhere.  I see others have had this in the past but yet to see a solution.

Its very frustrating for our users & for us trying to support without an answer.  Any help would be greatly appreciated"
Amazon WorkSpaces	"WorkSpaces no longer works after November 19th update
Clearly not many people use WorkSpaces, or at least post in the forums... because I would have expected the forum to be blowing up right now.  (Unless somehow this is specifically related to my account.)

I've already written ""feedback"" to the WorkSpaces team... but after a day I have not had a response so maybe this will help.

Yesterday (the 19th) when I got into the office and was going to login to my WorkSpace I was prompted to do a WorkSpaces update... I installed it and after that I could no login to my WorkSpace.

When trying to login I just get a message ""An error occurred while launching your WorkSpace.  Please try again.""

Others at my office have not done the update and can login just fine.  I am working at home today and I was able to login to my WorkSpace while ignoring the update.  But after applying the update here on my home computer I can no longer login.  I get the same error message.

I realize for everybody else that may be coming to these forums, it's probably too late for you.  But just know it is related to the update.  Advise anybody else that may be using WorkSpaces to skip this update.  It is broken.

It has nothing to do with Windows version either, as my work computer is Windows 7, my home computer is Windows 10.

Hopefully this is addressed soon as I do use WorkSpaces most days.

Amazon WorkSpaces	"Re: WorkSpaces no longer works after November 19th update
Ian, thanks for reaching out and sorry for the inconvenience the issue might have caused. 

We are actively investigating the issue. It's not widespread. However, we've got two reports for such errors.

While we are working on a fix, as a workaround, you can download and install the old version (2.4.10) and do not click update on the popup: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/workspaces-client-beta/Windows/2.4.10/Amazon+WorkSpaces.msi

Hopefully this can get you back the access to your WorkSpace. Thank you for your patience.

Thanks,
Lihao"

I am also experiencing this problem. Windows 7 client here. Also noticed it happened since the update.
Looking at advanced logging I see references to ""Server Error 500: Internal Server error"" in the log . I don't know if such errors were there before as I never looked at the logs until this started happening.

We have deployed a potential fix. Would you mind checking again with the updated client? Thanks!"
Amazon WorkSpaces	"Re: WorkSpaces no longer works after November 19th update
I can confirm the update does NOT work. I just used the link in the About field of the existing client to download and install the latest client. Got  version 2.5.0.1055 and this version exhibits the same problem as originally described in this thread."
Amazon WorkSpaces	"Re: WorkSpaces no longer works after November 19th update
Your original suggestion of downgrading the client DID work, so I am using that as a workaround in the interim."
Amazon WorkSpaces	"Re: WorkSpaces no longer works after November 19th update
Hi, do you have a download link for the older (2.4) macOS client?  We are experiencing the same issue under macOS.  Thanks!"
Amazon WorkSpaces	"Re: WorkSpaces no longer works after November 19th update
So this is the second time I've encountered this error, ""An error occurred while launching your WorkSpace"".  The first time I rebuilt my workspace.  It seems as I've experienced both after a Windows update was applied.  I was using my Workspace (Windows 10) and I noticed there was an update to be applied.  Shortly after I'm unable to connect which furthers makes me believe it is Windows update related.  Know this is a possibility it really frustrates me as I had to painfully reinstall all my applications after the first time this happened.  On a whim I tried going back to the previous client as suggested here; however, this did not help.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.  If I have to rebuild again, I'm ditching Workspace as it's not worth my time or money to pay for compute that is this flaky.

Mac client 2.4.10 download  https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/workspaces-client-beta/OSX/2.4.10/WorkSpaces.pkg 

It seems the fix we applied (on the service side) did not fully resolve the issue. And we are still investigating.  The issue is only happening to a few WorkSpaces. We'd appreciate if you could open a support case ( https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home ) so that we can look into your specific WorkSpace. Thanks!

Best,
