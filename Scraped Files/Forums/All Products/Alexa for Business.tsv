Alexa for Business	"Re: Terms of Use & Privacy Policy
Thanks for your interest in Alexa for Business.

The Alexa for Business service terms are included in the AWS service terms

We also have a whitepaper available that provides an overview of Alexa system, security features of Echo hardware, and data use within the Alexa cloud.

Alexa for Business	"Resolve Room API
I am not sure which set of credentials I should be sending over when making a call to the Resolve Room service. The response I receive with every set of credentials I have tried is ""Exception: ValidationException: Skill ID is invalid, not registered or is owned by a different account""; should the access key and secret key be credentials associated with the AWS/Alexa for Business account where the skill is deployed or should it be associated with the developer account who created the app.  If I am to use the developer account credentials, how does one associate an AWS access key and secret key with a developer login?"
Alexa for Business	"Re: Resolve Room API
Access to resolveRoom API is a bit special. You must use the AWS credentials from the account where you run your Lambda function, but there is an additional authorization that is put in place when you import the skill as private skill to your AWS account.

When you import a skill as private skill, we will look at the AWS account id where you run the Lambda function and automatically put in authorization in place for the resolveRoom API.

1. Are you using an Lambda endpoint for your skill?

2. Did you make this skill already a private skill and published it to your AWS account?"
Alexa for Business	"Re: Resolve Room API
Hi Milo,

I am not using a Lambda endpoint.  Is an absolute requirement?

My skill is private and published to an AWS account as a private skill, I can use AWS Alexa for Business and see the skill.  The skill works as expected via a shared device as expected (w/o ResolveRoom), so I believe I have the skill/Alexa For Business set up correctly.

James"
Alexa for Business	"Re: Resolve Room API
No, Lambda is not an absolute requirement. We only need to manually your AWS account id and skill id to call this API.

Can you send me a private message with this info?"
Alexa for Business	"Re: Resolve Room API
I have similar problems and have a couple of questions:

Does what you wrote mean that this manual process is required every time a new Alexa For Business AWS account wants to use the skill with a Resolve Room call?
What about when I want the skill to be public and still use Resolve Room is that possible?

Can you help me too with enabling Resolve Room for my skill?"
Alexa for Business	"Re: Resolve Room API
No, it is a one time action to whitelist a skill and the AWS account id from where the skill is calling the API. Once the whitelist is in place, you can use the skill in as many Alexa for Business setup as you like.

You can also use it for skills that will be published in the public Alexa skills store.

Please send me a private message with skill id and AWS account id and I will get you whitelisted.
We will update documentation to make this process more transparent for customers not using Lambda in their skill.

Alexa for Business	"Re: Echo Dot showing Offline with Alexa for Business
Hi Milo, 

We're in the United Kingdom (small little island in what is currently ""Europe"")  and looking at using Echo devices to integrate with a third party room management skill called ""Teem"". However I'm concerned about the lack of support for Echo devices outside the US, which I believe is even further restricted to certain states in the US?

Our test device hasn't been used for a while and is now in the offline state, and we therefore can't update it etc. Is this likely to happen quite a lot? If so then these devices aren't FFP for us.

I'm really surprised. - Well, honestly only half surprised, about the lack of support outside the US. Will this ever change, or are these devices just going to kept as a consumer device outside the US?

I'd appreciate an idea of what we can and can't expect by using these devices in the UK. Currently our project is on hold, pending the outcome to these concerns.

i really can't use these devices if I can't put a half decent SLA around them.

Many thanks,

Hi,

I'm working on a project to enable hands-free communication at our work place, both out of practicality as well as the need to have operators not touch shared electronics (clean room environment).

Alexa for Business	"Re: Alexa for business API on Amazon echo shared device
Thanks for your interest in Alexa for Business.

What Alexa for Business APIs are you specifically referring to?
The Alexa for Business APIs (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/a4b/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html) available in the AWS SDK/CLI use standard AWS security credentials. 

Most of these APIs are independent of the device type.

Alexa for Business	"Shared devices always showing status as offline
Hi,
I have used Alexa for business and set up the device. After set up it was showing status as online in the screen (A4B > Shared devices) for 3 minutes, but latter it started showing it as ""Offline"" status. 
Now the device is showing offline only always.

I tried multiple options (as detailed below) to make the device online. But all my attempts got failed and device is in still offline status only. 

1. I tried ""Deregister device"" option and degistered the devices and latter i tried setup the device thru A4B Device set up tool, but still showing offline only for the shared device status
2: I triied ""Deregister device"" and made factor reset by pressing reset button below my device and latter tried with A4B Device set up tool, but still showing offline only for the shared device status

Eric"
Alexa for Business	"Re: Shared devices always showing status as offline
Hi Eric,

I am connecting Alexa from my Organizataion, my organization IPs all are attached to US region. 

Eventhough, I am physically not present in US region, but my organization IP from which Alexa is attached, is part of US region. I have already looked in earlier case in the support forum which was mentioning related to region. 

In my opinion, my current problem - status of showing 'Offline' is not related to region; 

In one another device which I am facing the same problem related to showing 'offline'. I observed following thing.

Step-1 : I connected my Echo device to A4B as shared device, It was showing correctly online. Eventhough i have not attached to any room.
Step-2: After a hour (until that it was showing online), I de-registered from A4B console and connected it as personal device to my Amazon account (regular consumer account) which was I using earlier. 
Step-3: Again now, I connected my Echo device to A4B as shared device, now it showed Online for brief moment ( < 2 mins), latter it started showing 'Offline'. 
Step-4: I tried, reset, de-register and connect back again as shared device for couple of times, but it always shows as offline. 

This is the primary reason, I believe the problem i face ( 'Offline' status) is not attributed to Region.

As I was persistantly facing the problem, now with Echo-Plus device (xx-052A), i started to connect as PErsonal device for A4B. For most of the use cases like (checking the calendar, linking to Office 365, dial into meeting for the event in the calendar) are working as part of personal device. 

I still have the problem when i connect it as share device and it always shows it  as 'offline'. 

By any chance, it can when shared device is de-registered and connected it as personal device again. After this when we re-connect the personal device as shared device, we encounter this problem (showing offline). This is my experience related with two of my devices (not just one).

Probably i may be overthinking it. Apologize for lengthy mail.

We are working to add support for one of our conferencing devices in Alexa for Business.  We would like to test the scheduled meeting path but have not been able to get Alexa for Business to recognize the invitation for the room.  When we say ""Alexa start meeting"" at the time a meeting is scheduled, Alexa always asks for a meeting id. 

We have a  GSuite admin account linked to Alexa for Business and an email account assigned to a conference room. From what I have read Alexa for Business needs to know the invitation template for each conference device to parse out the meeting id/pin.

We are in the process of rolling out a4b coupled with chime conferencing. The problem we have had so far is that the spec for what an alexa device needs in order to do audio or sip calls is vague in the documentation. Typical corporate environments are going to want to whitelist where these devices are calling out to for outbound connections on udp. It's difficult to ask for internal device -> to the internet without scoping it down to a fqdn or subnet block of ip's. 

I'm referring to this page: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/a4b/latest/ag/firewall-network.html

HI,

Currently i dont see any cookbook available in GitHub or any forum regarding the usage of A4B API. 

When i try this, we are facing lot of problem. Just curious to know any cookbook or sample code available related to A4B aPI (NodeJS specific). 

This will be really helpful and increase the number of develper embracing the skill development for A4B.

One more question:
I have added personal device for Alexa for Business, and linked thru the user in A4B Console. In addition i have linked by Office 365 calednar to my personal device. Now all the calendar operation are working and i can dial into meeting (by using Skype PSTN).

If i want to build custom skill and modify the calendar event or check the event details in my calendar. In this scenario can I use the A4B Calendar API directly and modify it? Or i need to use only the Office 365 API alone directly to perform this operation. ? I hear from my colleagues, using office 365 API is very hard to work with the calendar.

I am in process of building custom skill to read and modify the calendar, so wondering is I can do with A4B API directly ?

Cookbook or sample code will be really helpful."
Alexa for Business	"Re: Cookbook for usage of A4B API
Hi IlanG,

Glad to hear you are continuing to explore Alexa for Business!

We have a public repository of some sample skills that use Alexa for Business on Github - see https://github.com/alexa/alexa-for-business for more details.

These skills showcase how to use A4B APIs such as ResolveRoom to determine location of a device or they depend on private skill distribution to make sure that only an organization's users can discover a skill and not the general public.

At this time, there are no specific A4B calendar APIs. As a skill developer, you don't have access to the A4B organization's calendar credentials or to the personal account's calendar.

If you have access to the O365 APIs and credentials, I think integrating directly with those into your skill is the best way to get more integration in a private skill.

Note that Alexa today can help you create meetings, move meetings, schedule time with someone else with the Smart Scheduling Assistant, and more based on your linked O365 calendar in your personal account. See this blog post for more information on the Smart Scheduling Assistant: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/business-productivity/new-schedule-meetings-with-the-alexa-smart-scheduling-assistant/

Hello EricC,

Thank you for your message. 

Currently I am using all the features mentioned in blog (except allowing Alexa to Schedule meeting based on other Receiever free time).

I faced couple of issues (or probably not supported by Alexa now).

1. If I (Ilan) schedule a meeting with John on Tuesday 3 PM and if already John calendar is occupied Tuesday  3PM. In this case Alexa is not highlighting the conflicts, it just goes and schedules the meeting even though, if any conflict is there. It will be good, atlest Alexa alerts, John calendar is occupied at Tuesday at 3 PM.
2.  Currently I am not able to modify the existing event (not changing the time, just the content alone). Alexa doesnt  provide the option, it only provides option to change the time of the event.
3. I am not able to add new participant to the meeting.

Honestly as skill developer need of the hour to leverage A4B is to have good support in terms of A4B API, so we can build more custom skill."
Alexa for Business	"Re: Cookbook for usage of A4B API
Hi IlanG,

1. There are some prerequisites in order for Alexa to tell if John has a meeting at the time you're trying to schedule. For example, can you confirm that John's email address in your Alexa contacts (usually synced with your phone contacts) and that the calendar you have synced with Alexa has access to read John's calendar? When Alexa has access to this information, you will get a response that will suggest open times for the two of you to meet. If not, Alexa will create the meeting at the time you suggested.
2. Correct, not supported today.
3. Also not supported today.

Hello Sushant,

Thank you for your reply. It throws some light.

BTW, I am sharing few of the urgent features, which will be helpful for us:

1. currently I dont see the way how can i modify the existing event (not changing the time, just the content alone), it doesnt provide the option. It provides only option to change the time of the event.
2. For the sceduled event with another person (where email is send to other person) in my calendar. I dont have option to add new invitee or change the invitee. Again i have option only to change the time but not the invitee list of the content of it. 
3. Currently i am able to send meeting invite to person only if he is my Alexa app contact (this is loaded in turn from my phone contact list). Due to this, i add manually the new contact in phone contact list  and latter Alexa app synchronises it. It will be good if it takes from the contact which i added in Alexa for business console. Central location of managing the contact in Alexa for Business for both, Shared device and personal device will be helpful, otherwise it kind of painful feature at this moment of manually adding every of my organization contact (witih email ) in my phone contact list.
4. Currently I am able to send meeting invite only to person but not book the room. If i say ""Alexa schedule meeting with John in meeting room Amstredam"", it should send meeting invite to John and as well as book the meeting room Amstredam (by sending email invite). This facility is not available.
5. Apart from this, when i add my personal device thru Alexa for Business, it should provide more features, apart from the regular features which are provided for  regular consumer when they integrate the calendar.

Alexa for Business	"Send text to an Amazon Echo device and have it turned to speech
For a project I work now, we need to play some audio warnings triggered by some events detected by the system. These events can trigger a large number of messages so it kind of makes sense to use Polly API to turn theses messages into speech. So we can run a service that will use the Polly API to turn text into an .MP3 audio file containing the test read by one of the voices. Can I now send this audio file programmatically to an Amazon Echo would play it out loud (assuming that the Amazon Echo can somehow be connected to our network - I would guess it can)? Alternatively, can I send the text to the Amazon Echo device and have it deal with Polly, turn in into speech and play the resulting audio file?

You always have to invoke Alexa and than can get a response back. This can be either a TTS response that Alexa will speak out or a short mp3 snippet that can be generate from your skill using Polly if you want to use a different voice.

Alexa for Business	"Re: Publishing Skill
Hi CompuVision,

Thanks for your interest in Alexa for Business. 

Private skills can only be deployed within your organization. There are two options for your scenario: 

1. You could take the code and share that with your clients but they would need to host the instance of the skill for themselves. 

2. If this is scale-able for your team, you can invite your clients to join your A4B organization. When they do, the skill would be available for them to use.  You can also build an website to do self-service signup for clients and use our APIs to send them the invite. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/a4b/latest/APIReference/API_CreateUser.html

Public skill make it easier for others to find and add the skill but securing it requires more work for your team otherwise anyone could add/invoke the skill. You will need some form of account linking to your auth system to ensure that they are who you expect them to be.

Alexa for Business	"2 Separate Issues Regarding Enrolled Users and Calenders/Contacts-Office365
We have encountered a couple issues with enrolled users and calendars/contacts.

Case 1: User is enrolled in Alexa for Business using an Echo show.  The user can create appointments in their calendar fine, but his contacts don't seem to sync properly.  The contacts he wishes to add show up in his iPhone's contact list and the contact list on his Alexa app, but not in the drop-in/messaging/calling portion of the contact list (additionally, when he asks his Echo Show to show him his contacts, the desired contacts do not appear).  This prevents him from scheduling meetings with the contacts in question, dropping in or messaging them, and calling them.  Could it be an issue with the app?  He has logged in and out, deleted and reinstalled, reset the device, but has not unregistered and set it up again.

Case 2: User is enrolled with Alexa for Business using an Echo Dot.  User can create appointments in her calendar, but when she attempts to move or delete them, the Dot gives an error message: ""this calendar query is not supported"" (may not be exact message).  Furthermore, when trying to schedule a meeting with a contact also enrolled as a user, rather than inviting them, it simply displayed their name in the title (the user who we wished to invite is the user in case 1, maybe it's related).
U: ""Alexa, schedule a meeting with Braden tomorrow""
A: ""Okay, at what time?""
...
The meeting appears as ""(Meeting name) with (User)"" and does not invite the user to the meeting.

Hopefully this all makes sense, I apologize for the lengthiness.

Thank you in advance.

Alexa for Business	"Re: 2 Separate Issues Regarding Enrolled Users and Calenders
Thanks for your interest in Alexa for Business. 

Case 1: Contact sync doesn't work
If the contact is not showing up in drop in, the contact might have not enabled drop in with this user. Check if the user who is being called or messaged has allowed drop in on their Alexa App for the user making the call or drop in.

Case 2: Error message when moving or deleting calendar events
This seems like a permissions issue. The user may not have been setup with the right permissions to perform edit or delete. It looks like you are using Office 365 but I want to confirm this and that it is not the O365 linking to on-premise Exchange.

Case 3: Meeting does not send an invite to the user
This happens because the contact named is not recognized as a contact in the organizer's contacts. I'll follow up with you to get some details so we can look at it.

Alexa for Business	"Connecting Alexa to Conferencing Equipment
Our office has Nureva HDL300 Audio Conferencing Systems in our board rooms.  This system gives us a superior sound quality, both incoming and outgoing.  Currently Alexa is not compatible with this device (the manufacturer has not yet developed a skill that allows this).  My question is, will Alexa ever be able to host conference calls for it (replacing the phones so we don't have to manually dial in) while allowing both incoming and outgoing audio to be directed through this type of audio system?  It is my understanding that at the moment Alexa can only send audio out to external speakers (other devices cannot act as mics for it), but as the quality we receive from this audio system is superior, it would be very beneficial if the Nureva could also act as the microphone for us.  I'm not familiar how the already deployed audio/video conferencing systems work (Vonage, Polycom, etc.), but I assume it would be similar in function to what I am describing.  If this is not possible at the moment, is this something Amazon would work towards adding as a feature in the future?"
Alexa for Business	"Re: Connecting Alexa to Conferencing Equipment
Thanks for your interest in Alexa for Business.

Correct, the aux plug on Echo or Echo Dot is only for audio output. 
To voice enable this equipment and ask Alexa to start your meeting, you'd need an Alexa skill that is implemented using the conference device APIs (https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa-for-business/build-skills-for-conferencing-devices.html). This API is implemented for the equipment we support today like Cisco Telepresence systems.

To invoke this skill from an Alexa endpoint, currently customers deploy an Echo Dot next to their equipment and use this as controller. We are also working with several vendors to get Alexa into their endpoint using the Alexa Voice Service. This would eliminate the requirement to have Echo Dot in the room. 

If there is an API or other way to remotely control the Nureva, you could build a private skill and call the API from your Lambda function.

Alexa for Business	"Can Enrolled Users Book Meeting Rooms with the Smart Scheduling Assistant
Our meeting rooms have email addresses associated with them to link to our calendar, and we were just wondering if we could schedule meetings in these rooms from our personal devices (enrolled users of course).  I couldn't find any documentation on this.  Would we have to potentially enroll them as users, or could this be accomplished without doing that? 

Thank you in advance,"
Alexa for Business	"Re: Can Enrolled Users Book Meeting Rooms with the Smart Scheduling Assistant
Hi CompuVision,

Thanks for your interest in Alexa for Business. There is no provided way to book a room through enrolled user. However, here is a way you could do this:

1. Create contacts in your phone that map to room names with their email addresses. For example, you can create a room called 'Alpha' and 'Bravo'. Alpha has an email address alpha@example.com and Bravo has an email address bravo@example.com.

2. Open the Alexa mobile app and sync the contacts.

3. From your enrolled device, ask ""Alexa, schedule a meeting with Alpha.""  

Now, Alexa will look up your availability against the availability of alpha@example.com and suggest meeting times. If Alpha doesn't have availability for the time you are looking for, you would have to ask ""Alexa, schedule a meeting with Bravo.""

Alexa looks at the availability of those rooms using your calendar (not a new calendar) so as long as you can see availability for your room using the calendar you have linked with Alexa, it should work. There is no need to 'enroll' those rooms as users. 

I'd be interested in hearing more about your scenario. Will reach out via a private message."

Alexa for Business	"Best method for deployment?
We are pilot testing Alexa for Business in our company of 40+ employees. We'd like to deploy echo dots to each person in their office, and have echo plus's in the conference rooms. We have a few echo devices here to start testing. There are a couple things I've ran into that I'd like advice on.

How would you recommend setting up the echo dots in each persons office? As a room, or have them set it up as a personal device and then link their personal account to Alexa for Business?

Setting them up as ""rooms"" would be easier on the IT side, but would cost more per person (shared device charge vs user charge), and we would not be able to use the voice recognition for security, plus you don't get some of the options that I think people would use, like pandora, spotify, etc.

Setting up each device with a personal account would be a nightmare on the IT side. Some people might not have an Amazon account, so we'd have to help them set it up, one by one. Even if they DID have a personal Amazon account we would probably have to walk them through adding their dot to their account, and then help them link it with Alexa for Business. Another downside would be address books. If they link it to their personal account, then they won't have access to the Alexa for Business address book, unless they add their work email contact list to their phone, then link it to the echo. If they don't do this then they won't be able to call another dot device in someone else's office. It seems like it would be a large load on IT to set all this up.

I'm trying to limit the load on IT to support these devices, it doesn't look like, right now anyways, that Alexa for Business is setup to deploy in large quantities. Maybe we are trying to use it in a way that it's not really built to work.

Here is what I ""want"" it do do. I want to be able to sit at my desk, and tell Alexa ""Call Amy"" and it calls Amy's echo dot across the building in her office. I also want to be able to join work conference calls, add and delete events on my work calendar. I also want it to be able to do some of the more personal things, like each person be able to link to their pandora, or spotify account.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I really want to be able to deploy this to my company. It's a really cool idea, and I hope that they continue to develop it in the future to give more flexibility."
Alexa for Business	"Re: Best method for deployment?
Hi JCunningham,

Thank you for your interest in Alexa for Business. Responding to your questions:

How would you recommend setting up the echo dots in each persons office? As a room, or have them set it up as a personal device and then link their personal account to Alexa for Business?

I would recommend using personal devices if you want to allow each user to be able to personalize the device. For example, by linking a work calendar, they can use 'Alexa, join the meeting' to hop onto a scheduled conference call. They can say 'What's on my calendar' or 'Schedule a meeting with John'. They can also play music and other skills that they may already have at home. The beauty of this is that it means when they go home, if they have an Alexa device, they can do the very same things from there. 
We recommend shared devices in conference rooms or in open area where a person doesn't need to be known such as frontdesk, copy room, etc. 


Setting up each device with a personal account would be a nightmare on the IT side. Some people might not have an Amazon account, so we'd have to help them set it up, one by one.

You are running into the same issue as discussed in this forum thread: https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=270482&tstart=0 

What basically happens is after the device is provisioned and reboot, it will do a lookup of the closest Alexa service endpoint. As you are in India, it will automatically connect to that endpoint.
Because Alexa for Business is only available on the Alexa service endpoints in the US, the device can't connect and therefore stays in sync pending state.

We've enabled the Teem.com skill (using all the same server information https://forums.aws.amazon.com/, and username/password/delegation settings, and email addresses for the exchange room resources) and it works 100% when we use ""ask Teem when the next meeting is""

We're in a hosted exchange platform, not sure if that's part of the problem."

I have similar issue. I have configured Echo 2 for a conference room. I have successfully configured Office 365 Calendar (admin account), added room calendar email address, and set up Skype for Business conferencing. When I try to join the scheduled Skype for Business meeting, I get prompted to enter the meeting ID. I already have Skype Meeting scheduled for this time. Why doesn't echo automatically join the Skype meeting?"
Alexa for Business	"Re: Shared Device Says Calendar Not Set Up
Thanks for your feedback.

When you link a calendar to your room, the calendar is currently only used to join scheduled meetings. You can't ask Alexa yet what is on the calendar, this is only available for personally linked calendar. 

We recently found an issue with joining of Skype for Business meetings. The team has a fix ready and is working deployment."

Thanks Milo for the feedback. I was unable to have my shared device join a scheduled meeting automatically. In this case it was a Webex. When I said join the conference it prompted me for the meeting ID like it would before when no Exchange calendar was linked."
Alexa for Business	"Re: Shared Device Says Calendar Not Set Up
Closing on this forum thread. The team also deployed changes to improve detecting webex invites. You should now able to automatically join Skype for Business and Webex meetings."
Alexa for Business	"Re: Shared Device Says Calendar Not Set Up
Hi Milo,
It seems the issue is still there:
1. After scheduling meeting on Office 365 and setup Amazon Chime as default voice provider, A4B Echo will automatically start the conferencing while issuing 'Start/join the meeting) without meeting ID asking
2. If changing voice provider to Skype for Business, some weird symptoms: 

Echo will ask for meeting ID and PIN code (even 'no PIN code required' is set in A4B) instead joining the meeting automatically
After providing meeting ID/PIN code, Echo dials in Skype who asks meeting ID/PIN code again


Is there any way we can check if A4B (or Echo/skill version) is updated and deployed? Thanks"
Alexa for Business	"Re: Shared Device Says Calendar Not Set Up
Thanks for your feedback.

1. I looks like the service that determines the meeting dial-in information isn't compatible with the Skype for Business invites you are sending out. It would be great to get sample invite, so they team can investigate. I will drop you a private message with my email address.

2. I don't have directly an idea what could be wrong here. Let me follow-up with the team what this could be.

Milo - If a4b has only ability to detect conf providers and not read out my meetings or schedule any meeting , then should I link my device wih the alexa mobile app to have my calendar update over voice commands ?  IF I register my Echo dot in Alexa mobile app, will it not de-register it from aws / a4b ? 

I think at any point of time I can link the Echo Dot eihter to the mobile app or in aws ? Am i wrong  ?

Regards
