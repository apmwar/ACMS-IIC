Looks like I have been banned a long with most other users.  Is this true?  I know that I have not been using any bots or anything that violates the TOS to my knowledge and would like to shed some light on this issue.  I also had about $170 on my dashboard waiting to be sent to the 'my account' page that I can no longer access.

Problems building Mechanical Turk Requester Toolkit. Got following error  in connection with [generate-axis] target of build.xml script:
'The <urn:maven-artifact-ant:dependencies> type doesn't support the nested ""dependency"" element. '
My Windows 2000 system has JDK 5.0, Ant 1.6.1, JWSDP 1.6, and Axis 1.2.1 installed, with their environment variables set as per docs.
I want JAXB binding, so I first ran ant as follows:
G:\mech_turk_src> ant -Djwsdp.dir=F:\Sun\jwsdp-1.6 prepare-jaxb
Build failed with error: 'The <urn:maven-artifact-ant:dependencies> type doesn't support the nested ""pom"" element.'
As a workaround, I copied JAXB-related .jar files (8) to the \binding\jaxb\pom folder, which helped get me past the [prepare-jaxb] target. I've studied the build.xml and rtk-with-jaxb.pom files, and they both show nested <dependency> elements. Is this caused by Ant or  the Maven (maven-artifact-ant-2.0-dep.jar  not handling the <urn:maven-artifact-ant:dependencies> namespace for the nested <dependency> elements?"

Thanks, John, for replying to my inquiry. I'm still unable to build the Mechanical Turk Requester Toolkit, but I have made significant progress.

I think I know why this may be working for you and not me.  I apologize if I was being too vague.  I am interested in creating a Native/Unmanaged/not .NET C++ application.
If I create a Managed (""CLR"") C++ application, this works fine.
Exact steps to reproduce:
- File->New Project
- Visual C++->Win32->Win 32 Console Application->OK
- In the Win32 Application Wizard hit Finish
- Select the project in Solution Explorer
- Project->Add Web Reference
- Enter the location of the WSDL (http://webservices.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/AWSSimpleQueueService.wsdl)
- Go->Add Reference
 
More info:
When I tried this in Visual C++ 2005 Express Beta 2 the ""Add Web Reference"" menu item is disabled when I'm working with a Win32 application.  Therefore, you may need to try this either in the non-express version of Visual C++ 2005, or in Visual C++ .NET 2003.
Alternatively, I've attached a project I created in the non-express version of VC++ 2005.  You can open this project in VC++ 2005 Express and see the problem.
Still more info:
Under the covers, VC++ is using the sproxy.exe tool to generate the proxy code and this is what is failing.  So if you don't want to mess with all this project stuff, you can reproduce this fairly easily with any version of VC++ (VC++ .NET 2003, VC++ 2005 Express, VC++ 2005 not-express...).

If that is the explanation then I am happy, because I have complained several times that Alexa is not returning all the unavailable products or products that have problems like ""Back Ordered"", or products that have been totally deleted from the Amazon Catalogue.
I am using the AWS links to products within the XSLT stylesheet of Elena. For apparel products. ... My links are not ASIN.
Alexa has been extremely useful, Alexa has been a Beauty and a Wonder. A very valuable Treasure in the Assets of Amazon.
Thanks for any help.

Alexa doesn't sweep and clean perfectly :
 
I moved many of my Apparel Sites from ASIN links to AWS links.
And I notice that Alexa is not sweeping and cleaning the websites in total perfection. ( The AWS links )
There are many apparel products that are unavailable, or ""out of stock"" and Alexa does not say anything.
As a result I am worried about this tool. Because many products that are unavailable continue inside my many apparel pages.

Sample Code & Libraries Articles & Tutorials and Amazon Machine Images	"Alexa doesn't sweep and clean perfectly
I wish that I am wrong but my data continues giving indication that Alexa fails finding all those garments that are ""Out of Stock"" or Unavailable.
My opinion is that Alexa ( for uncovering these unavailable items ) has been a Wonderful Tool, a Very Useful Tool for me. And I deeply thank its existence.
Alexa has been a Wonder and a Beauty. But I am lately very worried about its accuracy.
Since I moved into AWS links things seem to have changed and Alexa does not uncover all ""bad offers"", those offers without inventory.
Vicente"
Sample Code & Libraries Articles & Tutorials and Amazon Machine Images	"Alexa doesn't sweep and clean perfectly
Sorry if I am repetitive.
But Alexa is not picking the ""Out of Stock"" or ""Backordered"" items.
It is skipping over many problems and unavailable items.
Reports have almost no problems, but the websites are full of availability problems.

Ugly Tags inside Apparel Descriptions for XSLT
Something went wrong in the last day ( or last two days ) with the Product Descriptions of Many Apparel Items in the XSLT system.
For example the item B0000865Q9 gives this Ugly Text :

<FONT size=""1"">3) Why is it that other Apparel merchants like Cherokee, Merona, Xhilaration do not care about producing the middle image in XSLT.</FONT>
<FONT size=""1"">4) I hope that there are no more catastrophes of Merchants leaving Amazon like : Spiegel, Wintersilks and Venus Swimwear.</FONT>
<FONT size=""1"">5) I pray every dawn before sunrise that no more ""Excluded Merchants"" are added to the list. For my system of sales and my domain names the ""Excluded Merchants"" are a stab on my back.</FONT>
<FONT size=""1"">I hope that these critiques are taken for the benefit of the bottom line of Amazon and for the dynamism of AMZN corporation and not as an angry rant of a frustrated associate.</FONT>

Sample Code & Libraries Articles & Tutorials and Amazon Machine Images	"Can I insert XSLT inside phpBB Forum ???
Dear Friends :
I am in the last version of phpBB and working on a Forum.
I don't like the idea of placing a link to another of my domain names inside one of my phpBB posts so that the people in  a thread buy from me.
Creating an HTML page inside the Forum Domain Name in order to sell that thing that we are talking about ( and placing a link ) is also very cumbersome and leading to disorganization.
I don't want to place the ""ASIN Link"" 
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/theProductASINcode/ref=nosim/myAmazonID
because I want the image and the availability being sent from Amazon automatically as Datafeed showing the last price, image, etc ...
So that people can immediately talk about the product offered and praise or criticize it. Or even offer an alternative or better deal. !! 
Is that possible in today's phpBB technology ???
Does it require complex Mods or Hacks by experts ???
Any URL that teaches the trick ??
Do we have to wait for another phpBB Version ???
Any other Forum technology that does the trick ???
Thanks for help

HiI was trying to see if - from the latest crawl of alexa, I could obtain the date when a webpage had last changed. - Also if there is some way to tell what percentage of the content has changed?

I think you need the Crawl Operation:

Sample Code & Libraries Articles & Tutorials and Amazon Machine Images	"API not working anymore
Hi Ozorg,
I think you are experiencing a timeout bug. It is caused by poor coordination between AWS and Alexa... basically AWS times out before the Alexa search can respond. We should have it fixed in the next month or so.
In the meanwhile, you can try reducing the relevance. You will find that lower relevances time out less frequently.
Thanks."

But if Amazon can do anything, then please do it. I can not see how the present situation of disorder can benefit the customer, the buyer, Amazon or the Associate.

JCPenney inside Amazon is a total Mess :
It is almost useless to work with JCPenney offerings inside Amazon. They are fleeting creatures that live for less than one or two weeks, if you are lucky.
I know that many people will tell me that the coming Spring is the Guilty Man, and that this should always happen with the arrival of Spring. As if the slow and gradual change of Seasons was the excuse for a breakdown of law and order inside product offerings. Things need to be more planned, ordered, methodical, progressive and continuous.
I hope that something can be done. Great Technology, but lack of discipline by merchants. They just don't fill the information. Or stay out of Amazon while selling somewhere else.

Hi,Thanks for participating in the beta. First of all, we need to change the ""XML Aggregation failed"" message text. It is essentially a timeout failure. This means that at least one of the search servers did not respond within the timeout.

Whimsical Images.
Loss of Spiegel Collection
 
Hi. Look at these troubles please :
 
1)  Apparel XSLT : Many Images stop working in XSLT from one day to next. Even if the products are available within 24 hours.
For example these medium images were perfectly working and now they have stopped suddenly : 
B000121AS
B000121X8A
B0000UTLTQ
B0002LWTRY
2) The Spiegel Collection has been totally absolutely unavailable for more than one month. But XSLT continues sending information and images. It would be a good idea to give some information to Associates on what is going on. Are negotiations proceding in order to repair the Spiegel-Amazon marriage ???
3) Newport News, Carabella, Venus Swimwear, Merona, Bra Smyth, Silhouettes, and many other brands lack the middle images for a great part of their apparel products.
I know that Amazon is not guilty of recklessnes and that the brands have some responsibility in filling the Information. They should complete the data with care and love and not leave things half finished.
In Newport News there are strange tags inside the Datafeed Information for some products.  I have already pointed out that problem in past posts in this forum.
Filling the Information that is lacking would be for the benefit of everybody and of Amazon in Special. 
It would be a good idea to send the Availability Variable for ""Back Ordered Products"" with a future date when you can buy the product. Newport News and Eddie Bauer are just doing that. But we need to generalize this good idea for the other brands. So that the Associate has less work to do with the whimsicalities of ""Out of Stock""....
Thanks for any attention.

Collect Apparel Garbage - Wal Mart Example
Praise Wal Mart \!!!
I read that Wal Mart has been in a strong campaign to avoid offers to the public which are not ready available ... This is for Bricks and Mortar and also for Online Systems.
The philosophy of Wal Mart : Seriousness and Constancy in Offers. Respect for the customer or visitor.
Offering beautiful things that can't be bought tomorrow is a waste of time, for everybody but specially for the KING ( the customer ).
Offers should be constant for a rational amount of time and intermitent ""Out of Stock"" has to be avoided.
Inside Amazon :
Spiegel has been totally unavailable inside Amazon for many weeks. A Huge powerful collection has apparently quarrelled with Amazon. Is there any spat ??? ..... Is there any divorce of this happy marriage ???
But the images continue being sent by XSLT ( with unavailable of course )... this is super frustrating.
Other brands that are Increasingly Irresponsible and that tease the customer like in a strip tease are these :
Bealls Florida and JCPenney
Their items are available for less time than cakes in a kindergarden.
So it is a waste of time for Associates and visitors to fall in love with the pretty items. But it is love at first sight. Because if they wait then the item will be unavailable tomorrow.
I am a total ignorant of marketing, retailing and eTailing. But my intuition tells me that this is not right.
I get the idea that the visitor is the Guinea Pig for Marketing Studies and that Amazon Apparel becomes the kingdom of Fleeting Availabilities that become Ghost Unavailabilities.
Vanishing Ghosts of a Bewitched House.
Another complaint : big important collections lack the middle image for XSLT and for many products ... The greatest pain is Newport News, as I have posted here several times. Carabella also fails for many beautiful products.

Hi Vicente,
Where do you take users from this page? Is this a detail page or list page? Do you have button ""Buy from Amazon"" or similar on this page? Big list of sizes does look ugly and commas may be a little help in that. Perhaps better solution would be to generate dropdowns like on Amazon site and let user select and click ""buy"" button.

Elena :
Thanks for answer.
This is one of my pages which uses the stylesheet :
http://owoman.com/zSpring.htm
I want to show 8 or 10 garments per page. I would like to have a link for each garment inside the stylesheet that opens a new window when clicked.
Thanks for your wonderful help. I hope that I am not a nuissance. I am very much ""addicted"" to selling clothes. ( in 8 websites !!! ) 
I am not yet showing the ""Product Description"" ... Perhaps it can be accomodated below the Product Image.
We also need to show the merchant variable.
Thanks for any help. This has been a lot of work and I am will continue working as the clock gives the fatidic 12 tolls and the death of the year 2004.
Have a Beautiful 2005 full of Wonderful Magic Surprises.
Happy Baby 2005 \!!!

Right now any Associates can query the service by providing somebody else SubscriptionID. 
I consider that the information returned is 'kind of' confidential, and should be only available to each associate only. Can you consider in the future a way to authenticate the associate ?

We are looking at this issue -- thanks for bringing it to our attention.  We'll get back to you when we have a solution figured out.Duane at Amazon"
Sample Code & Libraries Articles & Tutorials and Amazon Machine Images	"Deleteing a queue fails
If I empty a queue immediately  after dequeing all the messages in it I get a failure saying that the queue is not empty. If I sleep for a bit and delete the queue then it works.

I'm guessing that I need to wait for at least ReadLockTimeoutSeconds after dequing the last message before I can delete it. Is that so or is there another magic number?

I can't find any reference to this in the documentation. Would it be possible to add something to cover this issue to the documentation?

If I do need to wait ReadLockTimeoutSeconds I would really like an API to retrieve this for a single queue. I know that ListMyQueues will give me this for all queues but I may have thousands of queues so that call would be expensive to make.

       John Wilson"
Sample Code & Libraries Articles & Tutorials and Amazon Machine Images	"Deleteing a queue fails
The ""magic number"" you need to wait between dequeuing the last entry and deleting the queue is 60 seconds. It's unrelated to the read-lock timeout, but rather it represents the time it takes for the change to propagate through our system.

You are right -- this quirk should definitely be documented."

        John Wilson"
Sample Code & Libraries Articles & Tutorials and Amazon Machine Images	"Control characters in messages
The REST interface to the Amazon Simple Queue Service lets you include arbitrary control characters in the message when using the enqueue operation. This causes a couple of problems

1/ if you include the NULL character (value 0) then the message is truncated at that point (there's C code behind this interface isn't there?)

2/ Other control characters are accepted OK. However when the message is read the response is not well formed XML

Point 2 is the killer. An XML document may not contain control characters other than CR, NL and HT. You can't include control characters by using &x01 or by any other trick. That just can't be in the document at all.

The result of this is that the system allows you to post messages which cannot be retrieved by software which uses XML compliant components (i.e. a normal XML parser). This is a really big problem which you have to fix ASAP.

The REST layer needs to check for control characters and reject messages containing them.

Note this is (or should be) a REST only problem. The SOAP interface is XML so your SOAP implementation will (or should) reject a SOAP document which contains illegal control characters as the XML will be non well formed.

John Wilson"
Sample Code & Libraries Articles & Tutorials and Amazon Machine Images	"Control characters in messages
There is another, related, problem....

As far as I can see the REST layer is assuming that the URL is UTF-8 encoded Unicode (this is fine and corresponds to the W3C and IETF views on encoding URIs as I understand them)

Unfortunately it does not check that the UTF-8 encoding is correct. If you supply a message which has bad UTF-8 encoding it is placed in the queue and this causes the XML produced as a result of the read operation to be corrupt (i.e. it contains the bad UTF-8 encoding)

Dave, thanks for the clarification.

The Enqueue documentation says that the QueueEntryBody must be an ""An alphanumeric string"". This seems unnecessarily restrictive (I can Base64 encode the message, of course, but I'd rather not). Can you clarify this? My tests indicate that you will accept more than alphanumeric but I'd like to know what the actual restrictions are.

Hi John,

What request did you receive this response to?  A misspelled service name in the url can cause this response.  In such a case, it's not always clear which namespace applies.

Thanks,
Duane at Amazon"
Sample Code & Libraries Articles & Tutorials and Amazon Machine Images	"ListMyQueues when there are no queues
Hi Duane,

Yes the error was a response to a mangled URL. However I would still expect the response to be in some namespace or other. You seem to be using namespaces as a versioning device for the API. I would expect you to want to version these error responses in exactly the same way as the non error responses.

If I get one of these errors I want to know if it's in a format I'm familiar with (i.e. I know about the namespace URI) or if it's a newer format in which case I need to log the fact that my software needs updating. At the moment, because there is no namespace, I can't tell if I should be able to understand the response or not. In addition these responses are undocumented as your schema only covers the namespace http://webservices.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/2004-10-14."
Sample Code & Libraries Articles & Tutorials and Amazon Machine Images	"AWIS SOAP Fix for missing parameters
Current WDSL contains bugs, and we cannot generate valid SOAP request.
Therefore, we only receive missing required argument error.

But, updated WDSL is not available yet.
We can wait official release of updated WSDL.
But, I couldn't wait and modified WSDL manufally.

I checked in Apache Axis and .NET(C#) and both worked correctly.

I'm not good at English and cannot describe properly.
So I'll show the full code related to this issue.

I'll take UrlInfo operation as a example, but this issue applies to all the operations.

[UrlInfo operation]

A SOAP request generated from current WSDL is looks like this:

<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?>
<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"" xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"" xmlns:xsd=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"">
<soap:Body>
<UrlInfo xmlns=""http://webservices.amazon.com/AWSAlexa/2004-09-15"">
<SubscriptionId>${SubscriptionId}</SubscriptionId>
<UrlInfoRequest>
<ResponseGroup>TrafficData</ResponseGroup>
<Url>www.w3c.org</Url>
</UrlInfoRequest>
</UrlInfo>
</soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>

But response from this request is rejected like this:

<Error>
<Code>AWS.MissingParameters</Code>
<Message>Your request is missing required parameters. Required parameters include Url.</Message>
</Error>

A valid request for AWIS is:

<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?>
<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"" xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"" xmlns:xsd=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"">
<soap:Body>
<UrlInfo xmlns=""http://webservices.amazon.com/AWSAlexa/2004-09-15"">
<SubscriptionId>${SubscriptionId}</SubscriptionId>
<Request>
<ResponseGroup>TrafficData</ResponseGroup>
<Url>www.w3c.org</Url>
</Request>
</UrlInfo>
</soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>

To generate this SOAP request, current WSDL should be fixed like this:

Possible FIX (1):

<xs:element name=""UrlInfo"">
<xs:complexType>
<xs:sequence>
<xs:element name=""SubscriptionId"" type=""xs:string"" minOccurs=""0""/>
<xs:element name=""Request"" type=""tns:UrlInfoRequest"" minOccurs=""0"" maxOccurs=""unbounded""/>
</xs:sequence>
</xs:complexType>

<xs:complexType name=""UrlInfoRequest"">
<xs:sequence>
<xs:element name=""ResponseGroup"" type=""xs:string"" minOccurs=""0""/>
<xs:element name=""Url"" type=""xs:string""/>
</xs:sequence>
</xs:complexType>

Possible FIX (2):

<xs:element name=""UrlInfo"">
<xs:complexType>
<xs:sequence>
<xs:element name=""SubscriptionId"" type=""xs:string"" minOccurs=""0""/>
<xs:element name=""Request"" ref=""tns:UrlInfoRequest"" minOccurs=""0"" maxOccurs=""unbounded""/>

<xs:element name=""ResponseGroup"" type=""xs:string"" minOccurs=""0""/>
<xs:element name=""Url"" type=""xs:string""/>
</xs:sequence>
</xs:complexType>
</xs:element>

If you are "".Net"" user, you may not required to modify WSDL.
I modified reference file like this:

[System.Xml.Serialization.XmlElementAttribute(""UrlInfoRequest"")] 

FIX:
[System.Xml.Serialization.XmlElementAttribute(""Request"")] 


FYI: More fix in the WSDL, see this post.

I don't blame Amazon or the AWS Team .... And this has nothing to do with the Seasons, The Fall, The Winter, the cold changing garments, etc ...
This is sheer madness and chaos !!
Perhaps this is the indiscipline of a Brand that has always been chaotic in Apparel. The champion of Anarchy and changing everything everyday.
The Spiegel Apparel brand loses images in ECS like this one :
http://xml.amazon.com/onca/xml?Service=AWSECommerceService&Operation=ItemLookup&Style=http%3A//www.gamefant.com/vico.xslt&ContentType=text/html&SubscriptionId=&ltAccess Key Removed>&ItemId=B000623G1W&IdType=ASIN&MerchantId=All&ResponseGroup=Large,VariationSummary&Version=2004-10-04
Previously the Garment Image was shown ( a Sweater ) ...
Now it is lost in ECS for XSLT.
Spiegel has always been the champion of indiscipline changing Asin number with extraordinary frequency and killing big collections for a week or fifteen days.... Later they appear with changed ASIN number and later all the resurrected collection is killed once again for days or weeks.
I am not talking about all Spiegel Products but a good percentage.
While other champions of indiscipline have been corrected and are now good kids, Spiegel seems every day worse in behaviour.
The AWS Team has done a wonderful job with ECS ... This is magic and its performance and reliability is extraordinary. But the employees of a brand can do a lot to discredit ECS by erasing the images or killing collections without any explanation.
Later the resurrection of the dead is killed once again. This is an absurd game of ""Out of Stock"" . Intermittent and Crazy !! ( Not continuous or stable )
I don't see how Amazon is benefited with this erratic behaviour.

Hi Friends :
Using the Examples that Elena kindly has made public for all of us in this thread :
Scratchpad - code samples auto generated
http://forums.prospero.com/n/mb/message.asp?webtag=am-assocdevxml&msg=6472.1&ctx=0
Then I built my own simplified XSLT sytlesheet and I published it on the same thread of the link that I posted above. It is just my reduced stylesheet version of what Elena posted.
Thinks have worked generally well. I converted many of my Apparel Pages using my reduced stylesheet. Most days the rate of failure of my XML-XSLT calls is very low 1% or 2%, but some days like today Thursday the errors are unusually High 5% to 10% of calls. 
At the same time I have been unable to find a single error in XSLT 3.0 ( for books and DVDs ) during the last three months. And I am an obsessive neurotic and compulsive checker of Datafeeds in my Pages.
Also many images are missing in several brands of Apparel. Some descriptions in Newport News Swimsuits are ""very dirty"" with tags like <li> and other tags.
I am somewhat ashamed of asking for help here, but I am forced by economic cirncunstances to work as a Consultant outside in Factories and Offices and therefore I lack time to devote to studying these things of XSLT 4.0
My Amazon revenue is not enought to justify FULL TIME.
Has someone examples of XSLT 4.0 for Apparel ??
Can we force the link to Item Datafeed  in Elena's Stylesheet sample to open in a New Window, instead of the same Window ???
And if I am calling the garment from an <iframe> tag, Can I force the link to invade all the window ??? ( Maximized Window ) instead of the datafeed appearing only inside the <iframe> ???
Can we get the availability ??? ..... Can we get the colors and sizes ???  ....  By automatic datafeed ??? 
I apologize again to all Associate and to Amazon if I appear as a parasite bloodsucker. As a sort of Apparel XSLT Dracula sucking the work and effort of others, but I really can not devote time to studying a lot of manuals and documentation. I need examples.
I love Amazon, the Apparel and the Associates. And I plan to stay here. 
Besides I am an incorrigible optimist that thinks that things ( and sales ) are going to improve a lot in the future and that we better be stubborn as mules. I am an innate believer in ""EL Dorado"" and the ""Seven Cities of Gold"" and maybe I am right !!
I also think that Amazon is going to improve the servers for Apparel XSLT 4.0 and that they are going to work so perfectly in the future as XSLT 3.0 does now for Books and DVDs, where things never fail and there is no 'throttling' for little Honeybees like me.
Thanks for any help

The alexa.com site is still using google, right?
I can't tell if I am doing something wrong (which I don't think I am), or if the search results are really going to be this bad!?!
I did really simple searches for things like ""lion king"", ""real estate"", ""online stock advice"" and all the results were complete junk.  Most of the results seem to be google directory (i.e. DMOZ) entries.  What's up with that?
If search results can be anywhere close to as relevant as those on the current Alexa.com site, then there is the opportunity for some really neat stuff to be built.  But, if the results I am seeing are the *real* results to be returned by this engine, then there is no hope.  I certainly hope it is the former ..."

Vicente to Dan :
There is a terrible issue with missing images in Apparel, Perhaps half the images are not returned by Automatic Datafeed .... Important collections like Newport News have most of the images hidden from view for ECS.
This ECS Apparel Release seems to me like a Crude Beta was forced in order to please Wall Street Investors or someone else at the top of the Chain Food.
The Price Chart for the Amazon Share is appalling :
From $64.00 to $38.54 in the last year.
Take a look at the Price Chart for a Year :

Problems building Mechanical Turk Requester Toolkit. Got following error  in connection with [generate-axis] target of build.xml script:
'The <urn:maven-artifact-ant:dependencies> type doesn't support the nested ""dependency"" element. '
My Windows 2000 system has JDK 5.0, Ant 1.6.1, JWSDP 1.6, and Axis 1.2.1 installed, with their environment variables set as per docs.
I want JAXB binding, so I first ran ant as follows:

Build failed with error: 'The <urn:maven-artifact-ant:dependencies> type doesn't support the nested ""pom"" element.'
As a workaround, I copied JAXB-related .jar files (8) to the \binding\jaxb\pom folder, which helped get me past the [prepare-jaxb] target. I've studied the build.xml and rtk-with-jaxb.pom files, and they both show nested <dependency> elements.

Thanks, John, for replying to my inquiry. I'm still unable to build the Mechanical Turk Requester Toolkit, but I have made significant progress.

I think I know why this may be working for you and not me.  I apologize if I was being too vague.  I am interested in creating a Native/Unmanaged/not .NET C++ application.
If I create a Managed (""CLR"") C++ application, this works fine.
Exact steps to reproduce:
- File->New Project
- Visual C++->Win32->Win 32 Console Application->OK
- In the Win32 Application Wizard hit Finish
- Select the project in Solution Explorer
- Project->Add Web Reference
- Enter the location of the WSDL (http://webservices.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/AWSSimpleQueueService.wsdl)
- Go->Add Reference
 
More info:
When I tried this in Visual C++ 2005 Express Beta 2 the ""Add Web Reference"" menu item is disabled when I'm working with a Win32 application.  Therefore, you may need to try this either in the non-express version of Visual C++ 2005, or in Visual C++ .NET 2003.
Alternatively, I've attached a project I created in the non-express version of VC++ 2005.  You can open this project in VC++ 2005 Express and see the problem.
Still more info:
Under the covers, VC++ is using the sproxy.exe tool to generate the proxy code and this is what is failing.  So if you don't want to mess with all this project stuff, you can reproduce this fairly easily with any version of VC++ (VC++ .NET 2003, VC++ 2005 Express, VC++ 2005 not-express...).

If that is the explanation then I am happy, because I have complained several times that Alexa is not returning all the unavailable products or products that have problems like ""Back Ordered"", or products that have been totally deleted from the Amazon Catalogue.
I am using the AWS links to products within the XSLT stylesheet of Elena. For apparel products. ... My links are not ASIN.
Alexa has been extremely useful, Alexa has been a Beauty and a Wonder. A very valuable Treasure in the Assets of Amazon.
Thanks for any help.

Alexa doesn't sweep and clean perfectly :
 
I moved many of my Apparel Sites from ASIN links to AWS links.
And I notice that Alexa is not sweeping and cleaning the websites in total perfection. ( The AWS links )
There are many apparel products that are unavailable, or ""out of stock"" and Alexa does not say anything.
As a result I am worried about this tool. Because many products that are unavailable continue inside my many apparel pages.

Sample Code & Libraries Articles & Tutorials and Amazon Machine Images	"Alexa doesn't sweep and clean perfectly
I wish that I am wrong but my data continues giving indication that Alexa fails finding all those garments that are ""Out of Stock"" or Unavailable.
My opinion is that Alexa ( for uncovering these unavailable items ) has been a Wonderful Tool, a Very Useful Tool for me. And I deeply thank its existence.
Alexa has been a Wonder and a Beauty. But I am lately very worried about its accuracy.
Since I moved into AWS links things seem to have changed and Alexa does not uncover all ""bad offers"", those offers without inventory.
Vicente"
Sample Code & Libraries Articles & Tutorials and Amazon Machine Images	"Alexa doesn't sweep and clean perfectly
Sorry if I am repetitive.
But Alexa is not picking the ""Out of Stock"" or ""Backordered"" items.
It is skipping over many problems and unavailable items.
Reports have almost no problems, but the websites are full of availability problems.

Ugly Tags inside Apparel Descriptions for XSLT
Something went wrong in the last day ( or last two days ) with the Product Descriptions of Many Apparel Items in the XSLT system.
For example the item B0000865Q9 gives this Ugly Text :

<FONT size=""1"">3) Why is it that other Apparel merchants like Cherokee, Merona, Xhilaration do not care about producing the middle image in XSLT.</FONT>
<FONT size=""1"">4) I hope that there are no more catastrophes of Merchants leaving Amazon like : Spiegel, Wintersilks and Venus Swimwear.</FONT>
<FONT size=""1"">5) I pray every dawn before sunrise that no more ""Excluded Merchants"" are added to the list. For my system of sales and my domain names the ""Excluded Merchants"" are a stab on my back.</FONT>
<FONT size=""1"">I hope that these critiques are taken for the benefit of the bottom line of Amazon and for the dynamism of AMZN corporation and not as an angry rant of a frustrated associate.</FONT>

Sample Code & Libraries Articles & Tutorials and Amazon Machine Images	"Can I insert XSLT inside phpBB Forum ???
Dear Friends :
I am in the last version of phpBB and working on a Forum.
I don't like the idea of placing a link to another of my domain names inside one of my phpBB posts so that the people in  a thread buy from me.
Creating an HTML page inside the Forum Domain Name in order to sell that thing that we are talking about ( and placing a link ) is also very cumbersome and leading to disorganization.
I don't want to place the ""ASIN Link"" 
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/theProductASINcode/ref=nosim/myAmazonID
because I want the image and the availability being sent from Amazon automatically as Datafeed showing the last price, image, etc ...
So that people can immediately talk about the product offered and praise or criticize it. Or even offer an alternative or better deal. !! 
Is that possible in today's phpBB technology ???
Does it require complex Mods or Hacks by experts ???
Any URL that teaches the trick ??
Do we have to wait for another phpBB Version ???
Any other Forum technology that does the trick ???
Thanks for help

HiI was trying to see if - from the latest crawl of alexa, I could obtain the date when a webpage had last changed. - Also if there is some way to tell what percentage of the content has changed?

I think you need the Crawl Operation:

Sample Code & Libraries Articles & Tutorials and Amazon Machine Images	"API not working anymore
Hi Ozorg,
I think you are experiencing a timeout bug. It is caused by poor coordination between AWS and Alexa... basically AWS times out before the Alexa search can respond. We should have it fixed in the next month or so.
In the meanwhile, you can try reducing the relevance. You will find that lower relevances time out less frequently.
Thanks."

But if Amazon can do anything, then please do it. I can not see how the present situation of disorder can benefit the customer, the buyer, Amazon or the Associate.

JCPenney inside Amazon is a total Mess :
It is almost useless to work with JCPenney offerings inside Amazon. They are fleeting creatures that live for less than one or two weeks, if you are lucky.
I know that many people will tell me that the coming Spring is the Guilty Man, and that this should always happen with the arrival of Spring. As if the slow and gradual change of Seasons was the excuse for a breakdown of law and order inside product offerings. Things need to be more planned, ordered, methodical, progressive and continuous.
I hope that something can be done. Great Technology, but lack of discipline by merchants. They just don't fill the information. Or stay out of Amazon while selling somewhere else.

Hi,Thanks for participating in the beta. First of all, we need to change the ""XML Aggregation failed"" message text. It is essentially a timeout failure. This means that at least one of the search servers did not respond within the timeout.

Whimsical Images.
Loss of Spiegel Collection
 
Hi. Look at these troubles please :
 
1)  Apparel XSLT : Many Images stop working in XSLT from one day to next. Even if the products are available within 24 hours.
For example these medium images were perfectly working and now they have stopped suddenly : 
B000121AS
B000121X8A
B0000UTLTQ
B0002LWTRY
2) The Spiegel Collection has been totally absolutely unavailable for more than one month. But XSLT continues sending information and images. It would be a good idea to give some information to Associates on what is going on. Are negotiations proceding in order to repair the Spiegel-Amazon marriage ???
3) Newport News, Carabella, Venus Swimwear, Merona, Bra Smyth, Silhouettes, and many other brands lack the middle images for a great part of their apparel products.
I know that Amazon is not guilty of recklessnes and that the brands have some responsibility in filling the Information. They should complete the data with care and love and not leave things half finished.
In Newport News there are strange tags inside the Datafeed Information for some products.  I have already pointed out that problem in past posts in this forum.
Filling the Information that is lacking would be for the benefit of everybody and of Amazon in Special. 
It would be a good idea to send the Availability Variable for ""Back Ordered Products"" with a future date when you can buy the product. Newport News and Eddie Bauer are just doing that. But we need to generalize this good idea for the other brands. So that the Associate has less work to do with the whimsicalities of ""Out of Stock""....
Thanks for any attention.

Collect Apparel Garbage - Wal Mart Example
Praise Wal Mart \!!!
I read that Wal Mart has been in a strong campaign to avoid offers to the public which are not ready available ... This is for Bricks and Mortar and also for Online Systems.
The philosophy of Wal Mart : Seriousness and Constancy in Offers. Respect for the customer or visitor.
Offering beautiful things that can't be bought tomorrow is a waste of time, for everybody but specially for the KING ( the customer ).
Offers should be constant for a rational amount of time and intermitent ""Out of Stock"" has to be avoided.
Inside Amazon :
Spiegel has been totally unavailable inside Amazon for many weeks. A Huge powerful collection has apparently quarrelled with Amazon. Is there any spat ??? ..... Is there any divorce of this happy marriage ???
But the images continue being sent by XSLT ( with unavailable of course )... this is super frustrating.
Other brands that are Increasingly Irresponsible and that tease the customer like in a strip tease are these :
Bealls Florida and JCPenney
Their items are available for less time than cakes in a kindergarden.
So it is a waste of time for Associates and visitors to fall in love with the pretty items. But it is love at first sight. Because if they wait then the item will be unavailable tomorrow.
I am a total ignorant of marketing, retailing and eTailing. But my intuition tells me that this is not right.
I get the idea that the visitor is the Guinea Pig for Marketing Studies and that Amazon Apparel becomes the kingdom of Fleeting Availabilities that become Ghost Unavailabilities.
Vanishing Ghosts of a Bewitched House.
Another complaint : big important collections lack the middle image for XSLT and for many products ... The greatest pain is Newport News, as I have posted here several times. Carabella also fails for many beautiful products.

Hi Vicente,
Where do you take users from this page? Is this a detail page or list page? Do you have button ""Buy from Amazon"" or similar on this page? Big list of sizes does look ugly and commas may be a little help in that. Perhaps better solution would be to generate dropdowns like on Amazon site and let user select and click ""buy"" button.

Elena :
Thanks for answer.
This is one of my pages which uses the stylesheet :
http://owoman.com/zSpring.htm
I want to show 8 or 10 garments per page. I would like to have a link for each garment inside the stylesheet that opens a new window when clicked.
Thanks for your wonderful help. I hope that I am not a nuissance. I am very much ""addicted"" to selling clothes. ( in 8 websites !!! ) 
I am not yet showing the ""Product Description"" ... Perhaps it can be accomodated below the Product Image.
We also need to show the merchant variable.
Thanks for any help. This has been a lot of work and I am will continue working as the clock gives the fatidic 12 tolls and the death of the year 2004.
Have a Beautiful 2005 full of Wonderful Magic Surprises.
Happy Baby 2005 \!!!

ECS and AWS 4 are Great Feats !! 
I am in Apparel REST / XSLT 
Sincerely ... I didn't think that this was going to work so early and with such reliability and power.
I expected millions of troubles, errors, downs and downfalls. I am surprised to see myself in Apparel XSLT and satisfied with the performance.
Special Thanks to Elena, Laura and Jeff.
Special Thanks to Fumiaki in Japan. He was a Great Help and took us on the first practical tour of AWS 4 with easy working examples.
Thanks to Elena for easy, practical, short examples of Great Power. I have migrated according to the stylesheets that she had prepared.
Those sizes and colors in automatic datafeed are important so that we don't waste time offering a lot of products that have no sizes or colors, or that have lost them and are close to ""Out of Order"" and ""No longer in our Catalogue"" ...
Thanks ... Thanks ... Thanks ...
And have a prosperous year 2005 with excellent Health and your Usual Youthful Zest.

<FONT face=""Times New Roman,Times,Serif"" size=""3"">Next Step : Sizes and Colors</FONT>
The next step would be to obtain one string for the sizes like this one :

or at least this one :
<FONT face=""Times New Roman,Times,Serif"" color=""blue"" size=""3"">Sizes : Small, Medium, Large, X-Large, 1X, 2X, 3X.</FONT>
And a string of Colors, as well, like this one :

It would be wonderful to have these sizes and colors in horizontal strings like the ones that I just wrote above ( in blue color ) and without the hassle of vertical displays or color gifs. Horizontal is much better than vertical ( waste of space ! )....

And there are many descriptions of size and color for each ASIN ( having a different ASIN each color and size )
These seem to be the ""children"" of the ""parent"" garment, each one given with a single Size and single Color ( for each one of the Regular Sizes, X Sizes, W Sizes, Tall Sizes, etc .... )
This seems very confusing, very long and very VECTORIAL. ( vectors or arrays )
How do I transform the vector of sizes and colors into a single string for sizes and a single string for colors ???
Another missing element is the description of the Garment, which is not always given in the ""Feature"" element ( as given by Elena )

Thanks for your post and for the many benefits that most Associates have derived from your presence in the AWS Team.
I took my first Apparel XSLT stylesheet from your first XSLT publication in this Forum. And I modified it. I am deeply indebted for your work and kindness.
I completely translated my 8 websites of Apparel to your stylesheet and system.
However I have never been able to obtain the Availability, Color and Sizes.
I want to obtain the General Availability of the Parent Garment.
In the example that I gave :
<SPAN>http://xml.amazon.com/onca/xml?Service=AWSECommerceService&Operation=ItemLookup&Style=http%3A//www.gamefant.com/cavail.xslt&ContentType=text/html&SubscriptionId=&ltAccess Key Removed>&ItemId=B0001UYXB6&IdType=ASIN&MerchantId=All&ResponseGroup=Large,Variations&Version=2004-10-04</SPAN>
The availability is this :
Availability: <SPAN>Usually ships in 1-2 business</SPAN>
<SPAN>I don't want the availability for each size or color. Just the General Availability for all the garment.</SPAN>
<SPAN>I don't want to see the</SPAN>
<SPAN> shipping date and pricing chart </SPAN>
<SPAN>or any of its members.</SPAN>
<SPAN>I want to obtain the string of colors and the string of Sizes. But that is asking too much and you all ( in the AWS Team ) should be very excited with the coming of Santa.</SPAN>
<SPAN>Having just the Availability for the parent product would be a Great Leap Forward ( Mao Tse Tung style )..... for me and many other Associates that have benefited from your nobility and kindness.</SPAN>
<SPAN>In the first post of this thread the Availability instructions that don't work are colored in red. ( two different paragraphs )</SPAN>

I wonder if any associate has advanced to this point in Apparel XSLT and can lend a helping hand to many little associates like me, that can't give themselves the luxury of converting Amazon Apparel into a full programming job.
Thanks to any noble and kind soul that gives us some help or hint. We can continue the research if someone points out the instructions in XSLT stylesheets and the ""Response Groups"" that make this feat possible.

Sorry I missed the earlier thread. I think this has something to do with the mode parameter. There are two modes (they will be response groups in a later release.) The modes are general and all. One of them gives you the categories in the node and the other gives you the listings in the node.
Let me know if that doesn't do it."
Sample Code & Libraries Articles & Tutorials and Amazon Machine Images	"AWIS Code Samples Here
Thank you for the replyIt seems that ""Mode"" is nothing to do with this case.Because what I have pointed out is about ""Categories"", and both modes contain it.Categories: the categories in the nodeGeneral: the listings in the node.[Mode=general]Browse/AttributionBrowse/CategoriesBrowse/General[Mode=all]Browse/AttributionBrowse/CategoriesBrowse/MostPopularI have not mentioned about NavigableUrl such asGeneral/Links/Link/TitleMostPopular/Links/Link/TitleThis type of link works fine with the current AWIS.What I have pointed out is subcategory links generated by the XSLT.I have taken your sample XSLT file for example, but most stylesheets may face the same trouble.Though you may easily understand the trouble by seeing a HTML source,here is my supplement.This is a generated link but ""Path"" parameter value is ""/Arts"" which is not a valid path.Arts</a' target='_blank'>http://aws-beta.amazon.com/...&Path=/Arts&..."">Arts</a</a>>This link is a expected one. ""Path"" parameter value is correctly ""Top/Arts"".Arts</a' target='_blank'>http://aws-beta.amazon.com/...&Path=Top/Arts&..."">Arts</a</a>>But with a current AWIS response, it is impossible(at least with easy way) to generate correct ""Path"" parameter.To generate a correct parameter, we(XSLT) need to know a current category(""Top"" in this case).With the previous version(behavior) of AWIS, it was possible, because request parameters(see below) had been retured. This means that ""Browse"" response group included ""Request"" response group.A ""Path"" parameter value consists of two parts, path to the current category and subcategory title.Example A)Current category path: TopSubcategory: ArtsExample B)Current category path: Top/ArtsSubcategory: Art_HistoryWith this two information, we can construct ""Path"" parameters.Example A) Path=Top/ArtsExample B) Path=Top/Arts/Art_historyIn general, Path=$currentCategoryPath/$subcategoryTitleBut current category path cannot be obtained, because following request parameters are no longer returned from the AWIS./CategoryResponse/OperationRequest/Arguments/Argument[@Name='Path']/@ValueOn the other hand, subcategory title can be obtained from this./CategoryResponse/CategoryResult/Alexa/Browse/Categories/CategoryData/TitleAs a result, the XSLT generates an unexpected ""Path"" parameter.[With current AWIS]$currentCategoryPath = '' (empty)$subcategoryTitle = 'Art_History'Path = '/Art_history'[Expected]$currentCategoryPath = 'Top/Arts'$subcategoryTitle = 'Art_History'Path = 'Top/Arts/Art_history'I believe that most XSLT stylesheets construct their ""Path"" parameters by the same way, like your sample.http://client.alexa.com/awis/xsl/ExampleBrowse.xslA fundamental cause is in the request validator of the AWIS, I guess.If the validator accepts ""ResponseGroup=Browse,Request"", which may not conflict with the AWIS  specification, your XSLT stylesheet would be working again.takeuma"

Ok. ECS is a Great Thing and is working very beautifully at excellent speed. It is a wonder and a miracle. !
The AWS Team has been very responsive to my complaints and they have done an excellent job of fine tuning XSLT for Apparel ECS. Excellent serving of Datafeeds ""at the speed of light"" .... Errors have been reduced to Zero or are negligible and no longer a cause of worry.
But there is a management problem. Not a technical problem but a problem of controlling some brands of Apparel Items.
Some images are still missing for XSLT  ..... I use the Medium Size Image.
This is extremely painful for the Brand Newport News of Apparel.
Since these items are of extraordinary importance and acceptance by the public ( and in this sales season !! ) ..... It is a pain and a waste of time to find that many lack an image.
Something failed in the necessary preparations .... and Amazon and Newport News are going to feel that Associates are not going to portray or to underline the importance of fine garments that are extraordinarily attractive for the public.

Sounds like Alexa is a meta search engine, forwarding it's search queries to real search engines. This way it takes some time to get the results. The second time it goes much faster, because the result will already be in it's cache."

Hi Ozorg,
Thank you for digging in, using the services and providing feedback. We still have lots of work to do.
The Alexa Search has the most work left to do. It is slow, it provides unusual results, and it is experiencing timeout problems. All of these problems can and will be resolved with time. Regarding the count, be sure to capitalize the ""C"" in Count.
And, yes, we are not a meta engine. The search is based on our crawl index, which can sometimes include crawls of other search engine pages. I'll look into your other issue with the URL Info Related response group. Sounds like a bug.

If I empty a queue immediately  after dequeing all the messages in it I get a failure saying that the queue is not empty. If I sleep for a bit and delete the queue then it works.

I'm guessing that I need to wait for at least ReadLockTimeoutSeconds after dequing the last message before I can delete it. Is that so or is there another magic number?

I can't find any reference to this in the documentation. Would it be possible to add something to cover this issue to the documentation?

If I do need to wait ReadLockTimeoutSeconds I would really like an API to retrieve this for a single queue. I know that ListMyQueues will give me this for all queues but I may have thousands of queues so that call would be expensive to make.

Sample Code & Libraries Articles & Tutorials and Amazon Machine Images	"Deleteing a queue fails
The ""magic number"" you need to wait between dequeuing the last entry and deleting the queue is 60 seconds. It's unrelated to the read-lock timeout, but rather it represents the time it takes for the change to propagate through our system.

You are right -- this quirk should definitely be documented."

        John Wilson"
Sample Code & Libraries Articles & Tutorials and Amazon Machine Images	"Control characters in messages
The REST interface to the Amazon Simple Queue Service lets you include arbitrary control characters in the message when using the enqueue operation. This causes a couple of problems

1/ if you include the NULL character (value 0) then the message is truncated at that point (there's C code behind this interface isn't there?)

2/ Other control characters are accepted OK. However when the message is read the response is not well formed XML

Point 2 is the killer. An XML document may not contain control characters other than CR, NL and HT. You can't include control characters by using &x01 or by any other trick. That just can't be in the document at all.

The result of this is that the system allows you to post messages which cannot be retrieved by software which uses XML compliant components (i.e. a normal XML parser). This is a really big problem which you have to fix ASAP.

The REST layer needs to check for control characters and reject messages containing them.

Note this is (or should be) a REST only problem. The SOAP interface is XML so your SOAP implementation will (or should) reject a SOAP document which contains illegal control characters as the XML will be non well formed.

John Wilson"
Sample Code & Libraries Articles & Tutorials and Amazon Machine Images	"Control characters in messages
There is another, related, problem....

As far as I can see the REST layer is assuming that the URL is UTF-8 encoded Unicode (this is fine and corresponds to the W3C and IETF views on encoding URIs as I understand them)

Unfortunately it does not check that the UTF-8 encoding is correct. If you supply a message which has bad UTF-8 encoding it is placed in the queue and this causes the XML produced as a result of the read operation to be corrupt (i.e. it contains the bad UTF-8 encoding)

Hi Duane,

Yes the error was a response to a mangled URL. However I would still expect the response to be in some namespace or other. You seem to be using namespaces as a versioning device for the API. I would expect you to want to version these error responses in exactly the same way as the non error responses.

If I get one of these errors I want to know if it's in a format I'm familiar with (i.e. I know about the namespace URI) or if it's a newer format in which case I need to log the fact that my software needs updating. At the moment, because there is no namespace, I can't tell if I should be able to understand the response or not.

<FONT face=""Times New Roman,Times,Serif"" size=3>Spiegel Apparel Chaos and Losing Images in ECS</FONT>
<FONT face=""Times New Roman"" size=3>Losing the ECS Medium Image after it existed.</FONT>
I don't blame Amazon or the AWS Team .... And this has nothing to do with the Seasons, The Fall, The Winter, the cold changing garments, etc ...
This is sheer madness and chaos !!
Perhaps this is the indiscipline of a Brand that has always been chaotic in Apparel. The champion of Anarchy and changing everything everyday.
The Spiegel Apparel brand loses images in ECS like this one :
http://xml.amazon.com/onca/xml?Service=AWSECommerceService&Operation=ItemLookup&Style=http%3A//www.gamefant.com/vico.xslt&ContentType=text/html&SubscriptionId=&ltAccess Key Removed>&ItemId=B000623G1W&IdType=ASIN&MerchantId=All&ResponseGroup=Large,VariationSummary&Version=2004-10-04
Previously the Garment Image was shown ( a Sweater ) ...
Now it is lost in ECS for XSLT.
Spiegel has always been the champion of indiscipline changing Asin number with extraordinary frequency and killing big collections for a week or fifteen days.... Later they appear with changed ASIN number and later all the resurrected collection is killed once again for days or weeks.
I am not talking about all Spiegel Products but a good percentage.
While other champions of indiscipline have been corrected and are now good kids, Spiegel seems every day worse in behaviour.
The AWS Team has done a wonderful job with ECS ... This is magic and its performance and reliability is extraordinary. But the employees of a brand can do a lot to discredit ECS by erasing the images or killing collections without any explanation.
Later the resurrection of the dead is killed once again. This is an absurd game of ""Out of Stock"" . Intermittent and Crazy !! ( Not continuous or stable )
I don't see how Amazon is benefited with this erratic behaviour.

I forgot to say that I have many more examples of Spiegel Products losing their images for ECS.
So instead of progress for the Spiegel Brand we see many steps backwards for ECS and XSLT.
Previously all Spiegel Products had images. Now many have lost it.

This is very grave dear friends :
Spiegel erased hundreds of products that had ECS XSLT images.
I use the Medium XSLT image in my AMZN Apparel Pages.
Those products have been erased and resurrected many times and many often.
Now the resurrection occurs without ECS XSLT Images.
Spiegel was a model of having good ECS XSLT Images.
Now this is the Number One Delinquent Apparel Brand.
First in Chaos changing everything everyday.
No relation to the cold, the Fall, the Winter, etc ....
This is just Disorder and Indiscipline.
I have dozens of examples of this Madness. For the  Medium XSLT image in my AMZN Apparel Pages.

Hi Friends :
Using the Examples that Elena kindly has made public for all of us in this thread :
Scratchpad - code samples auto generated
http://forums.prospero.com/n/mb/message.asp?webtag=am-assocdevxml&msg=6472.1&ctx=0
Then I built my own simplified XSLT sytlesheet and I published it on the same thread of the link that I posted above. It is just my reduced stylesheet version of what Elena posted.
Thinks have worked generally well. I converted many of my Apparel Pages using my reduced stylesheet. Most days the rate of failure of my XML-XSLT calls is very low 1% or 2%, but some days like today Thursday the errors are unusually High 5% to 10% of calls. 
At the same time I have been unable to find a single error in XSLT 3.0 ( for books and DVDs ) during the last three months. And I am an obsessive neurotic and compulsive checker of Datafeeds in my Pages.
Also many images are missing in several brands of Apparel. Some descriptions in Newport News Swimsuits are ""very dirty"" with tags like <li> and other tags.
I am somewhat ashamed of asking for help here, but I am forced by economic cirncunstances to work as a Consultant outside in Factories and Offices and therefore I lack time to devote to studying these things of XSLT 4.0
My Amazon revenue is not enought to justify FULL TIME.
Has someone examples of XSLT 4.0 for Apparel ??
Can we force the link to Item Datafeed  in Elena's Stylesheet sample to open in a New Window, instead of the same Window ???
And if I am calling the garment from an <iframe> tag, Can I force the link to invade all the window ??? ( Maximized Window ) instead of the datafeed appearing only inside the <iframe> ???
Can we get the availability ??? ..... Can we get the colors and sizes ???  ....  By automatic datafeed ??? 
I apologize again to all Associate and to Amazon if I appear as a parasite bloodsucker. As a sort of Apparel XSLT Dracula sucking the work and effort of others, but I really can not devote time to studying a lot of manuals and documentation. I need examples.
I love Amazon, the Apparel and the Associates. And I plan to stay here. 
Besides I am an incorrigible optimist that thinks that things ( and sales ) are going to improve a lot in the future and that we better be stubborn as mules. I am an innate believer in ""EL Dorado"" and the ""Seven Cities of Gold"" and maybe I am right !!
I also think that Amazon is going to improve the servers for Apparel XSLT 4.0 and that they are going to work so perfectly in the future as XSLT 3.0 does now for Books and DVDs, where things never fail and there is no 'throttling' for little Honeybees like me.
Thanks for any help

Vicente to Dan :
There is a terrible issue with missing images in Apparel, Perhaps half the images are not returned by Automatic Datafeed .... Important collections like Newport News have most of the images hidden from view for ECS.
This ECS Apparel Release seems to me like a Crude Beta was forced in order to please Wall Street Investors or someone else at the top of the Chain Food.
The Price Chart for the Amazon Share is appalling :
From $64.00 to $38.54 in the last year.
Take a look at the Price Chart for a Year :

Hello Forum,
Need help with some architectural and fundamentals on AWS. We are planning to launch our project on AWS and part of the requirement is to create CFTs for security purposes. Not going into the details, here are the problems that we are trying to resolve and need inputs from pundits/gurus
As part of the implementation, we have 5 windows servers on which IBM software will be installed and another windows server with SQL server installed or AWS RDS server (we are waiting on the vendor to confirm)
We need to create CFTs for each EC2 instance and provide it to the client IT in order to fulfill the security scan requirements. For building the CFTs I was given 2 approaches
1. Build the EC2 windows servers an then create the CFT and
2. Build the server, install the software and configure, create AMI of the instance and then build the CFT.
Can you let me know what is the optimal approach to take knowing that we are not planning to build any new instances all we need are prod and non-prod with HA.
Hope this information suffices to provide a high level approach.

I'm trying to script a simple workflow where I start and instance and then associate an elastic IP with that instance.  I have set up the EC2 command line tools and can successfully accomplish these tasks using the tools if I open a command window and run the tools separately in the CMD window.I now want to put these commands in a BAT file and have them run sequentially (separated by a TIMEOUT command to wait a few minutes between starting the instance and associating the EIP), but have not been successful with this.The issue is that when I launch my BAT file as soon as the first command runs (ec2-start-instances), the CMD window closes and does not run the subsequent commands.The first tool does in fact run (if I check the AWS console my instance is started).  Typically, I can even see the tool feedback (e.g., INSTANCE i-abcd1234 stopped running) flash in the command window an instant before it closes.Here's the contents of my BAT file (with paths, instance names, etc. changed):ec2-start-instances -C C:\....abc123.pem -K C:\....abc123.pem i-abcd1234timeout 180ec2-associate-address -C C:\....abc123.pem -K C:\....abc123.pem 0.0.0.0 -i i-abcd1234PAUSEI have tried this on two separate machines, one Windows 7 and one Windows Server 2008 virtual machine, and have gotten the same exact results.  I am running these tools as a user who is added to the Administrators group (but not the built-in Administrator account).  I also noticed that when I successfully run the commands in the CMD window I open manually the title bar reads ""Administrator: c:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe"" but when the BAT file opens the CMD window the title bar reads simply ""C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe""I'm passing the paths to the key/certificate rather than using environment variables since I will be managing several Amazon accounts.I am ideally looking not just for a workaround, but hopefully an explanation as to why things are different run from the BAT file.Thanks for any help you can provide!!!"

If I click view detail I get the message:

I have exactly the same problem as described here. I have tried changing the region however the error persists. Did you ever resolve it?"
Sample Code & Libraries Articles & Tutorials and Amazon Machine Images	"Re: Petboard: Exception running setup
Found the following solution in another thread:

      The location constraint is a required field for all regions except for us-east-1. The 
      PutBucketRequest has a few ways of specifying this value. The easiest way do do
      that is set UseClientRegion to true which means the SDK will set the location
      constraint to whatever region the S3 client is configured for.

So I tried this by adding the line:

      putBucketRequest.UseClientRegion = true;

just after the creation of the new PutBucketRequest object in BucketHelper.cs. This seems to have fixed the problem."

Hi Peter,

I am trying to use libsdb on Fedora (17). I managed to compile and install it after adding ""-lcrypto"" to LIB_LIBRARIES variable in mk/headers.mk. However, the test program as well as any program written as suggested in the README gave a segmentation fault. After some digging, I figured out that the problem might be that the curl_global_init is done (in sdb.c) with CURL_GLOBAL_NONE which does not initialize SSL handling in cURL. I changed that initialization to CURL_GLOBAL_ALL. With libsdb thus built, the test program as well as other programs started working fine.

If this is fine, could you please update the main package on Amazon site?

Sample Code & Libraries Articles & Tutorials and Amazon Machine Images	"Re: Amazon Web Services: Overview of Security Processes
John,I think that AWS is considering a ""backup"" as a physically separate, point-in-time copy of the data stored in S3, EBS, etc. For example, if you have an application that writes garbage data to your EBS or S3 you will have 2 perfectly replicated copies of that garbage. But you won't have a ""good"" backup unless, for example, you made an EBS snapshot to S3 at a specific point-in-time that has not been altered by your applications.

Sample Code & Libraries Articles & Tutorials and Amazon Machine Images	"Re: Amazon Web Services: Overview of Security Processes
Hi All, I am wondering whether it is possible to have a token based security system. The reason I ask is if you have a Rich Client like AIR/Flex, you don't necessarily want files to be uploaded/downloaded by the user through your mid tier, but directly to S3, or perhaps be able to run a selection of authenticated queries via SimpleDB.As I am not aware of a token based system, the only way to proceed as is, is with a very limited approach of securing buckets, and then providing private access keys to users. This is obviously not the most ideal approach.Without passing data through a mid-tier other than possibly authenticating with a username/password, how would you go about authenticating and providing access to only parts of a bucket, or to provide limited functionality within the bucket? I have blogged about this at <span style=""color: #003399"">http://swarmcomputing.blogspot.com/2010/03/security-in-cloud-avoiding-equivalent.html</span>I would love to hear what people have to say about the matter."

I generated the signature with PHP5 this way (assume $policy is filled in, and $secretkey is the secret key):$signature = base64_encode(hash_hmac('sha1', $policy, $secretkey, TRUE));It took a while to figure that out.If you're using PHP4, I found a solution here:http://blog.raamdev.com/2008/05/03/amazon-s3-hmac-signatures-without-pear-or-php5/"

Forgot to mention, $policy should be base 64 encoded before signing, like the other examples above."
Sample Code & Libraries Articles & Tutorials and Amazon Machine Images	"Re: Browser Uploads to S3 using HTML POST Forms
To those people who reported problems generating a signature value using the example Java code in this article, can you confirm whether or not the calculated signature worked when you attempt to upload a file?There can be subtle differences between policy documents generated by different code, and these differences will produce entirely different signature values. For example, something as simple as an extra space or newline character will lead to a different signature value, even though the important parts of the policy document are identical.I am interested to know whether the example Java code fails in some cases, or whether it just happens to produce different signature values that still work when you actually submit the form?"
Sample Code & Libraries Articles & Tutorials and Amazon Machine Images	"Re: Browser Uploads to S3 using HTML POST Forms
The sample code, in Perl:use MIME::Base64 qw( encode_base64 );
use Digest::HMAC_SHA1 qw( hmac_sha1 );
 
my $policy    = encode_base64($policy_document);
$policy       =~ tr{\n}\{}d ;   # remove end-of-lines, if any
my $signature = encode_base64(hmac_sha1($policy, $key));
$signature    =~ tr{\n}\{}d; # remove end-of-lines, if any
End-of-line removal is something I've seen in the Java and Ruby examples, but not in Python's. Is there any specific reason?"
Sample Code & Libraries Articles & Tutorials and Amazon Machine Images	"Re: Browser Uploads to S3 using HTML POST Forms
It is only necessary to remove newline characters if your Base64 implementation introduces them when encoding data. Some implementations add newlines to keep text lines short, others don't. Most Base64 decoders can cope with either version, but AWS doesn't like the extra newlines."

Is there anyway to encrypt the files as they are sent to S3?"
Sample Code & Libraries Articles & Tutorials and Amazon Machine Images	"Re: Browser Uploads to S3 using HTML POST Forms
No, files are uploaded by the browser as-is, you cannot manipulate them in any way."
Sample Code & Libraries Articles & Tutorials and Amazon Machine Images	"Re: Browser Uploads to S3 using HTML POST Forms
Bummer. And thanks for the reply!"
Sample Code & Libraries Articles & Tutorials and Amazon Machine Images	"Re: Browser Uploads to S3 using HTML POST Forms
If it is vital for you to encrypt uploaded files before they are stored in S3, you could use a browser applet application such as my own Cockpit Lite. This would require supporting software on both the server- and client-side to emulate the anonymous upload functionality that Amazon's browser uploads already provides, but it is possible and would give you complete control over the upload.PM me if you are interested in discussing this further -- it's a bit off-topic for this forum."

Hi ashiv, I am also facing the same problem in java . If you have found the solution please let me know . regards'Dmitri"
Sample Code & Libraries Articles & Tutorials and Amazon Machine Images	"Re: SignatureDoesNotMatch error while uploading file......
Make sure that your policy document exactly matches the contents of your HTML form fields. If the policy document has different values from the HTML form, or if the policy is missing a field that is defined in the form, the signature generated from the policy will be invalid.Unfortunately it can be hard to work out which values are incorrect because the error message from AWS doesn't give any detail. Look carefully at every field in your HTML form and make sure there is a corresponding field with the appropriate value in the policy document.For example, in ashiv's HTML form the fields ""success_action_redirect"" and ""acl"" have different values than those in the policy document."

Thanks Jboboli for suggesting the fix for Base64 encoding of policies in Java on the Windows platform. I have updated the code in the article to include this fix."

I understand everything up to the Ruby/Java/Python part. I am also getting the ""SignatureDoesNotMatch"" error.I have no idea how to implement that Java code or where to put it or why. If someone could run through that part like they are talking to a baby... who had a working computer and an Amazon S3 account... that would be great!"
Sample Code & Libraries Articles & Tutorials and Amazon Machine Images	"Re: How to Implement the Code...
The code examples show how to generate the policy and signature values you need to include in the HTML form. In the POST form template near the beginning of the article there are some capitalised values you need to replace. These values include YOUR_POLICY_DOCUMENT_BASE64_ENCODED and YOUR_CALCULATED_SIGNATURE, which are place holders for the generated policy and signature values respectively.I have attached a very primitive Java class that pulls everything together. If you compile and run this code, it will print out an HTML document that contains an S3 POST form. Once you have edited this code to include your own AWS credentials, policy document and HTML template values, it should generate usable upload forms.Good luck!James"

I still don't understand what program you can use with that code. Can I place that into Dreamweaver and save it as ""file.java"" or ""file.class"" or do I have to use a special program? I don't know anything about java so I don't know what file extensions and programs I need to use to handle the java code. And just to make sure I'm clear on this, that java code is just to help generate the base64 encoding, right? Those specific lines code do not need to be included in the html document except for the encoding it generates?Sorry to keep bothering about this but I'm so close to making this work and this code is the only thing I'm stuck on!Thanks!"
Sample Code & Libraries Articles & Tutorials and Amazon Machine Images	"Re: How to Implement the Code...
You will need to download Sun's Java software development kit to compile and run the Java code. To make the process easier, you may prefer to use a development environment like Eclipse or NetBeans.The Java code uses cryptographic tools to calculate a signature value that is unique to your policy document and AWS credentials, as well as base64-encoding this value. Once the values have been generated, you include them in the HTML document. You do not need to include the Java code that created them.Getting started with Java, Ruby or Python is too big a topic for this forum but you should be able to find many resources on the 'net to help you learn."
Sample Code & Libraries Articles & Tutorials and Amazon Machine Images	"Re: How to Implement the Code...
Hopefully this will be my last post and I apologize in advance:I used a program to convert my policy document to a base64 encoded document.Then I used the encoded policy and converted that into HMAC-SHA1, using my unencoded AWS Secret Key as the key. For some reason I am still getting the same error that says my signature does not match. Am I doing something out of order or is my encoding bad?If emailing me will be easier to discuss this, I would really appreciate it but I'll understand if it's too much trouble.

Hi James,Thanks for <span style=""font-size: x-small"">S3PostFormBuilder.java source</span>. I  could run this code, without any errors and able to upload files into AS3 account.However, I have a following query  with respect to view the  uploaded file 1. I could see when I access the public-read acl file through browser URL, with the following format:http://s3.amazonaws.com/<bucket>/<object>2. But, I am facing the problem in order to access the private acl file using browser URL with the above format by adding respective AWSAccessKeyId, Expires & Signature (These three parameters I have used same as specified in policy file).

The URL to access private S3 objects must be generated using a whole other request signing algorithm, you cannot use the same signature value as the one in the HTML POST form.If you need to generate URLs to expose your private objects, look for the S3 documentation about ""Signed URLs"" for instructions.The easiest thing would be to find an S3 client tool that is able to generate signed URLs. My Cockpit Java applet can do this, as can some other clients. Cockpit is free and is available here: http://jets3t.s3.amazonaws.com/applications/cockpit.html"

I believe the issue is policy related indeed. I believe that without a policy validator that could serve coders from many languages, i.e. .net, ruby, php, flash a great deal of time is wasted on Amazon support, forums, etc.

Imagine coding without a debugger. We'd still be in the year 1981. Imagine web dev sans firebug. Validation makes everybody happy. The amazon online policy generator was a step in the right direction but it would be great if they had a secure online utility so those poor 403 victims could quickly get to the root of the issue as everytime I get a 403 I hear boss tell me, ""What we have here is a fayyylyur to koomyooonicayt!""

The Open Virtualization Format looks promising and is already supported by VMware and VirtualBox. It would be fantastic if there was a migration tool for compatible (ie: Xen enabled) ovf VMs to ec2 AMI format.

Sample Code & Libraries Articles & Tutorials and Amazon Machine Images	"Re: any plans to support OVF ?
I'd be very interested in this from an enterprise point of view.  I work for SAP and many of my customers that are looking to cloud (public, private, external) are all worried that they will get locked in.  This could go a long way towards providing that portability that many considering cloud could use to ensure that there is a standard migration path between the different cloud providers."
Sample Code & Libraries Articles & Tutorials and Amazon Machine Images	"Re: any plans to support OVF ?
To answer this question, one might put oneself in Amazon's position as a thought experiment.
 AWS is a market-segment leader -- retail public cloud computing-- with a proprietary format (AMI).  In retail business, customers are very fickle and panicky. In subscription business, costs of subscriber-acquisition dominate costs of subscriber-retention. Since AWS is doing both, it is very important for AWS to have natural barriers against subscriber defections over the whims-du-jour of retail. AMI is a unique technical solution to a unique AWS business problem. AWS will rely on the larger ecosystem to provide instance-packaging solutions (e.g. BitRock, rPath, JumpBox, consultants & integrators), and let them worry about harmonizing the wider industry bloom of instance-formats. AWS will implement OVF support when it impacts AWS subscriptions, and not a second before that. For now, AWS is focused on retail execution and subscriber acquisition, and have built a formidable market position."

Firstly, great article.  I got this up and running quickly with no problems.  But, to follow up on this, simple tomcat applications with no backing database are rare.  I would like to know a few things:1.  Can I deploy to an AMI other than the default Tomcat Cluster?  An AMI that has both Tomcat and mysql for example?2.  Can I use the toolkit to take an existing instance, add additional applications (such as kettle or a vpn utility for example) to it,  bundle it and deploy it to s3?3. You don't elaborate much on EBS view, and there is not much in the help docs.  The best description of EBS is that it is like plugging in an external hard drive and gives you extra storage.  What is not clear to me is how to use it within the toolkit.  Looks like you can create new volumes and create a snapshot, but I am uncertain as to how to add anything to the volumes.  Perhaps I am missing the purpose of EBS?Any help is appreciated.<blockquote>	</blockquote>"

The thing is though, there isn't really a load balancer... load balancing within clusters is abstracted within the software that maintains the clusters that are dynamically created within the EC2 infrastructure. I hope I didn't just confuse you more than you were...I will be continuing to write articles on this architecture, so keep an eye out because in each one I try my best to explain this somewhat different architectural paradigm differently than the last time. It isn't easy to pick up right off the bat, but the more you work with it, the more it starts to make sense. As far as session data goes - in general, sessions do not hold session data across a cluster of servers in most cases regardless. As users hit the URI, EC2 distributes them in a ""round-robin"" fashion. I'm a bit hesitant to say this because I need to confirm it, but as far as I know, the architecture is such that a single user would never be using resources from more than 1 instance at a time... I don't believe it is that kind of distributed system (""DAC"" systems are rare for several reasons, but that is beside the point). With that said, the cluster would never have a need to share session data. However, I will double-check on this to make sure because you bring up an interesting point.-Dan"
Sample Code & Libraries Articles & Tutorials and Amazon Machine Images	"Re: Clarification on the architecture of the cluster
Apparently I hit submit too soon...The sentence: ""As far as session data goes - in general, sessions do not hold sessiondata across a cluster of servers in most cases regardless."" should read: As far as session data, sessions are usually not shared amongst servers within a cluster.Sorry if this caused any confusion.As a sidenote, there are exceptions; such as the Adobe EDGE platform for CDN networks... I believe that runs this sort of distributed architecture in order to pump as many data packets as possible from an array of redundant servers for high-bandwidth video streaming, for example. Like I said though, as far as I know this is not the type of architecture of EC2, but I will double check with the development team to make sure."

Forloop, thank you for the compliment. I am happy to hear you were able to get running with no problems. It took a lot of trial and error before I was able to get that far so I could right this article, so I'm glad it saved you some time. I will answer your questions to the best of my ability...1.  Can I deploy to an AMI other than the default Tomcat Cluster?  An AMI that has both Tomcat and mysql for example?A. This requires a bit more of a global understanding of AWS to understand. The SimpleDB service is intended to provide the data storage solution. The idea here is separation of tiers in the infrastructure, which has its advantages. Let's use a simple example: A Linux/Apache/PHP AMI could be deployed to a cluster of EC2 instances, which simulates the ""application tier"" in an enterprise network infrastructure where the business logic is separated from the data layer. Then, you would create a sort of ""adapter"" type of class, which would negotiate a peristent data connection with SimpleDB while the user is running the code on the EC2 instance they are connected to. 2. Can I use the toolkit to take an existing instance, add additionalapplications (such as kettle or a vpn utility for example) to it, bundle it and deploy it to s3?A. This kind of extensibility has not yet been implemented as far as I know, although I imagine that as AWS continues to grow at such a rapid rate, such things will be possible sooner than later.3. You don't elaborate much on EBS view, and there is not much in the helpdocs.  The best description of EBS is that it is like plugging in anexternal hard drive and gives you extra storage.  What is not clear tome is how to use it within the toolkit.  Looks like you can create newvolumes and create a snapshot, but I am uncertain as to how to addanything to the volumes.  Perhaps I am missing the purpose of EBS?A. You caught me red-handed on this one. You are correct that I seemingly skipped over the EBS view. You are also correct in your assumptions about its purpose, although I had not spent much time trying to make it work. It was my understanding at the time of the writing that the integration of the Elastic Block Storage into the toolkit was undergoing some maintenance and code review to get it fully functional, so I believe it is still safe to say that there is nothing that you are missing....yet. I have a feeling that this will be completed soon and this will be evident most likely by documentation updates that include plenty of information on how to use it, along with some tutorials as well I'm sure."
Sample Code & Libraries Articles & Tutorials and Amazon Machine Images	"Re: Elegant - but what's happening behind the scenes?
Nice toolkit and article.

I am having some questions about the contents of the tomcat server AMI 
and the way the eclipse plugin is communicating with the server and configuring it.

As far as I know, the tomcat is deployed on port 8080.
This is a problem as proxies not always allow outbound traffic on that port.
So I decided to change it to port 80.
Changing the Server properties of the EC2 Tomcat Server 
does not help: I changed <eclipse_server>/server.xml to
<Connector connectionTimeout=""20000"" port=""80"" protocol=""HTTP/1.1"" redirectPort=""8443"" />
without results.

So it seems the deployment of applications to the Tomcat server need some other ports...

When cloning the instance to a new AMI (bundle) I discovered that the tomcat service is not running at all at the server!? Even JAVA_HOME is not configured. 

Anyone more information on these points?

thanks,
Adel"

Adelg, I take that back, I do have an answer for you. Install the Firefox ""ElasticFox"" plug-in, select ""Security Groups"", right click on the default group under ""Your Groups"", select ""Grant New Permission"", and add TCP/IP port 80 for HTTP access. VOILA!"
Sample Code & Libraries Articles & Tutorials and Amazon Machine Images	"Re: Elegant - but what's happening behind the scenes?
Correction on the last statement, you do not need ElasticFox to open port 80. Simply navigate to ""Security Groups"" in the EC2 management console, select the respective group and use the bottom panel to open port 80 for http access. ElasticFox is definitely a handy tool though."

I'm installing my own license for SQL Server 2008 on the Basic Microsoft Windows Server 2003 (AMI Id: ami-de4daab7).

When I initially install everything is fine. I install everything on the C drive. I use the local Administrator account and created my own account.

I then bundle this into a new bundle and register it as one of my own. 

I then terminate the original instance. 

When I launch a new instance with my new bundled AMI I am not able to connect to the SQL Server Database Engine. 

I am able to connect to the Analysis Services without an issue.

I believe the issue with with the hostname / computer name. After I bundle and relaunch the hostname changes. I believe this is causing a problem when SQL Server is looking for windows authentication. 

Has anyone else run into this or a similar problem? Suggestions on how to fix it?

This article has been a great help in setting up an amazon instance to replicate a mysql database on a production server.  I am looking at this backup script as a potential way to do snapshots.  Thanks for this great resource.

I have one big question.  

I have some reservations about installing the authentication credentials on every instance or ebs that I want to do snapshots of, but it looks like there is no way around it other than some kind of remote 2-call mechanism which would increase the amount of time the database was frozen.  Is this just a fact of life?   Do I just resign myself to installing api-tools and credentials on all instances or ebs's that need snapshots?

It seems that what is needed is a facility to delegate to an instance the ability to create snapshots of itself into s3 without authenticating.   

Does anyone have any other ideas about the best way to do this?

One question: the fstab approach doesn't appear to work if i want to save the MySQL-EBS configuration as an AMI, and I'm wondering if there's any reason why I wouldn't just use my.cnf to point the datadir, conf.d directory and log file dirs to the XFS volume?"

Sample Code & Libraries Articles & Tutorials and Amazon Machine Images	"Re: Use of XFS for EBS volumes as recomended by article
Eric - thanks for your reply.  Doesn't work, meaning I probably shot myself in the foot somehow .  After saving an AMI with the fstab changes you recommended, I created a new instance using the new AMI, detached the volume from the original source instance, and attached it to the new instance to test things out.  Two things I've noticed so far:1) In the new AMI, the /etc/mysql, /var/lib/mysql and /var/log/mysql directories are no longer there, but they do exist in /vol.  This disallowed mysql startup.  Not sure how I managed that - I'm still scratching my head.  During the AMI bundling process, I do admit to learning that you can't bundle to an XFS volume :-|, and so during that bumpy learning process things may have gotten fu-bard.2) In the new instance, fstab still has entries for the mysql mappings, plus the /dev/sdh /vol xfs noatime 0 0 entry.  But I still have to mount /vol (I assume because I attach the vol to the new instance post-boot), and the mysql mounts don't work of course, because they don't exist on the instance.   For new instances using just my.cnf to redirect the datadir (etc) I'll still need to mount /vol but I'm hoping to avoid any filesystem weirdness. I'm on your Debian AMI, so not using AppArmor. Feedback appreciated."
Sample Code & Libraries Articles & Tutorials and Amazon Machine Images	"Re: Use of XFS for EBS volumes as recomended by article
jpmalek: If you excluded the directories in the AMI, then you will need to make them again on the new instance.  A simple ""mkdir"" should work.  Then you can mount the directories from /vol over top of them as described in the tutorial.I'm not sure what you have in your setup, but you might be able to get away with:  sudo mkdir -p /etc/mysql /var/lib/mysql /var/log/mysql  sudo mount -a"
Sample Code & Libraries Articles & Tutorials and Amazon Machine Images	"Re: Use of XFS for EBS volumes as recomended by article
Eric - ah, makes sense.  I didn't do any explicit exclusion of the fstab dirs during the bundling process, but it makes sense that bundle-vol might exclude them (?).  Didn't think of that.  You're right about the mkdir and mount commands - that fixed things.  Now that I think about it more, it makes sense to not have those directories in place when instantiating a new instance, so that there's an explicit mount process to go through before mysql will function properly, mysql can't inadvertently use ephemeral storage, and the EBS volume has to get used for datastore.  Nice."
Sample Code & Libraries Articles & Tutorials and Amazon Machine Images	"Re: Use of XFS for EBS volumes as recomended by article
Eric,I just came across your tutorial, and I had the same problem as jpmalek.  The bundling process excludes the /etc/mysql, var/lib/mysql and /var/log/mysql directories.  From a little reading I saw that these directories may need to be added to fstab in order to not be excluded?  Is that the case?  If not, how do you you include these directories in the bundling process so that mysql will start when the bundled instance starts?"
Sample Code & Libraries Articles & Tutorials and Amazon Machine Images	"Re: Use of XFS for EBS volumes as recomended by article
swilcher25:The tutorial does not have a bundling process.  I describe (and recommend) starting a new instance using the base public AMI and installing MySQL from scratch before mounting the EBS volume with the database snapshot.if you are rebundling the instance and running that as a new AMI then:1. You don't want the database directories to be in the bundled image.  That's what the EBS volume is for (persistence).2. You don't want MySQL to run when the instance starts because the database is on an EBS volume which is not yet attached or mounted.  On startup of a rebundled image you would need to take steps like:a. Create the empty mysql directories to be mount pointsb. Attach and mount the EBS volumec. Mount the volume's mysql directories in the right placesd.

Hi vivakibt,You might want to make sure that your mysql process is not bound to your local interface (127.0.0.1:3306), but rather is available to the public (0.0.0.0:3306).  You can find this configuration in your my.cnf file, probably in /etc/mysql.You may also want to check for local firewall rules on your instance.Regards,-Jason"

There's definitely some confusion in this listing. The title states it's for 32-bit images but some of the listed AMIa are 64-bit.

The reboot or stop/start issue on micro images is to do with the ephemeral0 store not being supported on micro.You have to edit the /etc/fstab and remove the /dev/sdb mount.

Is there interest in streaming / chunked data handling for large files? I have files that are several GiB and the current approach of reading the entire thing into memory is less than ideal ( Response:__init__: self.body = http_response.read() ). I was going to hack it up with a callback, something like:

data = []
While True:
    chunk = http_response.read(CHUNKSIZE)
    if not chunk:
        break
    if callback:
        callback(chunk)
    data.append(chunk)
self.body = data.join

That way the interface can remain pretty much intact; you'd just pass the callback function into get.

It'd be even nicer if a generator was used to get the body, something like:

While True:
    chunk = http_response.read(CHUNKSIZE)
    if not chunk:
        break
