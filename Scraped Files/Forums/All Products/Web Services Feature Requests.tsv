Web Services Feature Requests	"Power Search doesnt work with or
You're searching for a publisher named ""Time Warner or Little Brown.""   Try changing Power to something like ""(publisher:Time+warner)+or+(publisher:Little+Brown)"".
Also, please use a valid AWSAccessKeyId in example queries.  It's really annoying to try to help someone only to discover they've made it harder than it should be.

Hi,lots of thanks this works perfectly.
I'm sorry if you got confused because of the missing AWSAccesKeyID. Next time I will state more clear that I took it out of test requests.<FONT face=""Times New Roman"" size=""2"">
But I have followed the guideline from Amazon Documents:Note: Please take care not to post Your Access Key ID Here to the Discussion Board.Lots of thanks
Tobias</FONT>"
Web Services Feature Requests	"Power Search doesnt work with or
Please include your AWS Access key in example queries.  It's not secret (look at the URLs returned by AWS) and leaving it out just makes it harder for others to help you.
I don't recall anyone from Amazon suggesting that you shouldn't use your key in this forum.  In fact, representatives from Amazon have used their own keys in posts.
There may be some confusion because AWS recently introduced a ""secret key"" that you really should keep secret since it gives you access to paid services.  But the secret key never appears in URLs.

Web Services Feature Requests	"Power Search doesnt work with or
The question of whether it is secure or not aside... the question of whether to post it or not was specifically asked in one of the chats because of the constant back-and-forth and it was the recommendation of the Web Services people that one ""not"" post their subscription id.   I agree it is easier to help people when they do but that is not Amazon's recommendation.Jim"
Web Services Feature Requests	"Missing Merchant Name for OffersFull
Hi,
I'm using ECS's OffersFull response group.
I've noticed that for some merchants, their Name do not appear in the XML markup. As a result, I'm unable to show my customers who they are buying from, which isn't good for trust.
For example, try this Asin: B000CFK07Q
please assist.

Web Services Feature Requests	"TimeoutError
I've been getting the exact same error.  I noticed it yesterday occurring about 2/3 of the time.  Today it seems to be happening about 1/3 of the time.  The message says ""Timeout waiting for data"", but it happens instantaneously, so I'm not sure why they call it a timeout.  I hope they get this fixed.  Here it is in its entirety: <UrlInfoResponse>- <OperationRequest><RequestId>&ltAccess Key Removed></RequestId></OperationRequest>- <UrlInfoResult>- <Request><IsValid>True</IsValid></Request>- <Errors>- <Error><Code>AWS.AlexaWebInfoService.TimeoutError</Code><Message>Timeout waiting for data.</Message></Error></Errors></UrlInfoResult></UrlInfoResponse>"

I can confirm that I've been getting the AWS.AlexaWebInfoService.TimeoutError in the last 2-3 days. It appears to be a global issue, and I hope the group moderators will post a comment soon.

Web Services Feature Requests	"TimeoutError
Hi,
I've been getting the same error. I just noticed it happening last night.
In my reports, it looks like I've been getting charged for this as well.
In the downloadable reports, it still shows my normal UsageValue's over each hour throughout the past couple of days, but i'm not getting any results.
It's pretty hard to write applications that depend on this information if it's not reliable!
Is there anything we can do to fix it?

Can you try removing:

As I said, the problem isn't really with the min/1 max/1, it's with the min/1 max/3 scenario. Anyway, I removed the min/max and here are the results:1 selected: math works fine2 or 3 selected: math always goes to zero."

hi Matt, actually, this is my 2nd month on AWS so I have yet to hit the 10k mark. i notice from my own counter that it differs from Alexa's when this problem arises... i'm now down to about 1 in 8 searches conducted via my site are being 'clocked-up' on Alexa. I'm assuming that this would mean requests resulting in the timeout error do not seem to be picked-up by their system. Hope this helps.
From my side, this bug is quite inconvenient... i went to press this week and my site is getting good interest.

Web Services Feature Requests	"Confused about nuance of 'keyword' srch
I'm baffled. When I go to the Amazon Power Search and search for     keywords:""ACT Exam"" I get about 120 matches. When I do the same thing in a programmatic query, however, I get two.

<FONT color=""blue"">(yes, I've pulled out my access key for privacy. :-)</FONT> 
Please don't do that.  You're asking for help, but making harder for us to help you.  There's no reason to remove your Access Key ID from examples you post here.
When I do a power search at Amazon.com using keywords:""ACT Exam"", I get the same two responses you're getting from ECS.

I'm still a bit baffled. I go to the Amazon Power Search page athttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/subst/search/books-power.html/103-3889308-9903034and enter   keywords:""ACT exam""and get:   All 178 results for keywords:""ACT+exam""Not two, 178.   ???"

Very Strange .....
I was using the power search form at:
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/stores/static/-/books/search/102-3388150-4393764
This one returns the same two items as your query.  I found it by clicking on ""Books"" then ""Books Search"" at Amazon.com.

Then perhaps I can ask you a different question?  How would you do an API search for all books about the SAT test, or the ACT test?  Thanks!DT"
Web Services Feature Requests	"Confused about nuance of 'keyword' srch
Try power searches for 
keywords:""American College Tests""
keywords:""Scholastic Assessment Test""
I found these keywords by looking at the product page for Amazon.com for a book on the subject.  Near the bottom of the page you'll see the book's keywords under ""Look for Similar Items by Subject.""

Another way is to list the products in the following browse nodes:

Hi, I've noticed that the Listname node of the ListmaniaList response group contains a typo error.
for example, the phrase ""My Friend's Gifts"" is spelt ""My Friend""s gifts"".

Web Services Feature Requests	"Either Actor or Director, but never both
Hi,
I've got possibly a bug to report. Lately I find that Amazon ECS is returning either Actors or Directors for DVD entries. Please take a look at the following search request on Amazon U.S., with response group set to large, only Director: Ron Howard is returned for keyword ""Cinderella Man"".
http://webservices.amazon.com/onca/xml?Service=AWSECommerceService&Version=2005-03-23&Operation=ItemSearch&SubscriptionId=&ltAccess Key Removed>&AssociateTag=mediaman-20&SearchIndex=DVD&Keywords=Cinderella%20Man&ResponseGroup=Large
However, the following same search query on Amazon U.K., returned Actor Russell Crowe and Renee Zellweger, but no Directors:
http://webservices.amazon.co.uk/onca/xml?Service=AWSECommerceService&Version=2005-03-23&Operation=ItemSearch&SubscriptionId=&ltAccess Key Removed>&AssociateTag=mediaman-20&SearchIndex=DVD&Keywords=Cinderella%20Man&ResponseGroup=Large
Now I'm sure that for these new entries in the catalog, both of the fields should already be in the ECS system. But why didn't ECS return these fields?
I think the bug appeared recently because several months ago, I'm sure I can get both fields.
Any suggestions?"
Web Services Feature Requests	"Either Actor or Director, but never both

Hi,I've been reading Google's webmaster guidelines and it mentions the support of the If-Modified-Since http header.  Upon learning of its benefits (reduced bandwidth and overhead), I feel that Amazon ECS could stand to benefit from its use as well.Take, for instance, browsing for product by browsenode.  This is something that nearly every Amazon associate site employs. It may be possible for developers to pass the If-Modified-Since http header to ECS.  ECS would cache all calls it receives.  For each call, ECS would check to see if any of the data has been changed based on the value of the header.  If no change, ECS could simply return the appropriate status code and the site making the call could use its cached version of the data.  If there is a change, the new data is retrieved from ECS and it can be cached on the associate sites and on Amazon's servers.I don't have all of the details of how all this could work, but I believe that we all stand to benefit from it if it is employed.Thanks for considering."

Hello to all. I am working on a proof of concept for a program that will consist mainly of a website, where some users will receive a number of points, which could be redeemed to purchase through Amazon.

But at this point, each purchase is made against each user's account.My question is: do you know of any existing applications or web services that would allow the purchase to be made by all users against a single account?At this point I'm thinking it would probably be a good idea to keep all the purchases on my DB, pending approval, then create a batch and commit all the (approved) purchases of the last XX days against a single account.Thanks in advance for any replies/comments/suggestions,

Web Services Feature Requests	"Sort Blended Search Results by Relevance
I would like to see the blended search results sorted based on the <RelevanceRank> returned in the XML (more like the results returned at the Amazon.com ""All Products"" search).  I know I could sort them myself on the client-side, but it seems to make more sence that they would be pre-sorted based on the RelevanceRank since that information is already calculated in the response.
EXAMPLE:
Doing a blended ItemSearch for the keywords ""Miracle at Midway"" returns results from 5 <SearchIndex>'s and returns 12 specific <Item>'s.
The first <Item> is an HP iPAQ which is from the Electronics <SearchIndex> which has a <RelevanceRank> of 2.
The Books <SearchIndex> which has a <RelevanceRank> of 1, includes a book which exactly matches the search keywords, but it is listed 6th in the <Item>'s list.  IMHO, it should be listed first - just like it is when you do an ""All Products"" search for the same keywords on the Amazon web site.
Interestingly, even if I do an Electronics search on the web site for these keywords, *NO* electronics results are returned, and I still get the book listed first.  In fact, no other stores (i.e., SearchIndexes) are returned on the web site regardless of how I search.  Why does the blended search return such unusual results?
In my opinion, the blended search is basically just a generic search of Amazon's products.  Even though it is ""blended"" I see no reason to return 5 SearchIndexes if there is only 1 obvious and appropriate result."

There is no specific mode or search index for a given node since a browse node may contain products indexed by zero, one, or several modes/indexes.  But you can find a good mode/search index for a given node at http://www.browsenodes.com/ or by using the web services offered at BrowseNodes.com.

<FONT color=""blue"">How can I do it? Is it implemented somewhere so that I can take a look?</FONT>
I do that at BrowseNodes.com (http://www.browsenodes.com/).  The site's PHP code reads the information from a database and does something like the following to build the path:
$text = """";$Parent = $Node;while ($Parent != 0 && $Parent != -1000)  {    $node = $Parent;    // Get $Title and $Parent for $node from database    $text = "" / <a href=\""node-$node.html\"">$Title</a>"" . $text;     } $text = substr($text, 2); // Path is now in $text
You can do something similar with the information returned from the BrowseNodes.com web services.  As an example, for the node <U><FONT color=""#996633"">1086598</FONT></U>:
http://www.browsenodes.com/xml.php?action=BrowseNodeInfo&node=1086598
The web service results include the ""Path"" and ""PathList"" to the node:
 <Path>Office Products &gt; Brands &gt; Avery</Path> <PathList>1064954/1086182/1086598</PathList> 
The Path is textural and the PathList is numeric.  The trick is to combine the two using something like the following (in PHP):
// First parse results into $Path and $PathList$titles = explode(' &gt; ', $Path);$IDs = explode('/', $PathList);
// Build the string$text = '';$i = 0;while ($i < count($titles)) {  $Title = $titles[$i];  $node = $IDs[$i];  $text = "" / <a href=\""node-$node.html\"">$Title</a>"" . $text;   } $text = substr($text, 2); // Path is now in $text
The above examples are in PHP (and untested), but should be adaptable to other languages.  I assume you could do something similar in XSLT, but I'm not very familar with XSLT so I can't give an example.

Given a specified Browse Node ID, the ECS BrowseNodeLookup operation will return the children of the specified node.  It currently doesn't return the parent node.  You can find the parent by looking in the BrowseNodes response group returned for a product within the node but that's not very practical in most cases.
Browsenodes.com (http://www.browsenodes.com) offers a web service which returns both the parent and child nodes for a specified browse node.  It also returns other information such as a good SearchIndex or mode to use for the node and a flag telling you whether the node is appropriate for use in a store.

So I will be getting partial assistance from Geobytes (www.geobytes.com) which is capable of finding where the visitor is from and where a particular site is hosted....It is capable to go down to the level of cities and NOT just at country level...(Tokyo, London, Brisbane etc)...But what happens if a businessman from London hosts his site with a NewYork based hosting service provider...The result collapses...

When doing an item search, it always appears to do a 'fuzzy' search, where items that are deemed 'close' to the search request are returned.  It would be nice if this was optional, so that I could turn it off for searches.  Something on the order of +, - logic like most sites use would be nice.
For example +camera -digital:
Would search for all cameras, that are not digital.  This would be an extremely nice addition to the search.  Right now, the searches are so broad as to be often unusable."
Web Services Feature Requests	"Add CD catalog number to the API
With many CD's existing with identical titles, especially within classical music, the catalog number is one of the only pieces of information on a CD that can ensure it is identical to one listed on the Amazon site.  It also makes hunting down a listing much easier.  The amazon web site allows searching classical music by catalog number, but this isn't carried over to the webservices API.
It would be very helpful to be able to search CD's (both classical and popular music) based on record label and catalog number programatically.  This also implies that the catalog number would need to be added to the results displayed in an ItemLookup.  With the data existing in the amazon database, it's a shame it's not available.
Thanks,
Jonathan"
Web Services Feature Requests	"Add a WishListName property to wishlists
Customers are allowed to give Wishlists user-friendly names, but this information is not returned when looking up a wishlist, only the ListId is given.  This means that only a generic ""[CustomerName]'s Wish List"" name can be displayed to the customer, or worse, a name containing the ListId.If the customer has multiple wishlists, the only distinguishing characteristics available to display are the TotalItems and the CreatedDate, which is still rather cryptic.It would be far nicer to be able to show, for example, ""Books"", ""Music"", etc."
Web Services Feature Requests	"Add a LastUpdateTime property
I would like to see a ""LastUpdateTime"" property added to the response (and request) data.  This would be especially useful for Wishlists.   It would allow for performance enhancements as data could be cached locally. A request for data could be made using the LastUpdateTime.  If no changes have occured, a response to that effect would be returned by Amazon services.This is equivalent to a 301 Not Changed response in HTTP.  The Last Update Time is equivalent to an HTTP E-Tag."

Web Services Feature Requests	"Include Customer Image in SmallImage Tag
I notice that products having only a ""customer image"" don't get any of the SmallImage/LargeImage XML tags in AWS.  Why not?  Detail pages on the production site display them by default, so I'd say AWS should refer to them too.  While we're at it, how about including customer images in search result pages on the production site too?  Example...Detail page at Amazon, shows customer image:http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/8845225712/AWS ItemLookup for same item, no ref to images:http://webservices.amazon.com/onca/xml?Service=AWSECommerceService&SubscriptionId=[yourID]&Operation=ItemLookup&ItemId=8845225712&ResponseGroup=Medium,VariationSummary&Condition=All&MerchantId=AllSearch result page at Amazon including this item (5th one down), no picture:http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/ref=dp_srsubj_entry/?%5Fencoding=UTF8&index=books&field-keywords=Longhi%2C%20Pietro"
Web Services Feature Requests	"Remote cart
I have a number of UK Amazon sites using the remote shopping cart functionality. However, my conversion rate is average due to the fact that once visitors check out, they are then directed to the Amazon shopping basket (MergeCart=TRUE for UK shops). This can't help their perception as they have checked out of my shopping cart only to then be directed to the Amazon one.
When will UK associates be given the same service as the US where MergeCart=FALSE allowing visitors to check out of the affiliate site and go straight to Amaon's register or log in pages hence avoiding the Amazon shopping cart?

Is there a way to ping multiple nodes and take their invenotry listings through XML, and have this entire process automated.

Web Services Feature Requests	"Multiple SearchIndex for ItemLookup
It'd be great if you could incorporate the use of multiple SearchIndexes when using a BrowseNode in ItemLookup and merge the results. This would help give complete item results for some areas.Example:ASIN B0007U9E14 (Pampers Cruisers Size 4 Economy Pack) is the #1 item in SearchIndex=HealthPersonalCare associated with BrowseNode=13106231. An ItemLookup with this BrowseNode and SearchIndex combo results in hundreds of ASINs. If I use the same BrowseNode with SearchIndex=Baby I don't get the ASIN listed above and only one ASIN is returned (B000669FDQ) instead of hundreds.Thanks,John"

You can use batch request:
http://webservices.amazon.com/onca/xml?Service=AWSECommerceService&Version=2005-03-23&Operation=ItemSearch&SubscriptionId=&ltAccess Key Removed>&AssociateTag=webservices-20&ItemSearch.1.SearchIndex=HealthPersonalCare&BrowseNode=13106231&ItemSearch.2.SearchIndex=Baby&MerchantId=All
Above call will return results from two search indexes - <FONT color=""black"">HealthPersonalCare and Baby. Note, results will appear under two separate ""Items"" nodes. </FONT>

Web Services Feature Requests	"Multiple SearchIndex for ItemLookup
Hi Elena,Thanks for the quick response.This works, but gives me 2 different <Items> nodes to deal with. My initial reaction is this could result in some major overhaul work, and we'd have to show up to 20 items on a page instead of just 10; otherwise, how do you handle going to page 2 for each search index individually? And it'll be confusing for the user as well, since there won't always be 10 results per page from each index. This is a can of worms.And if I sort on salesrank its sorted by each search so in the  case you gave, I'd have salesrank 1-10 from HealthPersonalCare coupled with salesrank 1634. Not a great solution from my perspective when you apply any of the sort algorithms. It really needs to be solved on the server side - merge the results and then sort, but I know its not that simple because you'll run into the same problem I outlined above without some additional engineering.Again, this gives us something to work with, but its not an optimal solution with many issues."

Web Services Feature Requests	"Website hosts
Before I go out and buy anything, I'd like to know that I have a good plan to set up an Amazon Associates website.
My PC is on Windows 2000.  I'm open to upgrading if needed.  I have a router.  The PC is a Dell Pentium 3, 1.1 GgH. 256K RAM.
I'm considering webhosting.com for the website host of 3 websites.  About a hundred a year.  They can work with XML & PERL.
I'll use FrontPage to build the pages.  (I'm very comfortable with this step, but do warn me if there's something I need to be aware of.)
I'll need Associate Engine to ""connect"" w/Amazon.com and show my referrals.  This appears to be easy to follow.
Is there something I'm not thinking of?  Can I reasonably pull this off without having to pay someone to help?"
