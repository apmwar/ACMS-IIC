AWS Training & Certification	"crowd-semantic-segmentation customoization
Hi, 
This is my first time testing the semantic segmentation hit and I would like to know if there is any way to customize the colors of the labels in the hit. I'm making this question because let's say I have an object that is predominantly purple. I would like the color of the label to be of the same tone so to be more intuitive for the turkers to use it. 

I tried to modify the JSON for the label but it just gives me the following error, wich is frustrating:
We found some potential errors with your usage of Crowd HTML Elements.
 
(Element type CROWD-SEMANTIC-SEGMENTATION): Error reading attribute value:
[   ...
      ^

We're using the Amazon Mechanical Turk Command Line Tools v1.3.4 (not the newer AWS CLI).

AWS Training & Certification	"HIT status bug?
I am seeing a problem here with HIT status -- by the way, is there a better place to report possible bugs to the Mechanical Turk development team than this forum?Here is what I did. 1) I created a HIT using the CreateHIT API (from Perl using REST). The HIT ID number is  XYJ6TYY4PAYW3JYZSZQZ. I actually created a bunch of HITs at the same time.2) I waited a while, until all the other HITs in the group were showing ""Reviewable"" status (as a response to GetHIT). This one showed status ""Unassignable"", which seemed to indicate that someone had accepted the assignment, but it continued for a long time (much longer than the other HITs took to finish). The web Requester interface (requester.mturk.com) showed it as having no assignments, and the www.mturk.com home page did not show it as a HIT when I searched for it.3) Using the Requester web interface, I added a new assignment to the HIT. The status showed ""Assignable"" for a while. I searched for and then answered the questions from the mturk.com home page. The web interface showed there was one response pending review. But GetHIT status still showed ""Unassignable"".4) I expired the HIT from the web interface. The GetHIT status still shows ""Unassignable"" rather than ""Reviewable"".  The web interface shows there is one assigment pending review and that the HIT is expired.So... what can I do? GetReviewableHITs seems to have a bug (see previous post from late December), so I cannot find the complete list of reviewable HITs using that API. But it looks like there is a problem using GetHIT to find the HIT status too -- I need to wait for the status to go to ""Reviewable"", but it doesn't seem reliable. I need to have a reliable way to find out if a whole list of HITs have completed, so that I can read their answers and process the results. What API can I use, that will work? Thanks!"
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: HIT status bug?
Hi Steve,When a HIT is created you can set the amount of time that a worker has to complete it.  This time allotted is independent of the HIT expiration date.  For example, if I have a HIT that has an Expiration timeframe of one day and specify that a Worker can work on an assignment for 5 days, it is possible for that assignment to be accepted by the worker and essentially unavailable for the full 5 days.  If the Worker returns that Assignment before the 1 day HIT expiration is up, another worker can accept it.  During that time the HIT will be unavailable, since nobody can work on it.  If the HIT expires and then the assignment is returned, then the HIT should become reviewable.  The HIT won't become reviewable until all associated assignments are actually submitted.  A HIT will also become reviewable after it is expired and there are no assignments being worked on.In your case, it appears that a worker has accepted your assignment but not submitted it yet.Please let us know if this is still an issue for you.Thanks,- Isaac"

Just to point out - I have two accounts. I can't do this only in one of them, while in the second it is fine (the passwords are separated).
Maybe the reason is that one of the accounts is new and the other is old? If so, what can be done to separate the passwords in the old account?

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Separare AWS and requester accounts
Hello,

There are two sides of this coin - your root user access details, and IAM user access permissions. If you'd like to change your password or your access keys, you can find the information on how to do that at the link below. You can have an IAM user with a different access key than your root user password.

Resetting Your Passwords or Access Keys:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys_retrieve.html

Similarly, to allow other users to access the account, you will have to generate user credentials for those individuals. We've actually published a guide on how you can set this up so that multiple users can use the management console for your AWS account.

Hello John,

Thanks for asking this question. Looking over the crowd-radio-group button elements, I can see that the name is the same for each button. The normal expectation for radio buttons in a group is for them to share a name. However, with crowd radio group buttons, each name must be completely unique to differentiate them from each other.

This is mentioned in the documentation for the buttons themselves, but not the radio group documentation:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-ui-template-crowd-radio-button.html

AWS Training & Certification	"Changing Requester Display name doesn't work
I am about to publish my HIT for my research study, but have trouble changing the display name that shows up as the requester (testing in the sandbox using the API).

I was using my personal account, but changing the name on requester.mturk.com (which leads to Amazon.com) did not get reflected when I re-created the HIT. 

I then created a new account and when going into the requester page the first time, I was asked to fill out the contact information. For the ""Company Name"" it stated that this will be used as the requester name shown to workers. However, again my personal name shows up.
There is no place to change this company name anywhere.

I also tried changing the name in AWS, but it also didn't help.
How can I actually change the requester display name?"
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Changing Requester Display name doesn't work
Hello,

Thanks for asking this question - I'm sorry to hear you've been having some difficulty with getting your Requester account name changed. Generally speaking, after making a change to your display name, that change is going to require roughly 24 hours to propagate. You won't be able to see the name changed - at least, on the HITs you post, until approximately 24 hours have passed.

Also keep in mind that this is not retroactive, so you would need to create new HITs from new templates after this point for that name change to reflect correctly. Additionally, while you use the same credentials for your Sandbox account as your live Requester account, those accounts are actually considered separate. Making a change on your live Requester account won't reflect on the Sandbox account, and vice versa.

Even so, if you're still seeing that the name hasn't changed, we'd be more than happy to take a closer look at what's going on. In order to do so, we would need you to contact us at mturk-requester-support@amazon.com from the registered email on your main Requester account.

Hello AdamJ,

Thank you for your response.

So, in the sandbox at some point the name change got reflected. It seems that the actual ""Name"" under My Account > Personal Settings is used for that. Which by the way can only be changed in the production website, not the sandbox.

Now that everything works I want to create the HIT on the production system. However, I double-checked my qualification test and the personal name shows up again as author.

Is there a workaround to this? Is there any way to contact MTurk support to help without needing to reject everything?

Hello Daniel,

Thanks for bringing this up. You certainly don't need to reject everyone in order to contact support. We'd like to look into this further and see what might be going on, but to do that, we need to be able to look at your account and the HITs you've posted.

AWS Training & Certification	"Reviewable HIT; Missing Assignments
We have a system that uses the AWS API for interacting with mTurk.  In the last couple of months and specifically in the last week we have seen an increase in the number of HITs being marked as Reviewable and have no assignments completed and no pending assignments.  They are also not expired either.  When viewing the HIT JSON by the CLI, results appear similar to below for a HIT that is behaving strangely.  The converted epoch dates below are: creation time (GMT), Wednesday, January 30, 2019 3:26:12 PM; expiration (GMT), Wednesday, February 6, 2019 3:26:12 PM.  Why would a HIT be marked as Reviewable, not expired, and not have any completed assignments?

I managed to create a workaround for this. Selected a template, modify it as you please and copy the content to a local file.

Hello,

Thanks for writing in to us about this. We generally recommend using the WebUI to manage your HITs if you created your HITs on the website, and managing your HITs via the API if made using the API. You will find some inconsistencies between the two methods as they don't follow the same methodology and functionality as each other. One point being, the API will provide answer data, but the website UI results file will provide you with a detailed list of every input with the answer data as an individual column within the file.

The image will appear scrunched because the instructions are open during the HIT preview. However, the image resizes automatically within the iframe. Inside the iframe, collapsing the instructions provides more room for the image. But in the Requester website, the iframe itself is smaller (e.g., see hhttps://requester.mturk.com/create/projects/new ) than it is on the worker site. Workers will see an experience with the image sized appropriately for the larger window.

Definitely possible.  My HITs have workers record a video of their computer screen and upload it to my server.  Using MTurk's ""ExternalQuestion"" you can have your HIT's user interface hosted on your own server.

is it within the term of use of MTurk if the HIT has a description of the task together with a link to an android/ios phone app that the worker would use to 


download the app from the store
type their worker ID into it
take a picture of the requested item
upload the image (behind the scenes to a s3 bucket)
write the response code from the mobile app into their HIT page on their desktop


are these within guidelines of the ToS? Also, what would be a fair price for such a HIT?

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: upload image from phone
I think workers would be more likely to want to do your HIT if they did NOT have to download an app to do it.  I don't understand why you are adding that step.

As for pricing, I'd suggest you time how long it takes for you to complete the entire task.   How many could you complete in an hour?  Then calculate your pay based on what you want workers to be able to make doing your HITs.   If you want fast turnaround on your HITs getting completed, you'll need to pay more than if you are okay with workers only doing your HITs when there was nothing better for them to do.  Workers will also rate you as a requester on sites like turkerview.com.  If you pay a slave wage, workers will rate you poorly which will effect how many others will want to complete your HITs."

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: upload image from phone
I'm not that familiar with S3.  But you could have a web server that allows someone to upload a file and then have the webserver send the file to S3.  So users could take the picture with their camera app and then switch to your HIT's web page to upload the file."

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: How do I make sure workers do not complete my HITs in less than 30 seconds
Hello Gok,

Thanks for asking this question. Workers are able to preview your HIT unless you customize your HIT to prevent that from occurring. This adds another variable to consider, as Workers may actually view your video before accepting the HIT so that they can complete it quicker upon accepting. 

There really isn't a mechanism to force Workers to watch an embedded video in a HIT template. However, we might be able to approach this a different way, which is how to validate that a Worker watched the full video. For instance, if we consider how a survey is formatted, a Worker would proceed through questions, completing them before moving on to the next page. In the same sense, you could make the video a required element, where it needs to finish before a Worker could proceed to the final page where their completion code would be. While my knowledge of third-party survey sites' features is limited, this may be possible through a website like Qualtrics.

That completion code, or a method of validating that the Worker reached the end of the video, may be a more reliable method for ensuring they're watching the entire video as you require.

Hello,Do you know how can I create a HIT that given an image, the worker clicks on the image, and I get the coordinates of where he has clicked?Thanks"
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Tracking an image
You have at least a couple of choices:1. create a flash or java application that presents the image and detects mouseclicks.2.  Use an external question, and serve a client image map or server image map that sends the values back to your server.  3.  Use javascript to store the coordinates of an onmousedown event and post it back to turk as a form variable.In any case, there isn't a simple way using the standard QuestionForm document to do this.  You are probably going to need to use the ExternalQuestion document and host an application.   Option #3 allows Turk to save the data as part of the completed assignment, but you need an external host to do it.  Hope that helps,James"

Hi James,Thanks for your answer.  That's what I was thinking.  All the solutions might be developed as an external question right? Because I tried to add some Javascript code in the web interface templates and it did not work."
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Tracking an image
There are two different UI designers for HITs.1. ""Create HITs Individually"" - this creates a QuestionForm-based HIT, and javascript is not possible2. ""Design HIT templates"" - this creates an ExternalQuestion-based HIT, and javascript is possible.You can also create HITs using the API, at which point you have flexibility to do either type, but each type has the capabilities and limitations described in the documentation."

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Image feature identification?
Hi Joshua,

Yes it is possible with some code writing, as you can create customized Javascript/HTML HITs and implement something like this. You could do one of the following:

1. If you are comfortable with using our Requester API , you could host a web page on your server with your code (using the  ExternalQuestion HIT structure). 

2. A variation on the above is to create the HTML content for your HIT and submit it directly to MTurk via the API and let us render the page (using the HTMLQuestion HIT structure).

3. You could also use our  Requester website and create a HIT using our HIT editor,  as described here. The HIT editor also lets you write custom HTML and add Javascript so you could implement a solution to detect where the Worker clicked on an image and submit that as part of the results.

There are other Requesters who have implemented ideas like this previously and you may also want to see what others have done before. Check out some examples  here ,  here and  here.

AWS Training & Certification	"Best way to deal with workers bullying me into paying
Hi all, I'm new to MTurk. I'm wondering what is the best way to react to a flood of angry email from the ~17% of workers who did a lousy job and got a reject. They keep on emailing, accusing and threatening. Should I ignore them? Should I try to engage them? I tried to talk to some, but the moment I show them the evidence of lousy job, they switch to the ""you're a bad person not worth my time"" argument. I'm puzzled and distressed."
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Best way to deal with workers bullying me into paying
First thing I would do is abort the HIT to minimize this problem.

Then, I'd find some way that the worker could redo the work for me and then reverse the rejection.  If you plan to be using mturk for any length of time, you need to protect your reputation.  Workers use sites like https://turkerview.com/ to share their experience about different requesters.  Once you get some bad reviews, you will find it more difficult to attract workers to do your HITs.

Next, I'd try to find out why 17% of people are unable to complete the HIT satisfactorily.  If you don't qualify your HIT to only accept workers with a 99% approval rating I'd add that; you don't want to deal with workers that are getting rejects frequently from other requesters.  Check your HIT's instructions.  How could you make it clearer what your expectations are?  Are you paying enough for your HIT?  If people can't make more than minimum wage doing your HITs, workers aren't going to be motivated to do a good job.  Is there any way that you can detect unsatisfactory work before users submit the HIT?   In my HIT, users are creating and uploading a video.  One of the most common problems I saw was users having their mic muted.  Now I have code that detects this situation and warns the worker if this is an issue with their video.

If you want more advice, please give more details about your HIT.

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Best way to deal with workers bullying me into paying
Hello AlessioAj,

Thanks for asking this question. I'm sorry to hear you're getting a lot of negative interaction from Workers on the marketplace. Ultimately it is at your discretion whether or not you engage those Workers. Userbob provides a lot of great advice for moving forward from here.

However, you do have the option of blocking Workers from the Manage Workers page (https://requester.mturk.com/workers) which prevents them from doing any further work for you in the future. Even though messages can be initiated through the website, you receive those messages through your email provider. To block a Worker from messaging you, you would just need to block them through your email provider.

We would be happy to look into the HITs you've published to see if there was an issue leading to this response from Workers. In order to do that, we would need you to contact us from the registered email on your Requester account. If you'd like us to investigate further, please contact us at mturk-requester-support@amazon.com.

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Best way to deal with workers bullying me into paying
My task includes rating several items on several dimensions. One item is rated twice, and I look at the consistency of scoring - if the 1st time the item was rated 1, 7, 5 and second time 6, 1, and 2 (I use more sophisticated statistical methods than visual inspection, and most Workers pass this test easily), I presume that Worker either didn't pay attention or didn't care, because it's highly unlikely that the same person rated the same item on the same dimensions so differently while being honest. Some of the workers care so little that they rate an item with the same rating on all dimension (e.g., all ""1"" or ""4"") - this is highly unlikely to be honest, but apparently speeds up clicking.

I could probably detect poor work during the task, but what could I do after that? I might ask a worker to redo the task, but I wonder if I want such a worker to do the task at all. Would telling/showing them why exactly their work was rejected help them agree with a reject? 

What is a way to allow workers redo a task? If I create a list of workers (I think it's called ""assigning a qualification"" on MTurk) and create a new task for them, many of them may not notice that I've done that. If I reply to every angry email with a new-task invite, I'll spend way too much time and my emotional energy being polite to people who threaten to me that ""nobody will work for you but those new to MTurk"" - I guess I've already been rated even though I've only hired 100 people.

Thank you for your help - I appreciate it."

@AdamJ-AWS, is there any way MTurk could mediate the dispute between me and workers?"
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Best way to deal with workers bullying me into paying
Hello,

Amazon Mechanical Turk is unable to mediate disputes between Requesters and Workers. Our Participation Agreement is clear in your ability as a Requester to reject assignments, however. A good cause for rejecting an assignment is that the Worker doesn't follow your instructions (as long as the instructions are clear and concise), or that the Worker doesn't put forth an honest effort to complete the assignment. A good example is someone going through and checking the first option on every survey question to get through it as quickly as possible.

Ultimately, as long as you have good reason to reject an assignment, it is at your discretion to do so. 

Aside from creating a Custom Qualification, granting it to that subset of Workers who you want to retry, publishing a HIT with that Custom Qualification as a requirement for a second try, and then replying to those Workers to let them know the HIT exists, there is no way to let them perform a re-do on a task you've rejected an assignment for.

We sincerely appreciate your patience, nonetheless. However, if you have any other questions or concerns we might be able to help with, please let us know by contacting us at mturk-requester-support@amazon.com.

-Adam J"
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Best way to deal with workers bullying me into paying
Best advice I have would be to make sure your HIT has qualifications specified to only allow workers who have completed at least 500 HITs with a 99% approval rating. Then, only reject work that you are positive are from someone who wasn't trying to give honest feedback.  Also pay well enough so that if you do get some negative worker feedback ratings you will also have some positive ratings so that workers will still do your HITs.

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Best way to deal with workers bullying me into paying
Blocking workers through the requester interface is a short term solution and will negatively impact your requester account.

What Adam AWS did not mention is when you block a worker using the requester interface, this will cause Amazon to sometimes send a threatening email to the worker telling them their work is not up to par and their worker account could be banned from future work. While you are helping Amazon police their platform, your requester account reputation is getting demolished on requester review sites and forums further leading to the unwanted emails and bullying. 

I agree with the second part, send them to spam in your email. PLEASE keep in mind these are a minority of workers. It also sounds like you were using ambiguous checks to define bad data although it does sound like you got some bad workers. 83% did do quality work!

We can beat this dead horse one more time I guess.

There is NO reason for Amazon to tell workers a requester banned/blocked them since whenever the worker inquires about it, Amazon gives them a form letter saying they cannot disclose the reason but are more than willing to send a threatening email with your requester name attached."
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Best way to deal with workers bullying me into paying
Hello,

We propose you utilize our Custom Qualifications feature to create a Qualification that will act like a filter, and make it a requirement on your HITs that Workers “have not been granted” that Custom Qualification in order to participate. This accomplishes a similar end goal, without the potential message regarding disciplinary action from the block function. The only caveat being that you must continually apply this filter to your HITs and any Workers you want to block in order prevent those with the Custom Qualification from accessing any subsequent HITs you publish.

However, I think it’s important that Requesters make use of the block feature in situations where it’s appropriate to do so. It’s meant to be used in those situations where allowing a Worker to continue would be not just unhelpful but detrimental to your process or your data.

I'm wondering whether we can use API to create a HIT that is ""hidden"", i.e. only workers who meet the qualification can see and preview this HIT?

I noticed that this can be done through the requester interface by picking the ""hidden"" option in the ""HIT visibility"" section. However, I haven't found an equivalent way to do so through the API yet. I understand that we can set a ""private"" value to be true for a qualification in the API, but I feel this action is equivalent to pick the ""private"" option in the ""HIT visibility"" section on the requester interface, which means that all workers can see the HIT, but only qualified workers can preview and take the HIT. 

Your kind help is really appreciated! Thanks in advance!"
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Is there a way to create a ""hidden"" HIT through API?
You can create HITs through the API that use the Hidden HIT Visibility setting by getting the HITType ID out of the project API information popup and then calling CreateHIT with it.

After creating a project with the settings you want, click on the project name at https://requester.mturk.com/create/projects.

In the popup, you'll see the HITType ID.

You can then call CreateHIT and pass that ID into the HITTypeId parameter. These HITs will have the same HIT Visibility settings as your project (in addition to the other HITType settings such as title, description auto-approval delay, etc).

The popup also contains the Layout ID and Layout Parameters (if any). You can use these to create HITs through the API that use the same layout and input parameters as your project. For more information about HITLayouts, please refer to the  HITLayout documentation .

I attached screenshots showing where to click on the project name and what you'll see in the popup.

Thank you,
Sam

Thank you Sam!

Just one more question --- I'm using Java API and hosting the HIT through external website, so I create new HITs through the ""createHITs"" call with externalQuestion set up in the .question file, while the input parameters and the HIT properties are prepared in the .input file and the .properties file, respectively. Is there a way to set HITTypeId through createHITs call (at the moment, I only find createHIT call contains the ""HITTypeId"" parameter)?

Thanks a lot for your help!"
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Is there a way to create a ""hidden"" HIT through API?
There isn't a version of the createHITs method that takes in a HITTypeId, but you could refer to the code inside the below version of createHITs in RequesterService to see how it calls createHITAsync with the hitTypeForBatch variable it gets after calling registerHITType. It uses the .properties, .input, .question, and .success files. You could write similar code to do this with the HITTypeId you get from the Requester website instead of populating most of the HITProperties via the properties file. You would still need to pass in the MaxAssignments and LifetimeInSeconds values (assignments and hitlifetime values from the .properties file) to your createHITAsync call. 

public HIT[] createHITs(HITDataInput input, HITProperties props, HITQuestion question, int numHITToLoad, HITDataOutput success, HITDataOutput failure)

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Need help creating my first HIT
Hello Dave,

Thanks for your interest in Amazon Mechanical Turk! We have many templates on our website to help new Requesters get started on their projects. For yours, I would recommend the ""Collect Data"" template, which you can access by going to the ""Create"" page. If you haven't made any HITs yet, the New Project template list should be the first thing you see.

It's important to note that, though we provide a pre-fabricated task for this type of project, you will need to customize the template to match your specific needs. This will require editing the HTML source code of the HIT in order for it to function as intended. While it is a third-party website and isn't affiliated with Amazon, I personally use https://www.w3schools.com/ as a reference for certain actions that I need to perform using HTML and CSS. There are often references for JavaScript included in their tutorials for more advanced features.

Essentially, you would be creating a list of website names in a CSV file under a single header. That header would correspond to a piece of code in your HIT called a variable. The system is going to look at your CSV file filled with the names of those companies, and for every row, it's going to create a HIT by replacing the variable in the template you edited. If you have 100 companies, the system is going to do that 100 times until you have 100 individual tasks for Workers to complete.

Note that HITs and assignments are different - a HIT is one instance of the task you're creating, whereas the assignment is a single Worker completing that HIT. If you want redundancy in the information you're getting, you could (for instance) say you want three Workers to do each one of your tasks. This means you would set your assignment count to three. Using the same example as above, when the system makes those 100 HITs, it's going to make three assignments available for each one of those, for a total of 300 assignments. 

I'm including some information to help you get started. I understand it's a lot of information to absorb all at once, but it's definitely important to take your time and review it to get the best understanding of the task at hand.

AWS Training & Certification	"Question submitting website data request
Hi everyone, 

I'm new to mechanical turk and am having trouble with my first request. 

I have a website with 31 companies listed on it (https://nrfbigshow.nrf.com/startup-zone). Each company has it's logo on the site, which is hyperlinked to the company's website. I would like to have the Company Name, URL, a brief description and headquarters location listed for each. 

I'm having trouble figuring out how to list the 31 companies under one HIT. Do I need to list 31 different form fields for each element I'm requesting? How do I pay for this? I was thinking of offering about $10 for the request (should take less than an hour). Should I post list $0.33 each, or $10 for one HIT? 

Any help would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks, 

Chris"
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Question submitting website data request
From another requester's point of view, if this is something that you yourself could complete in an hour, I'd suggest you just look them up yourself.  If on the other hand, there were hundreds of companies you needed to look up and it was going to take you several days to do yourself, then maybe you would use mturk to do it.

But to more directly answer your question, I would think that you would want to have 31 different HITs.  Keep the basic properties of the HIT the same, and put the company names in the details.  In that way the HITs will get presented as a ""batch"".   Post just one HIT at first and see if you get the results you like.  If you aren't happy with the results, try adjusting the instructions.  You could set up a ""negative qualification"" that you grant to workers that you don't want to do your HITs again.  Once you find a worker that is producing the results you like, you might assign all the remaining ones to that specific worker.

As far as pay goes, you'll get what you pay for.  If you want your descriptions to sound like something that a user rushed to get done in two to three minutes, paying $0.31 would be about right.

To make HITs show up as a batch, the properties listed below should be the same:

Title
Description
Keywords
Reward
AssignmentDurationInSeconds
AutoApprovalDelayInSeconds
Qualifications"
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Question submitting website data request
Thanks for the reply, userbob!

Normally I would do this myself, but there are other pages I want to do the same thing for in the hundreds, which would take several hours. And there are a bunch of them, so if I can get this right I easily have days worth of work on my hands. This request is really just a test. 

I thought of putting the company name in the request, but if I take the time to go through the entire list and type out the company name, I may as well just do the rest of it. Again, not a big deal for this request, but when I get to larger pages, it's a significant amount of work. The other way I was thinking about doing this was having one HIT with 31 form field entries, but that won't scale well at all. 

For the pay, the description should just be cut and paste from the website. I have done this myself many times and it takes about 30 seconds per company once your'e in the groove. So for someone good at this, it could take as little as 20 minutes. I tripled the time to try to make it fair (and worth someone's while). Again, when I get into the larger pages and several hours time, I think the numbers will make more sense. Does that sound right? 

Thank you for the help!

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Question submitting website data request
That sounds good.  You'll definitely need to find out how to start a batch of HITs.   Because it sounds like it would take longer to create a single HIT than it would to do one.   I'm not familiar with using the mturk web site for creating HITs.  I create mine programmatically using java and the mturk API."
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Question submitting website data request
Hello vfChris,

Thanks for asking about this! Userbob certainly has some good suggestions, one I want to call attention to is breaking your data up into individual pieces. As you're using the website and looking over our available templates for data collection, you may notice that each of those is purpose-built to provide information for one instance of the task you're designing.

You can customize these templates to include as many websites as you would like to per individual task, but keep in mind, the simple and most straight-forward tasks often come away with the best results. Should you choose to move forward with that design, you would need to include a unique variable for each individual piece of information that you're trying to provide in the HIT. For whatever data you need back from the Worker, you would then include a unique input field for that purpose.

There are two blog posts we've published that you may find helpful as you're designing this task. The first is a tutorial on how to go about gathering data on Mechanical Turk, and the second is an explanation of how variables function in your HIT with CSV files.

I got an answer from Arrin at Amazon MTurk team as follows:

 
When Workers aren't able to see your HIT, it's generally because one of the reasons below:


Worker doesn't hold the Qualifications necessary to see the HIT
All available assignments have already been accepted by other Workers
You have your reward set to $0, and the search function is set to find HITs that offer at least $0.01 as a reward.


Since your HITs all of a $0 reward, this is most likely the reason for why the Workers don't see the HITs when searching. They will need to change their search filters to find your HITs."

AWS Training & Certification	"javascript in non-external HIT
Hi,

I need to post some HITs that use javascript.  I can't host them locally, so if I understand correctly, the external HIT type is not suitable for my needs.  

Right now I'm using the Web Interface to set up my HITs and I've successfully included small amounts of javascript to validate inputs before allowing submission, and to expand and contract the instructions (copied from one of the templates).  

I now want to post a HIT that involves swiping text to fill templates, and we have written the javascript to do this, but I'm not sure how to incorporate it into my HIT since it is a more substantial amount of code, including a modified version of the jquery UI library.

Any update on this?"
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: javascript in non-external HIT
Have you tried to use the API in any programming language you like?
For example, I use the boto library in Python to create my HIT and I was able to create a complete html page with some javascript and jquery. The only drawback is that you won't see it in the UI but you can access it as a worker on the sandbox to ensure that everything works fine."
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: javascript in non-external HIT
No, I haven't tried the API yet, partly because there appears to be no way of setting up a batch of hits like you can via the web UI.

Can someone point me to clear document on how to create HIT groups or something equivalent via the API?  Thanks!"
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: javascript in non-external HIT
I think you are correct that HITs are displayed as a batch if they have identical properties.  Here's an old page that discusses this a bit.

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: javascript in non-external HIT
Hello,

To provide a quick comment on batched HITs - that's correct. HITs that share the same properties will be batched together when you publish them. However, you can differentiate each set of HITs by using unique tags on those HITs. As long as there is one differential among your HITs, they will be batched separately.

I hope that helps. I apologize for the delay, but we are still working on your original request.

AWS Training & Certification	"Can subjects download a survey form and then upload the completed form?
I am new to MTurk.  For our survey, we want participants to download a ""diary"" template, which they can print out hard copies of, and then carry a copy with them to fill out during the day, over a 7-day period.  (We will ask for no PII beyond the subject's MTurk ID.)  Afterwards, we'd like participants to scan their completed diaries and upload them so that we may access them.

Is it possible to enable the above downloading/uploading completely within Mechanical Turk?  Alternatively, can our HIT direct participants to a private Box folder hosted by our university?  Any tips you can give us will be appreciated!"
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Can subjects download a survey form and then upload the completed form?
Hello jezCID,

This is Adam from the Amazon Mechanical Turk support team. We've published a guide on our blog for enabling an upload option in your HITs, so that Workers can provide you with files directly.

This process uses S3 and Cognito to ensure that information is transmitted and stored securely.

Tutorial: How to create HITs that ask Workers to upload files using Amazon Cognito and Amazon S3:
https://blog.mturk.com/tutorial-how-to-create-hits-that-ask-workers-to-upload-files-using-amazon-cognito-and-amazon-s3-38acb1108633

Keep in mind that Worker participation is voluntary; there's no mechanism to ensure that a Worker will return after those 7 days with the information you're expecting. What you might consider as an alternative is to create a daily upload as opposed to a weekly one, so that you can provide incentive on a daily basis to keep up with the task requirements. 

You can use Custom Qualifications to gate participation, ensuring only the Workers who first participated in your task can continue on with it.

For more information on Custom Qualifications, you can check out or documentation listed below:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSMechTurk/latest/RequesterUI/CreatingaQualificationType.html

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Can subjects download a survey form and then upload the completed form?
Thanks for your prompt reply, Adam!  It is helpful, but only addresses one half of my question.  Is it also possible, using S3 and Cognito, to enable participants to download the survey template they will be printing out and then filling in on a hard copy?   (Even if so, though, it seems like it might be a lot simpler for us to host the template ourselves, and give participants a link to it.)  

Thanks again, and any further light you can shed on this would be great!"
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Can subjects download a survey form and then upload the completed form?
Hey again!

Apologies for not catching that. You hit the nail on the head there - you can host the diary template on an external site (something like a PDF file would work) and then provide a download link for it. That would most likely be the easiest and most straight-forward solution.

If there's anything else we can assist with, please don't hesitate to let us know."
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Can subjects download a survey form and then upload the completed form?
Awesome!  Thanks once again.

If I could trouble you with a follow-up question, we're still unsure about how we can get participants to accept or sign a Consent to Participate form before taking the survey.  (Our university IRB requires this.)  I understand this can be done in Qualtrics and other survey hosting sites, but we're not planning on using any of those.  Any suggestions?"
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Can subjects download a survey form and then upload the completed form?
Ultimately how you present your consent form, or the contents of your consent form, are dependent on your organization and their requirements. Additionally, our Policies prohibit any collection of Personally Identifiable information. If your consent form requires written acknowledgment via a signature or disclosure of an individual's name for instance, it would breach those policies.

However, you have a couple different options for how you can proceed. One thing you could consider doing is setting up a Qualification Test which would include your consent form, and by completing that Qualification Test, the worker signifies their consent to participation. From there you would grant a Custom Qualification representing that consent to the Worker, and you could make that Custom Qualification a requirement on your HITs. 

Utilizing Qualification Tests will require using the API tools to fabricate, however, and the API is currently the only way to approve Qualification requests.

If your requirements are not so stringent, I have also seen Requesters provide the consent form just as a declaration in the task itself, so that by participating, a Worker is agreeing to the consent form.

Hello,

Thanks for your patience while we worked on this. There are two ways to do this, if we are correct in understanding that you want Workers to update a live document (or a document that will perform a live update while Workers complete aspects of it).

The first way is to link to a public Google spreadsheet. In this approach, you're allowing any Worker to modify any part of the spreadsheet. The caveat here is that there is no restriction on how Workers interact with that spreadsheet, so you'll be taking a chance that they complete it successfully and accurately.

The second option is to set up an external question. You will need to set up your own database  for this, and server, and record each Workers' answer into your database as Workers complete your HIT.

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Need to implement a 10x10 grid to ensure no two answers are the same
Hello,

A HIT is a single instance of your overall project type, with an assignment being a single unique Worker completing that task. You can certainly design your project to have multiple different HITs, or you can have a single HIT that you request multiple assignments for. It depends on how you would personally like to structure that design.

Our fees are based on the reward amount you offer for the completion of your HIT, and the number of assignments included in any HIT that you publish. Additional fees will apply if you use Premium Qualifications on your HIT.

AWS Training & Certification	"No batches to review in Sandbox
I'm developing an mturk task with Python. I test my task and mark HIT as done in workersandbox. I look in requestersandbox results and I find nothing.

Did I not mark something right with Python or what could perhaps be a reason why I find nothing in the Results menu in the requestersandbox?"

AWS Training & Certification	"Request this Qualification broken?
I am running a complicated HIT that has some workers running into errors.  I'd like to still be able to pay them through Mturk, so I decided the best way would be to create a simple 1 item hit with a ""back pay"" qualification that I would give them.  

They would request the ""back pay"" qualification if they ran into an error, and I would approve it so that they could take the easy hit to get paid.  When I try testing it though, searching for the""back pay"" qualification on the site and requesting it as a worker, I get ""This qualification does not require you to complete a test. You may request this qualification by clicking on the continue button below. ""  After clicking ok I get the message ""Your request for the Qualification ""Back Pay"" has been submitted to Requester Project Implicit.""  

The only problem is that my requester account does not get any kind of message that I can find.  Nor does my worker account even remember that I've already requested the ""back pay"" qualification- I can request it multiple times.

These users have not completed a HIT with us before, so there is no way to assign then a qualification from the web interface.  I know that the command line tools can assign a qualification to any worker, but I am looking for a solution that non technical colleagues can use to pay workers who ran into trouble with a HIT."
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Request this Qualification broken?
I'm having this same issue, is there anyone who can answer this question?"
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Request this Qualification broken?
This feature is unfortunately not available in the UI. In order to grant Workers the qualification requested, you need to gather which Workers requested the qualification either though the CLT commands or the APIs.  You would need to use the GetQualificatonRequest operation.  This operation will give you all the Workers that requested your qualification type.   

If you are using the UI and not comfortable with writing code, the CLT tools are pretty to download and run from a command prompt.  

I'm not sure if you want to unreject assignments that have already been rejected.  You can do this by contacting customer support (https://requester.mturk.com/contactus) with the assignment IDs you would like to unreject.  Make sure you have enough funds in your account to pay for the assignments."
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Request this Qualification broken?
Seven years later, unfortunately, but there is a solution for this!  And it does NOT involve using the API!  Short answer (if you know how to do a couple things already):
1. Create a custom qualification
2. Create a new project with just a text field or question where they agree that they are, in fact, the workerID that has been approved for the make-up HIT (you can put in instructions that all other workerIDs will be rejected).  Put in custom qualification as necessary qualification.
3. To get to a worker's web page that has never submitted for you before, go to:
https://requester.mturk.com/workers/{enter workerID here}
You will be able to assign your custom qualification to them!
NOTE (If workerID has submitted for you before, you can assign the qualification by going to Manage>workers and then finding their workerID and assigning the qualification.

AWS Training & Certification	"Accurate Work Time estimates?
Is there any way of getting an accurate work time estimate?  The WorkTimeInSeconds I believe includes time that is not spent on task when workers are permitted to accept multiple HITs and queue them.  I just want to make sure that we're paying a fair rate.  We have piloted the tasks in-house but that's not always an accurate yardstick of how long it will take a worker to complete a task."
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Accurate Work Time estimates?
Hello again Claude!

There isn't currently a metric recorded for active time spent on a task. WorkTimeInSeconds is how long a Worker has spent with the HIT, from the time they accept the HIT to the time they finish working on that HIT. 

Depending on the type of task you're using, there may be other tools you can use to find this information. Many Requesters who utilize external surveys on the website like to use Qualtrics, who provide a timer (or a feature to include one) for the amount of time it takes a Worker to complete the survey from the moment they access it. At least for surveys, this may be more in line with what you're looking for. 

You could also ask Workers to time themselves as part of your instructions, though this may not prove as accurate as the other options. 

I hope that answers your question! If you have any other questions or concerns please don't hesitate to contact us.

Two days ago I posted a HIT and it worked fine.  This morning I made a copy of the HIT, added some additional qualifications, edited some of the instruction text and posted another batch using the same input file and started getting replies very quickly, with no Answers.  I cancelled the batch immediately, but due to people being able to queue up HITs, I am getting (and paying for) hundreds of useless results.  

When I look at the Assignment IDs in the web interface, the HIT looks correct with all the correct questions.  I copied the HIT HTML to the Sandbox and it works perfectly there.  Any idea what could be going on?

AWS Training & Certification	"Prevent workers to complete more then one of my hits
Hello, 
I am uploading several different HITs. I want each of them to answered by only one worker, and I found easy to that using max assignments.
I want also to prevent any worker to complete more than one of my HITs. How can I do that?"
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Prevent workers to complete more then one of my hits
Hello,

Thanks for this question! By design, the system allows a Worker to accept one assignment from any HIT that you publish. So theoretically, if you publish ten HITs at one assignment per HIT, a single Worker could accept all ten of those assignments from each different HIT.

The best way to prevent that from happening is to create and then grant a Custom Qualification to any Workers who have participated in your HITs. Then, on any subsequent HITs you publish, make it a requirement that your Custom Qualification ""has not been granted.""

This will ensure that anyone with your Custom Qualification will be automatically disqualified from accepting more HITs.

The problem here, as you may have already identified, is this only really works when you're not publishing HITs simultaneously. You would need to publish one HIT at a time, grant the Custom Qualification to the Worker who completed that HIT, and then publish the next HIT with that Qualification restriction.

Here’s a guide we’ve published on creating Qualifications:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSMechTurk/latest/RequesterUI/CreatingaQualificationType.html

As well as a guide on how to assign those Qualifications to Workers:
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSMechTurk/latest/RequesterUI/AssigningaQualificationTypetoaWorker.html

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Create Project for External Survey
Hello abriels,

Thanks for asking this question! We have a pre-made task template referred to as the ""Survey-link"" template, which allows you to link Workers on Mechanical Turk to a survey that you've created on an external site. We also have a tutorial for using Google Forms with this template that we published on our blog.

https://blog.mturk.com/tutorial-getting-great-survey-results-from-mturk-and-google-forms-da4993d878df

The Survey-Link template is customizable, though getting the introduction you want in just the manner you want it will require some HTML knowledge to properly format.

The more difficult aspect of this will be targeting individuals within the specific criteria that you need. We don't currently have any Premium Qualifications (which are essentially our demographic filters) that will allow you to narrow your eligible participants to those who like to shop fashionably. 

You have two options for how to proceed here - you can create a demographic survey prior to publishing your main survey, so that you can find those eligible participants. Then you can create and grant them a Custom Qualification of your own design, setting that Custom Qualification as a requirement (has been granted) on your main survey. This way, only individuals who have that Custom Qualification will be able to participate.

The second option would be to include a brief screening questionnaire in your survey to gather that information.

There's quite a lot that we can discuss surrounding this topic, and we'd love to learn more about your project to continue assisting you. If possible, please contact us at mturk-requester-support@amazon.com.

Thanks Adam J. for answer as I had a very similar question.
In addition to directing Turks to an external survey site such as SurveyMonkey and having them take a qualifying test, is there any payment required for turks who are rejected? I would also like to avoid any negative feedback for Turks who take a very brief qualifying survey and are rejected. Specifically, I will need a certain number of turks in each of several age groups (which do not correspond to the Turks age groups) as well as turks who hold at least a moderately strong opinion on a political issues (their is no point in them continuing if they do not currently hold an opinion). Suppose I have secured enough Turks who are age 28 or below and would like to reject the next Turk who is age 28 or below? Or need to reject a Turk who holds no or a neutral opinion on the political issue I am studying? 
Any help here is much appreciated.
Paul"
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Create Project for External Survey
@UnivSDPaul, I would price your HIT based on an amount you are willing to pay people to answer your screener questions.  For example $0.01.   If a worker does not match your current needs after answering your screener questions, you just pay them the $0.01.   If they do match what you are looking for, you can tell them how long you expect it for them to complete the rest of your survey and how much you will pay them.  Any one that does complete your full survey, you'd pay using a bonus.   Alternatively, you could use two HITs.  The first one is just the qualifier questions.  The second is the complete survey.   You would qualify the users who completed your screener questions in the first HIT to your liking to do the second HIT.

In this way, you don't reject any one.  Users don't like rejections because it limits what other HITs they are allowed to do because the best HITs only allow users with a 99% approval rating to work on them. If you were to reject users as you suggested, users will rate you poorly on turkopticon.ucsd.edu and then you'll have a harder time getting users to accept your HITs in the future."

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Mturk Account Suspended - LONG Time HIT poster
We appreciate the response, but still looking for resolution. The knee jerk response keeps being ""...our security policies..."". No one has actually said how our HITs violated the Amazon Security policies, they do not. Some disgruntled workers complained I guess and someone took their say so. But also if we really dig into even someone accidentally disclosing personal info, which is what a response said to us yesterday and isn't what the TOS says since that happens every day all over the place including:

1. Amazon's own messaging service violates their TOS. Though it is ""anonymous"" only when it's first sent by Worker. Then it comes as an email to us which completely discloses a Workers info. Unlike Craigslist which keeps all communications with a unique email address Mturk does not. And if we respond, now they have ours. Over the years we've received phone calls at our office and I regularly get emails with my first name from Turkers all because they initially used the link to contact a Requester.

2. Do we realize that all those HITs that require visits to a website COULD be semi traced back to someone via their IP address, cookies, etc? That's why the TOS says ""Workers cannot be REQUIRED to disclose info"" because the writers understand that accidental disclosure is inevitable.

Guys, a large reason for the spirit of the non-disclosure of the personal info is so Requesters dont try to hire Workers directly. After 5 years and over 1,100 workers through the API, we aren't doing that at all. Cannot believe we are not also looking at that.

BTW do you know how many Workers send us a message encouraging us to do that to save fees? And we have no recourse other than to block them (well, only if they have actually done one of our HITs in the 1st place since we incredibly cannot block beforehand. So Requesters cannot warn other Requesters not to use Worker X)

Very frustrating since we use this every day and are at a stupid standstill over...not sure what. It seems the flagging of some Workers that were probably blocked for submitting ""unseen evidence exists spatial flags careful"". The type of gibberish response we get DAILY and sift through and deal with. Now that same Workers has evidently helped lead to our service being suspended???"

I would like to extend the deadline on my project ""Congressmen Background Collection"", which has 21,980 HITs. It says I don't have sufficient funds, but I don't think I should need to pay extra to extend the deadline, and I have already paid for this batch. I don't need to complete additional HITs after this batch, so I don't want to pre-pay per the solution I found here (this would also cost >$2000): https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=90655

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Can't Extend Batch
Hello,

Thanks for writing in to us about this. I completely understand that you'd prefer not to add funds to the account in order to extend the HIT. Unfortunately, it's not possible to extend a HIT without doing so. The system sees extending the HIT as publishing the HIT again, and as such, you would need to add funds equivalent to the original cost of the HIT to extend it.

It's important to note, however, that these funds aren't actually used when you extend the HIT. As soon as the operation to extend has been completed and that transaction has been fully processed, we can issue a refund of the extra balance you provided to extend that HIT. 

I apologize for any inconvenience, though I'm more than happy to provide your feedback to our Business team.

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Can't create HIT with Layout parameters and Type (MTurk AWS SDK)
Hello,

Thanks for your patience while we reviewed your use-case to see what's going on here. After investigating, we narrowed the issue down to an erroneous space at the end of your ""HITLayoutId"" parameter.

Instead of being ""HITLayoutId"" in your code, it's ""HITLayoutId "" - as far as the API is concerned, this is treated effectively as if there is no HITLayoutId. If you remove that erroneous space, you should be able to call CreateHITWithHITType successfully. 

Following the circumstances and steps above we were able to recreate the issue you experienced, and then resolve it successfully.

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Adding custom variables to the response sheet
Hello,

Thanks for your patience awhile we looked into this. 

1) Can I add <input> tags with my desired value, and do I need to embed them in a <form> tag (is there an existing <form> tag already surrounding the section)?

• If you're using the MTurk Requester website, then any HTML content in your template will automatically be surrounded by a <form> tag on save. 

Depending on your use case, you can surround the form inputs with your own <form> tag, which we'll detect and not inject an additional <form> tag.

If you want to render an input tag with a default value to show to your Worker, you can have an input element with the value attribute.

If you want a default value, but don't want to display anything to the Worker, you can use an input element with type ""hidden"".

For more info, please refer to external documentation for the input tag, for instance: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input

2) How do I get the value of the <input> tags to be outputted in the csv? Is this already defined in JQuery? 

• Mechanical Turk does not do anything special with the form data. You can use any native HTML form elements for your form data. See our documentation on HTMLQuestion for detail: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSMechTurk/latest/AWSMturkAPI/ApiReference_HTMLQuestionArticle.html

If you want the additional values for in the result CSV, but don't want to display it, you can use a hidden input.

3) Same as 2) for placeholders

• If you want to use the placeholder attribute for the input tag, you can. If you want to submit the placeholder text as a result, you'll need a hidden input. Again, this will work in exactly the same way as HTML forms work.

4) Will these inputs add up to the existing ones (worder ID ect.)?

•Yes.

I have several questions and/or feature requests regarding qualifications used with the API.

1. Why is it possible to disable notifications to workers while associating qualifications, but not while disassociating qualifications from them?

2. On HIT creation, all qualification requirements are combined with the AND operation. Is it possible to combine them with OR?
In my case, I try to allow workers to work on my HITs if they either do not own qualification A OR have a specific value on qualification A if it is present.
I do not want to require them to perform a qualification request for A even if it is auto-granted since that is an additional step and many workers also prefilter HITs for HITs they are allowed to work on without any required qualification requests.

Yes that's a valid solution, but it does not solve my use case presented in the second question.

Hello Webis,

That's a great question, and I'm happy to forward your feedback to our internal teams. We're always working on improving the experience of using the marketplace, and thoughtful questions like yours are great to hear.

For your second question, this is a limitation of the system. A Qualification requirement is essentially a logic check to see if a Qualification exists, and if it exists at a predetermined value. It cannot simultaneously be required to not have the Qualification, or to have the Qualification. I'm sorry for any difficulty or inconvenience that causes with your HIT designs, as I understand you want to ultimately require fewer steps for Workers.

There are different comparators that can be used to restrict Workers based on whether or not they have the Qualification - we generally recommend using ""Has been granted"" if you want only individuals who have a specific Qualification to participate. The inverse of this is using ""Has not been granted"", to ensure only individuals without the Qualification can participate. While this isn't a perfect answer to your second question, this can be an effective method of managing different groups of Workers as you've described.

Thanks for asking this question. The reward amount that you offer Workers is static - when you create a HIT, you set a certain amount for the reward, and that reward amount is paid to the Worker when you approve their assignment.

Creating multiple fields for a Worker to input multiple different survey codes would just require copying and pasting the HTML source code for one input field, and then editing the parameters to make each one unique. That last part is super important, though! You want to make sure each input field is unique, so you can validate each survey code.

Once you do, you can provide a cumulative bonus to the Worker equivalent to the value of completing those extra surveys (to whatever degree you feel is appropriate).

That's correct - as you would be receiving multiple survey codes as individual answers for your HIT, you would need to validate each one and then manually send a bonus equal to the value you determine that number of surveys to be worth.

The only way around the manual pay-out of issuing bonuses would be to write a custom API call of your own design. This would require an AWS account, some coding knowledge, and using the API tools to complete that operation.

AWS Training & Certification	"Help! Can Anyone Look Into My Suspended Account?
Hi! I am a graduate student at UChicago. I registered a Mturk account, janemturk@163.com, and provided my school address. However, I just received a message saying that Your account was closed for not providing true and accurate information about your location during the registration process.

It is true that I was outside the US when registering the account since I was on leave. But the location I provided is true and accurate. It is exactly where I spend most of my time studying and conducting research.

AWS Training & Certification	"So much wait to fund my requester account
Hi,
Yesterday (17h ago) I funded my requester account to be able to create HITs quickly but I am still waiting... How could this funding take so long?

AWS Training & Certification	"Deleting a hit programmatically still keeps status as ""Reviewable""
Documentation states:

Calling the DeleteHIT API operation sets the HIT state to Disposed. Deleted HITs can no longer be accessed from MTurk. Note that a HIT can only be deleted when it is in the Reviewable state and all its assignments have been approved or rejected.


Hit states are all Reviewable, meaning all workers have submitted answers for hit. So next question is have all assignments for the hits been approved?

 proxy.list_hits.hits.map(&:hit_status)
 =>  


I can get all assignments for each hit like this:

assignments_for_hits = proxy.list_hits.hits.collect { |hit| proxy.list_assignments_for_hit({hit_id: hit.hit_id}) }


For the ones that have assignments, they are all ""Approved"":


assignment_status = proxy.list_hits.hits.collect { |hit| proxy.list_assignments_for_hit({hit_id: hit.hit_id}).assignments }.flatten.map(&:assignment_status)
 =>  

So I should be able to set the hits to ""Disposed"" status:

 proxy.list_hits.hits.collect {|hit| proxy.delete_hit({ hit_id: hit.hit_id }) }
 =>  


But all still show ""Reviewable"" status:


  proxy.list_hits.hits.map(&:hit_status)

Why did they not change to status of ""Disposed""?"

I am wondering if it would be acceptable to create a HIT where workers upload scans of receipts (personal receipts they own), since receipts don't contain much personal information.

Edited by: SylvainG on Jun 30, 2018 7:17 PM"
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Can I collect sample phone calls ?
I have seen HITs where two workers have a chat conversation, so technically it is probably possible.  However, mturk policies restrict requesters from posting HITs that require workers to provide personally identifiable information.  So asking for a phone number will scare most workers off.  But you could mention that users need to use a ""burner phone number"" (such as burnerapp.com) to complete your HIT.  That way the phone number wouldn't be considered personally identifiable information.

If you were only using mturk for one of the phone call participants and you were providing the other, the HIT would be much easier.  (you could use userbob.com and not have to develop anything) But needing two workers at the same time means that one is going to need to wait for the second worker to also accept your HIT.   You'll probably need to pay workers at a good rate to attract enough people so that they are both doing the HIT at the same time.

As far as creating it on mturk, I would think you'd probably need to implement it as an ""external question"" which basically allows you to develop a web page on your own server and then your web page gets iframed by the mturk page.  So the details of recording a phone conversation and uploading an audio file are not really specific to mturk - you could get any web developer to create that type of system for you."

AWS Training & Certification	"Restricting workers by race to the HIT
As a requester how can I restrict turkers on the basis of race? I want only Black or White people to be able to participate in the study. Is there a way to restrict this in MTurk?"
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Restricting workers by race to the HIT
Hello,

Thanks for contacting Mechanical Turk! 

If you wish to restrict your HIT to certain race demographic, you can do so using our Custom Qualifications. Custom Qualifications allow you to restrict participation to your HIT based on the specific criteria in need. You would need to first find Workers that fit your criteria to grant the Qualification, which can be done in a few steps. The first step is to publish a demographic HIT first that all Workers are allowed to accept. Once you get submissions, you can review them to find Workers that fit your criteria to assign them the Custom Qualification. When you go to publish your actual task, you make it a requirement that Workers must have your Custom Qualification to accept.

You can find more information regarding our Qualifications here:
https://blog.mturk.com/tutorial-understanding-requirements-and-qualifications-99a26069fba2

Please note that asking Workers for basic demographic information is acceptable as long as your survey does not derive any personally identifiable information from Workers. For example, you may ask Workers for their occupation, relationship status, etc., but you may not ask Workers for personally identifiable information, such as their full name, email address, phone number, or equivalent in any HIT including survey HITs.

I am seeing a problem here with HIT status -- by the way, is there a better place to report possible bugs to the Mechanical Turk development team than this forum?Here is what I did. 1) I created a HIT using the CreateHIT API (from Perl using REST). The HIT ID number is  XYJ6TYY4PAYW3JYZSZQZ. I actually created a bunch of HITs at the same time.2) I waited a while, until all the other HITs in the group were showing ""Reviewable"" status (as a response to GetHIT). This one showed status ""Unassignable"", which seemed to indicate that someone had accepted the assignment, but it continued for a long time (much longer than the other HITs took to finish). The web Requester interface (requester.mturk.com) showed it as having no assignments, and the www.mturk.com home page did not show it as a HIT when I searched for it.3) Using the Requester web interface, I added a new assignment to the HIT. The status showed ""Assignable"" for a while. I searched for and then answered the questions from the mturk.com home page. The web interface showed there was one response pending review. But GetHIT status still showed ""Unassignable"".4) I expired the HIT from the web interface. The GetHIT status still shows ""Unassignable"" rather than ""Reviewable"".  The web interface shows there is one assigment pending review and that the HIT is expired.So... what can I do? GetReviewableHITs seems to have a bug (see previous post from late December), so I cannot find the complete list of reviewable HITs using that API. But it looks like there is a problem using GetHIT to find the HIT status too -- I need to wait for the status to go to ""Reviewable"", but it doesn't seem reliable. I need to have a reliable way to find out if a whole list of HITs have completed, so that I can read their answers and process the results. What API can I use, that will work? Thanks!"
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: HIT status bug?
Hi Steve,When a HIT is created you can set the amount of time that a worker has to complete it.  This time allotted is independent of the HIT expiration date.  For example, if I have a HIT that has an Expiration timeframe of one day and specify that a Worker can work on an assignment for 5 days, it is possible for that assignment to be accepted by the worker and essentially unavailable for the full 5 days.  If the Worker returns that Assignment before the 1 day HIT expiration is up, another worker can accept it.  During that time the HIT will be unavailable, since nobody can work on it.  If the HIT expires and then the assignment is returned, then the HIT should become reviewable.  The HIT won't become reviewable until all associated assignments are actually submitted.  A HIT will also become reviewable after it is expired and there are no assignments being worked on.In your case, it appears that a worker has accepted your assignment but not submitted it yet.Please let us know if this is still an issue for you.Thanks,- Isaac"

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: crowd-radio-group and crowd-radio-button do not limit one selection
Hello John,

Thanks for asking this question. Looking over the crowd-radio-group button elements, I can see that the name is the same for each button. The normal expectation for radio buttons in a group is for them to share a name. However, with crowd radio group buttons, each name must be completely unique to differentiate them from each other.

This is mentioned in the documentation for the buttons themselves, but not the radio group documentation:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-ui-template-crowd-radio-button.html

I'm letting our platform team know this is unclear, and sincerely appreciate you bringing this to our attention. I tested it myself with unique names for your buttons, and it worked like a charm.

Please let us know if there's anything else we might be able to help with.

AWS Training & Certification	"Changing Requester Display name doesn't work
I am about to publish my HIT for my research study, but have trouble changing the display name that shows up as the requester (testing in the sandbox using the API).

I was using my personal account, but changing the name on requester.mturk.com (which leads to Amazon.com) did not get reflected when I re-created the HIT. 

I then created a new account and when going into the requester page the first time, I was asked to fill out the contact information. For the ""Company Name"" it stated that this will be used as the requester name shown to workers. However, again my personal name shows up.
There is no place to change this company name anywhere.

I also tried changing the name in AWS, but it also didn't help.
How can I actually change the requester display name?"
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Changing Requester Display name doesn't work
Hello,

Thanks for asking this question - I'm sorry to hear you've been having some difficulty with getting your Requester account name changed. Generally speaking, after making a change to your display name, that change is going to require roughly 24 hours to propagate. You won't be able to see the name changed - at least, on the HITs you post, until approximately 24 hours have passed.

Also keep in mind that this is not retroactive, so you would need to create new HITs from new templates after this point for that name change to reflect correctly. Additionally, while you use the same credentials for your Sandbox account as your live Requester account, those accounts are actually considered separate. Making a change on your live Requester account won't reflect on the Sandbox account, and vice versa.

Even so, if you're still seeing that the name hasn't changed, we'd be more than happy to take a closer look at what's going on. In order to do so, we would need you to contact us at mturk-requester-support@amazon.com from the registered email on your main Requester account.

Thanks for your patience, and we hope to hear from you to assist further.

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Changing Requester Display name doesn't work
Hello AdamJ,

Thank you for your response.

So, in the sandbox at some point the name change got reflected. It seems that the actual ""Name"" under My Account > Personal Settings is used for that. Which by the way can only be changed in the production website, not the sandbox.

Now that everything works I want to create the HIT on the production system. However, I double-checked my qualification test and the personal name shows up again as author.

I sent an email to support since I also cannot create the HIT itself due to a HITLayout does not exist error (even though it does in production).

Hope to get this resolved soon.

AWS Training & Certification	"crowd-form answer-format
Hi,

The new crowd-form tag doesn't seem to have any documentation as to what the answer-format attribute means.  The Web UI sets that to ""flatten-objects"" by default, but that produces a different format than what used to be the default for radio buttons.  Previously if I had radio button set with name=""Foo"" and values of ""Yes"", ""No"" or ""Maybe"" I'd get an Answer.Foo column in my output with values of Yes, No, Maybe in each row.  Now I get 3 columns: Answer.Foo.Yes, Answer.Foo.No and Answer.Foo.Maybe each with a TRUE or FALSE value.

Hello,

Thanks for writing in to us about this. We generally recommend using the WebUI to manage your HITs if you created your HITs on the website, and managing your HITs via the API if made using the API. You will find some inconsistencies between the two methods as they don't follow the same methodology and functionality as each other.

Hello,

Thanks for your patience while we looked into this.

The image will appear scrunched because the instructions are open during the HIT preview. However, the image resizes automatically within the iframe. Inside the iframe, collapsing the instructions provides more room for the image. But in the Requester website, the iframe itself is smaller (e.g., see hhttps://requester.mturk.com/create/projects/new ) than it is on the worker site. Workers will see an experience with the image sized appropriately for the larger window.

Hi

I am new to AMT and was wondering if the platform supports a workflow where a worker take a photo of the some object in the physical world using their phone and uploads the image to a s3 bucket. Does anyone know if this is possible? If not, what would be the best approach to get as close to the above workflow as possible?

thank you in advance for your help"
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: upload image from phone
Definitely possible.  My HITs have workers record a video of their computer screen and upload it to my server.  Using MTurk's ""ExternalQuestion"" you can have your HIT's user interface hosted on your own server.  So if you can create a web site where the workers complete the task, you can definitely set that up.  You just need to make sure that your HIT doesn't violate any mturk policies."

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: upload image from phone
thank you userbob and SamH@AWS

is it within the term of use of MTurk if the HIT has a description of the task together with a link to an android/ios phone app that the worker would use to 


download the app from the store
type their worker ID into it
take a picture of the requested item
upload the image (behind the scenes to a s3 bucket)
write the response code from the mobile app into their HIT page on their desktop


are these within guidelines of the ToS? Also, what would be a fair price for such a HIT?

thank you in advance"
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: upload image from phone
I think workers would be more likely to want to do your HIT if they did NOT have to download an app to do it.  I don't understand why you are adding that step.

As for pricing, I'd suggest you time how long it takes for you to complete the entire task.   How many could you complete in an hour?  Then calculate your pay based on what you want workers to be able to make doing your HITs.   If you want fast turnaround on your HITs getting completed, you'll need to pay more than if you are okay with workers only doing your HITs when there was nothing better for them to do.  Workers will also rate you as a requester on sites like turkerview.com.  If you pay a slave wage, workers will rate you poorly which will effect how many others will want to complete your HITs."

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: upload image from phone
I'm not that familiar with S3.  But you could have a web server that allows someone to upload a file and then have the webserver send the file to S3.  So users could take the picture with their camera app and then switch to your HIT's web page to upload the file."

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: How do I make sure workers do not complete my HITs in less than 30 seconds
Hello Gok,

Thanks for asking this question. Workers are able to preview your HIT unless you customize your HIT to prevent that from occurring. This adds another variable to consider, as Workers may actually view your video before accepting the HIT so that they can complete it quicker upon accepting. 

There really isn't a mechanism to force Workers to watch an embedded video in a HIT template. However, we might be able to approach this a different way, which is how to validate that a Worker watched the full video. For instance, if we consider how a survey is formatted, a Worker would proceed through questions, completing them before moving on to the next page. In the same sense, you could make the video a required element, where it needs to finish before a Worker could proceed to the final page where their completion code would be. While my knowledge of third-party survey sites' features is limited, this may be possible through a website like Qualtrics.

That completion code, or a method of validating that the Worker reached the end of the video, may be a more reliable method for ensuring they're watching the entire video as you require.

Hi Joshua,

Yes it is possible with some code writing, as you can create customized Javascript/HTML HITs and implement something like this. You could do one of the following:

2. A variation on the above is to create the HTML content for your HIT and submit it directly to MTurk via the API and let us render the page (using the HTMLQuestion HIT structure).

3. You could also use our  Requester website and create a HIT using our HIT editor,  as described here. The HIT editor also lets you write custom HTML and add Javascript so you could implement a solution to detect where the Worker clicked on an image and submit that as part of the results.

Hi all, I'm new to MTurk. I'm wondering what is the best way to react to a flood of angry email from the ~17% of workers who did a lousy job and got a reject. They keep on emailing, accusing and threatening. Should I ignore them? Should I try to engage them? I tried to talk to some, but the moment I show them the evidence of lousy job, they switch to the ""you're a bad person not worth my time"" argument. I'm puzzled and distressed."
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Best way to deal with workers bullying me into paying
First thing I would do is abort the HIT to minimize this problem.

Then, I'd find some way that the worker could redo the work for me and then reverse the rejection.  If you plan to be using mturk for any length of time, you need to protect your reputation.  Workers use sites like https://turkerview.com/ to share their experience about different requesters.  Once you get some bad reviews, you will find it more difficult to attract workers to do your HITs.

Next, I'd try to find out why 17% of people are unable to complete the HIT satisfactorily.  If you don't qualify your HIT to only accept workers with a 99% approval rating I'd add that; you don't want to deal with workers that are getting rejects frequently from other requesters.  Check your HIT's instructions.  How could you make it clearer what your expectations are?  Are you paying enough for your HIT?  If people can't make more than minimum wage doing your HITs, workers aren't going to be motivated to do a good job.  Is there any way that you can detect unsatisfactory work before users submit the HIT?   In my HIT, users are creating and uploading a video.  One of the most common problems I saw was users having their mic muted.  Now I have code that detects this situation and warns the worker if this is an issue with their video.

Thanks for asking this question. I'm sorry to hear you're getting a lot of negative interaction from Workers on the marketplace. Ultimately it is at your discretion whether or not you engage those Workers. Userbob provides a lot of great advice for moving forward from here.

However, you do have the option of blocking Workers from the Manage Workers page (https://requester.mturk.com/workers) which prevents them from doing any further work for you in the future. Even though messages can be initiated through the website, you receive those messages through your email provider. To block a Worker from messaging you, you would just need to block them through your email provider.

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Best way to deal with workers bullying me into paying
My task includes rating several items on several dimensions. One item is rated twice, and I look at the consistency of scoring - if the 1st time the item was rated 1, 7, 5 and second time 6, 1, and 2 (I use more sophisticated statistical methods than visual inspection, and most Workers pass this test easily), I presume that Worker either didn't pay attention or didn't care, because it's highly unlikely that the same person rated the same item on the same dimensions so differently while being honest. Some of the workers care so little that they rate an item with the same rating on all dimension (e.g., all ""1"" or ""4"") - this is highly unlikely to be honest, but apparently speeds up clicking.

I could probably detect poor work during the task, but what could I do after that? I might ask a worker to redo the task, but I wonder if I want such a worker to do the task at all. Would telling/showing them why exactly their work was rejected help them agree with a reject? 

What is a way to allow workers redo a task? If I create a list of workers (I think it's called ""assigning a qualification"" on MTurk) and create a new task for them, many of them may not notice that I've done that. If I reply to every angry email with a new-task invite, I'll spend way too much time and my emotional energy being polite to people who threaten to me that ""nobody will work for you but those new to MTurk"" - I guess I've already been rated even though I've only hired 100 people.

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Best way to deal with workers bullying me into paying
Hello,

Amazon Mechanical Turk is unable to mediate disputes between Requesters and Workers. Our Participation Agreement is clear in your ability as a Requester to reject assignments, however. A good cause for rejecting an assignment is that the Worker doesn't follow your instructions (as long as the instructions are clear and concise), or that the Worker doesn't put forth an honest effort to complete the assignment. A good example is someone going through and checking the first option on every survey question to get through it as quickly as possible.

Ultimately, as long as you have good reason to reject an assignment, it is at your discretion to do so. 

Aside from creating a Custom Qualification, granting it to that subset of Workers who you want to retry, publishing a HIT with that Custom Qualification as a requirement for a second try, and then replying to those Workers to let them know the HIT exists, there is no way to let them perform a re-do on a task you've rejected an assignment for.

Best advice I have would be to make sure your HIT has qualifications specified to only allow workers who have completed at least 500 HITs with a 99% approval rating. Then, only reject work that you are positive are from someone who wasn't trying to give honest feedback.

What Adam AWS did not mention is when you block a worker using the requester interface, this will cause Amazon to sometimes send a threatening email to the worker telling them their work is not up to par and their worker account could be banned from future work. While you are helping Amazon police their platform, your requester account reputation is getting demolished on requester review sites and forums further leading to the unwanted emails and bullying. 

I agree with the second part, send them to spam in your email. PLEASE keep in mind these are a minority of workers. It also sounds like you were using ambiguous checks to define bad data although it does sound like you got some bad workers. 83% did do quality work!

We can beat this dead horse one more time I guess.

There is NO reason for Amazon to tell workers a requester banned/blocked them since whenever the worker inquires about it, Amazon gives them a form letter saying they cannot disclose the reason but are more than willing to send a threatening email with your requester name attached."
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Best way to deal with workers bullying me into paying
Hello,

We propose you utilize our Custom Qualifications feature to create a Qualification that will act like a filter, and make it a requirement on your HITs that Workers “have not been granted” that Custom Qualification in order to participate. This accomplishes a similar end goal, without the potential message regarding disciplinary action from the block function. The only caveat being that you must continually apply this filter to your HITs and any Workers you want to block in order prevent those with the Custom Qualification from accessing any subsequent HITs you publish.

However, I think it’s important that Requesters make use of the block feature in situations where it’s appropriate to do so. It’s meant to be used in those situations where allowing a Worker to continue would be not just unhelpful but detrimental to your process or your data.

If you have any other questions or concerns please contact us at mturk-requester-support@amazon.com."

AWS Training & Certification	"Qualification test before bounding box HIT?
I'm working on posting a bounding box HIT, but I'd like to include a qualification test before workers can begin the task.
My idea is to post one image with known ground-truth bounding boxes, let the workers annotate the image, and then if their bounding boxes are sufficiently similar to ground-truth (by looking at IOU and box centroids), then allow them to continue to the rest of the images.

AWS Training & Certification	"Is there a way to create a ""hidden"" HIT through API?
Hi all,

I'm wondering whether we can use API to create a HIT that is ""hidden"", i.e. only workers who meet the qualification can see and preview this HIT?

I noticed that this can be done through the requester interface by picking the ""hidden"" option in the ""HIT visibility"" section. However, I haven't found an equivalent way to do so through the API yet. I understand that we can set a ""private"" value to be true for a qualification in the API, but I feel this action is equivalent to pick the ""private"" option in the ""HIT visibility"" section on the requester interface, which means that all workers can see the HIT, but only qualified workers can preview and take the HIT. 

Your kind help is really appreciated! Thanks in advance!"
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Is there a way to create a ""hidden"" HIT through API?
You can create HITs through the API that use the Hidden HIT Visibility setting by getting the HITType ID out of the project API information popup and then calling CreateHIT with it.

After creating a project with the settings you want, click on the project name at https://requester.mturk.com/create/projects.

In the popup, you'll see the HITType ID.

You can then call CreateHIT and pass that ID into the HITTypeId parameter. These HITs will have the same HIT Visibility settings as your project (in addition to the other HITType settings such as title, description auto-approval delay, etc).

The popup also contains the Layout ID and Layout Parameters (if any). You can use these to create HITs through the API that use the same layout and input parameters as your project. For more information about HITLayouts, please refer to the  HITLayout documentation .

I attached screenshots showing where to click on the project name and what you'll see in the popup.

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Is there a way to create a ""hidden"" HIT through API?
There isn't a version of the createHITs method that takes in a HITTypeId, but you could refer to the code inside the below version of createHITs in RequesterService to see how it calls createHITAsync with the hitTypeForBatch variable it gets after calling registerHITType. It uses the .properties, .input, .question, and .success files. You could write similar code to do this with the HITTypeId you get from the Requester website instead of populating most of the HITProperties via the properties file. You would still need to pass in the MaxAssignments and LifetimeInSeconds values (assignments and hitlifetime values from the .properties file) to your createHITAsync call. 

public HIT[] createHITs(HITDataInput input, HITProperties props, HITQuestion question, int numHITToLoad, HITDataOutput success, HITDataOutput failure)

Thanks for your interest in Amazon Mechanical Turk! We have many templates on our website to help new Requesters get started on their projects. For yours, I would recommend the ""Collect Data"" template, which you can access by going to the ""Create"" page. If you haven't made any HITs yet, the New Project template list should be the first thing you see.

It's important to note that, though we provide a pre-fabricated task for this type of project, you will need to customize the template to match your specific needs. This will require editing the HTML source code of the HIT in order for it to function as intended. While it is a third-party website and isn't affiliated with Amazon, I personally use https://www.w3schools.com/ as a reference for certain actions that I need to perform using HTML and CSS. There are often references for JavaScript included in their tutorials for more advanced features.

Essentially, you would be creating a list of website names in a CSV file under a single header. That header would correspond to a piece of code in your HIT called a variable. The system is going to look at your CSV file filled with the names of those companies, and for every row, it's going to create a HIT by replacing the variable in the template you edited. If you have 100 companies, the system is going to do that 100 times until you have 100 individual tasks for Workers to complete.

Note that HITs and assignments are different - a HIT is one instance of the task you're creating, whereas the assignment is a single Worker completing that HIT. If you want redundancy in the information you're getting, you could (for instance) say you want three Workers to do each one of your tasks. This means you would set your assignment count to three. Using the same example as above, when the system makes those 100 HITs, it's going to make three assignments available for each one of those, for a total of 300 assignments. 

I'm including some information to help you get started. I understand it's a lot of information to absorb all at once, but it's definitely important to take your time and review it to get the best understanding of the task at hand.

AWS Training & Certification	"Question submitting website data request
Hi everyone, 

I'm new to mechanical turk and am having trouble with my first request. 

I have a website with 31 companies listed on it (https://nrfbigshow.nrf.com/startup-zone). Each company has it's logo on the site, which is hyperlinked to the company's website. I would like to have the Company Name, URL, a brief description and headquarters location listed for each. 

I'm having trouble figuring out how to list the 31 companies under one HIT. Do I need to list 31 different form fields for each element I'm requesting? How do I pay for this? I was thinking of offering about $10 for the request (should take less than an hour). Should I post list $0.33 each, or $10 for one HIT? 

Any help would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks, 

Chris"
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Question submitting website data request
From another requester's point of view, if this is something that you yourself could complete in an hour, I'd suggest you just look them up yourself.  If on the other hand, there were hundreds of companies you needed to look up and it was going to take you several days to do yourself, then maybe you would use mturk to do it.

But to more directly answer your question, I would think that you would want to have 31 different HITs.  Keep the basic properties of the HIT the same, and put the company names in the details.  In that way the HITs will get presented as a ""batch"".   Post just one HIT at first and see if you get the results you like.  If you aren't happy with the results, try adjusting the instructions.  You could set up a ""negative qualification"" that you grant to workers that you don't want to do your HITs again.  Once you find a worker that is producing the results you like, you might assign all the remaining ones to that specific worker.

As far as pay goes, you'll get what you pay for.  If you want your descriptions to sound like something that a user rushed to get done in two to three minutes, paying $0.31 would be about right.

To make HITs show up as a batch, the properties listed below should be the same:

Title
Description
Keywords
Reward
AssignmentDurationInSeconds
AutoApprovalDelayInSeconds
Qualifications"
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Question submitting website data request
Thanks for the reply, userbob!

Normally I would do this myself, but there are other pages I want to do the same thing for in the hundreds, which would take several hours. And there are a bunch of them, so if I can get this right I easily have days worth of work on my hands. This request is really just a test. 

I thought of putting the company name in the request, but if I take the time to go through the entire list and type out the company name, I may as well just do the rest of it. Again, not a big deal for this request, but when I get to larger pages, it's a significant amount of work. The other way I was thinking about doing this was having one HIT with 31 form field entries, but that won't scale well at all. 

For the pay, the description should just be cut and paste from the website. I have done this myself many times and it takes about 30 seconds per company once your'e in the groove. So for someone good at this, it could take as little as 20 minutes. I tripled the time to try to make it fair (and worth someone's while). Again, when I get into the larger pages and several hours time, I think the numbers will make more sense. Does that sound right? 

Thank you for the help!

Chris"
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Question submitting website data request
That sounds good.  You'll definitely need to find out how to start a batch of HITs.   Because it sounds like it would take longer to create a single HIT than it would to do one.   I'm not familiar with using the mturk web site for creating HITs.  I create mine programmatically using java and the mturk API."
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Question submitting website data request
Hello vfChris,

Thanks for asking about this! Userbob certainly has some good suggestions, one I want to call attention to is breaking your data up into individual pieces. As you're using the website and looking over our available templates for data collection, you may notice that each of those is purpose-built to provide information for one instance of the task you're designing.

You can customize these templates to include as many websites as you would like to per individual task, but keep in mind, the simple and most straight-forward tasks often come away with the best results. Should you choose to move forward with that design, you would need to include a unique variable for each individual piece of information that you're trying to provide in the HIT. For whatever data you need back from the Worker, you would then include a unique input field for that purpose.

There are two blog posts we've published that you may find helpful as you're designing this task. The first is a tutorial on how to go about gathering data on Mechanical Turk, and the second is an explanation of how variables function in your HIT with CSV files.

AWS Training & Certification	"Workers Cannot find the HIT
Hi,

I have created a HIT in the live environment using the python boto API but the workers are not able to find it.
The HIT requires some qualifications and even though I grant the worker the qualification they still cannot find it.
Is it because they have just created a new worker account? 

It happened to me when I signed in as a worker but it got resolved after an hour. So if that is the case, how long does it take to activate the worker's account?

Omnia"
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Workers Cannot find the HIT
I got an answer from Arrin at Amazon MTurk team as follows:

 
When Workers aren't able to see your HIT, it's generally because one of the reasons below:


Worker doesn't hold the Qualifications necessary to see the HIT
All available assignments have already been accepted by other Workers
You have your reward set to $0, and the search function is set to find HITs that offer at least $0.01 as a reward.


Since your HITs all of a $0 reward, this is most likely the reason for why the Workers don't see the HITs when searching. They will need to change their search filters to find your HITs."

Hello,

To provide a quick comment on batched HITs - that's correct. HITs that share the same properties will be batched together when you publish them. However, you can differentiate each set of HITs by using unique tags on those HITs. As long as there is one differential among your HITs, they will be batched separately.

I am new to MTurk.  For our survey, we want participants to download a ""diary"" template, which they can print out hard copies of, and then carry a copy with them to fill out during the day, over a 7-day period.  (We will ask for no PII beyond the subject's MTurk ID.)  Afterwards, we'd like participants to scan their completed diaries and upload them so that we may access them.

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Can subjects download a survey form and then upload the completed form?
Hello jezCID,

This is Adam from the Amazon Mechanical Turk support team. We've published a guide on our blog for enabling an upload option in your HITs, so that Workers can provide you with files directly.

This process uses S3 and Cognito to ensure that information is transmitted and stored securely.

Tutorial: How to create HITs that ask Workers to upload files using Amazon Cognito and Amazon S3:
https://blog.mturk.com/tutorial-how-to-create-hits-that-ask-workers-to-upload-files-using-amazon-cognito-and-amazon-s3-38acb1108633

Keep in mind that Worker participation is voluntary; there's no mechanism to ensure that a Worker will return after those 7 days with the information you're expecting. What you might consider as an alternative is to create a daily upload as opposed to a weekly one, so that you can provide incentive on a daily basis to keep up with the task requirements. 

You can use Custom Qualifications to gate participation, ensuring only the Workers who first participated in your task can continue on with it.

For more information on Custom Qualifications, you can check out or documentation listed below:

If I could trouble you with a follow-up question, we're still unsure about how we can get participants to accept or sign a Consent to Participate form before taking the survey.

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Can subjects download a survey form and then upload the completed form?
Ultimately how you present your consent form, or the contents of your consent form, are dependent on your organization and their requirements. Additionally, our Policies prohibit any collection of Personally Identifiable information. If your consent form requires written acknowledgment via a signature or disclosure of an individual's name for instance, it would breach those policies.

However, you have a couple different options for how you can proceed. One thing you could consider doing is setting up a Qualification Test which would include your consent form, and by completing that Qualification Test, the worker signifies their consent to participation. From there you would grant a Custom Qualification representing that consent to the Worker, and you could make that Custom Qualification a requirement on your HITs. 

Utilizing Qualification Tests will require using the API tools to fabricate, however, and the API is currently the only way to approve Qualification requests.

If your requirements are not so stringent, I have also seen Requesters provide the consent form just as a declaration in the task itself, so that by participating, a Worker is agreeing to the consent form.

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Need to implement a 10x10 grid to ensure no two answers are the same
Hello,

Thanks for your patience while we worked on this. There are two ways to do this, if we are correct in understanding that you want Workers to update a live document (or a document that will perform a live update while Workers complete aspects of it).

The first way is to link to a public Google spreadsheet. In this approach, you're allowing any Worker to modify any part of the spreadsheet. The caveat here is that there is no restriction on how Workers interact with that spreadsheet, so you'll be taking a chance that they complete it successfully and accurately.

The second option is to set up an external question. You will need to set up your own database  for this, and server, and record each Workers' answer into your database as Workers complete your HIT.

For more information on ExternalQuestion HITs, please see our documentation linked below:

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Need to implement a 10x10 grid to ensure no two answers are the same
OK, how will I be charged for linking to a google spreadsheet? That solution is easiest however will the 10x10 grid count as one HIT? I imagine it would be 100 HITs."
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Need to implement a 10x10 grid to ensure no two answers are the same
Hello,

A HIT is a single instance of your overall project type, with an assignment being a single unique Worker completing that task. You can certainly design your project to have multiple different HITs, or you can have a single HIT that you request multiple assignments for. It depends on how you would personally like to structure that design.

Our fees are based on the reward amount you offer for the completion of your HIT, and the number of assignments included in any HIT that you publish. Additional fees will apply if you use Premium Qualifications on your HIT.

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Recover money from unanswered hits
Hello,

When you pre-pay for a HIT, you're adding funds to your account to cover the potential cost of that HIT if you receive and approve every assignment you've requested.

When you cancel a HIT, no new Workers will be able to accept assignments from that HIT. However, any Workers who already accepted it would be able to continue working on it and then submit it to you for review. Your funds will remain held to provide payment to Workers until there are no more assignments held by Workers, no more assignments left for you to review, and you have no live HITs.

If you have funds left after those circumstances are met, you can confirm by visiting the ""My Account"" page (https://requester.mturk.com/account), and looking at your balance details. Your Liability (funds held to provide payment) would be at $0.

I am running a complicated HIT that has some workers running into errors.  I'd like to still be able to pay them through Mturk, so I decided the best way would be to create a simple 1 item hit with a ""back pay"" qualification that I would give them.  

They would request the ""back pay"" qualification if they ran into an error, and I would approve it so that they could take the easy hit to get paid.

I'm having this same issue, is there anyone who can answer this question?"
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Request this Qualification broken?
This feature is unfortunately not available in the UI. In order to grant Workers the qualification requested, you need to gather which Workers requested the qualification either though the CLT commands or the APIs.  You would need to use the GetQualificatonRequest operation.  This operation will give you all the Workers that requested your qualification type.   

If you are using the UI and not comfortable with writing code, the CLT tools are pretty to download and run from a command prompt.  

I'm not sure if you want to unreject assignments that have already been rejected.  You can do this by contacting customer support (https://requester.mturk.com/contactus) with the assignment IDs you would like to unreject.  Make sure you have enough funds in your account to pay for the assignments."
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Request this Qualification broken?
Seven years later, unfortunately, but there is a solution for this!  And it does NOT involve using the API!  Short answer (if you know how to do a couple things already):
1. Create a custom qualification
2. Create a new project with just a text field or question where they agree that they are, in fact, the workerID that has been approved for the make-up HIT (you can put in instructions that all other workerIDs will be rejected).  Put in custom qualification as necessary qualification.
3. To get to a worker's web page that has never submitted for you before, go to:
https://requester.mturk.com/workers/{enter workerID here}
You will be able to assign your custom qualification to them!
NOTE (If workerID has submitted for you before, you can assign the qualification by going to Manage>workers and then finding their workerID and assigning the qualification.

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Accurate Work Time estimates?
Hello again Claude!

There isn't currently a metric recorded for active time spent on a task. WorkTimeInSeconds is how long a Worker has spent with the HIT, from the time they accept the HIT to the time they finish working on that HIT. 

Depending on the type of task you're using, there may be other tools you can use to find this information. Many Requesters who utilize external surveys on the website like to use Qualtrics, who provide a timer (or a feature to include one) for the amount of time it takes a Worker to complete the survey from the moment they access it. At least for surveys, this may be more in line with what you're looking for. 

You could also ask Workers to time themselves as part of your instructions, though this may not prove as accurate as the other options.

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Prevent workers to complete more then one of my hits
Hello,

Thanks for this question! By design, the system allows a Worker to accept one assignment from any HIT that you publish. So theoretically, if you publish ten HITs at one assignment per HIT, a single Worker could accept all ten of those assignments from each different HIT.

The best way to prevent that from happening is to create and then grant a Custom Qualification to any Workers who have participated in your HITs. Then, on any subsequent HITs you publish, make it a requirement that your Custom Qualification ""has not been granted.""

This will ensure that anyone with your Custom Qualification will be automatically disqualified from accepting more HITs.

The problem here, as you may have already identified, is this only really works when you're not publishing HITs simultaneously. You would need to publish one HIT at a time, grant the Custom Qualification to the Worker who completed that HIT, and then publish the next HIT with that Qualification restriction.

Here’s a guide we’ve published on creating Qualifications:

Hello abriels,

Thanks for asking this question! We have a pre-made task template referred to as the ""Survey-link"" template, which allows you to link Workers on Mechanical Turk to a survey that you've created on an external site. We also have a tutorial for using Google Forms with this template that we published on our blog.

The Survey-Link template is customizable, though getting the introduction you want in just the manner you want it will require some HTML knowledge to properly format.

The more difficult aspect of this will be targeting individuals within the specific criteria that you need. We don't currently have any Premium Qualifications (which are essentially our demographic filters) that will allow you to narrow your eligible participants to those who like to shop fashionably. 

You have two options for how to proceed here - you can create a demographic survey prior to publishing your main survey, so that you can find those eligible participants. Then you can create and grant them a Custom Qualification of your own design, setting that Custom Qualification as a requirement (has been granted) on your main survey. This way, only individuals who have that Custom Qualification will be able to participate.

The second option would be to include a brief screening questionnaire in your survey to gather that information.

In addition to directing Turks to an external survey site such as SurveyMonkey and having them take a qualifying test, is there any payment required for turks who are rejected? I would also like to avoid any negative feedback for Turks who take a very brief qualifying survey and are rejected. Specifically, I will need a certain number of turks in each of several age groups (which do not correspond to the Turks age groups) as well as turks who hold at least a moderately strong opinion on a political issues (their is no point in them continuing if they do not currently hold an opinion). Suppose I have secured enough Turks who are age 28 or below and would like to reject the next Turk who is age 28 or below? Or need to reject a Turk who holds no or a neutral opinion on the political issue I am studying? 
Any help here is much appreciated.

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Create Project for External Survey
@UnivSDPaul, I would price your HIT based on an amount you are willing to pay people to answer your screener questions.  For example $0.01.   If a worker does not match your current needs after answering your screener questions, you just pay them the $0.01.   If they do match what you are looking for, you can tell them how long you expect it for them to complete the rest of your survey and how much you will pay them.  Any one that does complete your full survey, you'd pay using a bonus.   Alternatively, you could use two HITs.  The first one is just the qualifier questions.  The second is the complete survey.   You would qualify the users who completed your screener questions in the first HIT to your liking to do the second HIT.

In this way, you don't reject any one.  Users don't like rejections because it limits what other HITs they are allowed to do because the best HITs only allow users with a 99% approval rating to work on them. If you were to reject users as you suggested, users will rate you poorly on turkopticon.ucsd.edu and then you'll have a harder time getting users to accept your HITs in the future."

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: External Submit Post page stuck on ""Loading next hit""
I'm also encountering the same problem - it hangs on ""Loading next HIT"", .  Initially I thought it was because my externalSubmit URL was still pointing at workersandbox.mturk.com instead of worker.mturk.com, but I fixed that bug and still have the problem.  Console errors include only ""The following error (Failed to execute 'postMessage' on 'DOMWindow') is expected, please do not report"", and the POST to https://worker.mturk.com/mturk/externalSubmit completes with a 200 OK status.  On the worker end, the HIT went into my HIT Queue and is still being listed as being worked, and on the AWS CLI, it shows as HITStatus=Unassignable, HITReviewStatus=NotReviewed, NumberOfAssignmentsPending=1 (with 0 Available/Completed).  It does not show up as reviewable when making the API call to retrieve results.

Still running into this.  Further investigation:
It's not length limits.  I was curious if this could cause it since my HIT submits about 200K as its result, but I changed it to a dummy message that's just 20 bytes or so and it still fails.
It's not a missing or misformatted assignmentId; I checked the request and everything matched, with proper capitalization.
It's not a browser or extension issue; I tried with all of Chrome, Safari, and Brave and they all exhibited this behavior.
There are other ExternalSubmit HITs on MTurk that do work - I tried and submitted some as a Turker and they were successfully approved.  They submit to the same URL, with the same form data formatting, as I was."

I think I found the problem (at least for me; no idea if this was the cause of the other poster's problems).  I was submitting to https://worker.mturk.com/mturk/externalSubmit; the correct URL is https://www.mturk.com/mturk/externalSubmit.

AWS Training & Certification	"Mturk Account Suspended - LONG Time HIT poster
Very frustrated that we got a message today saying workers had flagged our account for violating Mturk policies and it was suspended. I'd guess we've submitted in the 100,000 HITs range over last 4-5 years and it's suspended over the ""say so"" of a couple people? We have zero idea what they said, why they think violates TOS (it doesn't). Our guess is because we raised pay recently we are getting LOTs of scammers so blocks have gone way up. That's likely who is flagging.

Just can't believe over the $thousands we spend per year on Mturk that it's yanked that quickly. I expect to get it resolved but the Mturk Support is some kind of stepchild to rest of Amazon's services. So far only way to communicate is if we respond by using the same email address as our Mturk account is using. Um, that's 1990's and considering our email is an ALIAS since we didn't want it exposed when first signed up, we can't respond from that email address. Geez guys.

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Mturk Account Suspended - LONG Time HIT poster
We appreciate the response, but still looking for resolution. The knee jerk response keeps being ""...our security policies..."". No one has actually said how our HITs violated the Amazon Security policies, they do not. Some disgruntled workers complained I guess and someone took their say so. But also if we really dig into even someone accidentally disclosing personal info, which is what a response said to us yesterday and isn't what the TOS says since that happens every day all over the place including:

1. Amazon's own messaging service violates their TOS. Though it is ""anonymous"" only when it's first sent by Worker. Then it comes as an email to us which completely discloses a Workers info. Unlike Craigslist which keeps all communications with a unique email address Mturk does not. And if we respond, now they have ours. Over the years we've received phone calls at our office and I regularly get emails with my first name from Turkers all because they initially used the link to contact a Requester.

2. Do we realize that all those HITs that require visits to a website COULD be semi traced back to someone via their IP address, cookies, etc? That's why the TOS says ""Workers cannot be REQUIRED to disclose info"" because the writers understand that accidental disclosure is inevitable.

Guys, a large reason for the spirit of the non-disclosure of the personal info is so Requesters dont try to hire Workers directly. After 5 years and over 1,100 workers through the API, we aren't doing that at all. Cannot believe we are not also looking at that.

BTW do you know how many Workers send us a message encouraging us to do that to save fees? And we have no recourse other than to block them (well, only if they have actually done one of our HITs in the 1st place since we incredibly cannot block beforehand. So Requesters cannot warn other Requesters not to use Worker X)

Very frustrating since we use this every day and are at a stupid standstill over...not sure what. It seems the flagging of some Workers that were probably blocked for submitting ""unseen evidence exists spatial flags careful"". The type of gibberish response we get DAILY and sift through and deal with. Now that same Workers has evidently helped lead to our service being suspended???"

Hello,

Thanks for writing in to us about this. I completely understand that you'd prefer not to add funds to the account in order to extend the HIT. Unfortunately, it's not possible to extend a HIT without doing so. The system sees extending the HIT as publishing the HIT again, and as such, you would need to add funds equivalent to the original cost of the HIT to extend it.

It's important to note, however, that these funds aren't actually used when you extend the HIT. As soon as the operation to extend has been completed and that transaction has been fully processed, we can issue a refund of the extra balance you provided to extend that HIT.

Instead of being ""HITLayoutId"" in your code, it's ""HITLayoutId "" - as far as the API is concerned, this is treated effectively as if there is no HITLayoutId. If you remove that erroneous space, you should be able to call CreateHITWithHITType successfully.

Thanks for your patience awhile we looked into this. 

1) Can I add <input> tags with my desired value, and do I need to embed them in a <form> tag (is there an existing <form> tag already surrounding the section)?

• If you're using the MTurk Requester website, then any HTML content in your template will automatically be surrounded by a <form> tag on save. 

Depending on your use case, you can surround the form inputs with your own <form> tag, which we'll detect and not inject an additional <form> tag.

If you want to render an input tag with a default value to show to your Worker, you can have an input element with the value attribute.

If you want a default value, but don't want to display anything to the Worker, you can use an input element with type ""hidden"".

For more info, please refer to external documentation for the input tag, for instance: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input

2) How do I get the value of the <input> tags to be outputted in the csv? Is this already defined in JQuery? 

• Mechanical Turk does not do anything special with the form data. You can use any native HTML form elements for your form data. See our documentation on HTMLQuestion for detail: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSMechTurk/latest/AWSMturkAPI/ApiReference_HTMLQuestionArticle.html

If you want the additional values for in the result CSV, but don't want to display it, you can use a hidden input.

3) Same as 2) for placeholders

• If you want to use the placeholder attribute for the input tag, you can. If you want to submit the placeholder text as a result, you'll need a hidden input. Again, this will work in exactly the same way as HTML forms work.

4) Will these inputs add up to the existing ones (worder ID ect.)?

•Yes.

Thanks again for your patience. Our engineering team has provided the following guidance for your request:

Mechanical Turk handles plain form-url-encoded form submissions. One way to achieve what you're looking for is to create a hidden input element for each field in ""myObject."" 

For instance, 
document.querySelector('form').addEventListener('submit', function() { 
for (prop in myObject) { 
var input = document.createElement('input'); 
input.type = 'hidden'; 
input.value = myObject[prop]; 
} 
});

AWS Training & Certification	"Uploading a screenshot (Image file) for every field in the form (42 fields)
Hello Everyone
We are trying to build a survey to get workers to check websites and answer questions in a 42 question survey. We have built the survey pretty much in Javascript and we have validations in each field to make sure is filled, have numbers when expected or urls when expected. 

As part of the instructions, we are asking workers to take a screenshot of the section of the site where they got the information from, so we need workers to upload at least 20 screenshots images (20 is the minimum you can fill as we have 20 required questions) and a maximum of 42 questions which is the survey total. Here is where we are having a huge challenge, we are following these instructions:

https://blog.mturk.com/tutorial-how-to-create-hits-that-ask-workers-to-upload-files-using-amazon-cognito-and-amazon-s3-38acb1108633

on the previous link, they seem to focus on uploading only one image, but when we try to replicate this for the 42 fields, it does not work properly. Firstable, we would love to have only one button to choose and upload the image, but there are two, one to select the file and another one to upload the image, then, if you choose a file on the 5th question, the file in the first field changes, so it obviously seems not suitable for this many images.

All the S3 and cognito bits are done, but it is not working for us.

AWS Training & Certification	"Regarding qualifications and the API
Hi all,
I have several questions and/or feature requests regarding qualifications used with the API.

1. Why is it possible to disable notifications to workers while associating qualifications, but not while disassociating qualifications from them?

2. On HIT creation, all qualification requirements are combined with the AND operation. Is it possible to combine them with OR?
In my case, I try to allow workers to work on my HITs if they either do not own qualification A OR have a specific value on qualification A if it is present.
I do not want to require them to perform a qualification request for A even if it is auto-granted since that is an additional step and many workers also prefilter HITs for HITs they are allowed to work on without any required qualification requests. 

Thank you for your answers in advance!

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Regarding qualifications and the API
Regarding #1, I agree that is annoying.  When I no longer want a user doing a HIT that I previously qualified them for, I set their qualification to a value other than the value I require."
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Regarding qualifications and the API
Thanks for your answer.
Yes that's a valid solution, but it does not solve my use case presented in the second question.
For example, assume I give workers a qualification with the value 1 if I don't want them to work on the HITs.
This means I want to allow access to all the workers which either don't own this qualification at all or have a value of 0 (or something else unequal to 1).

That's sadly not possible with the current API."
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Regarding qualifications and the API
Hello Webis,

That's a great question, and I'm happy to forward your feedback to our internal teams. We're always working on improving the experience of using the marketplace, and thoughtful questions like yours are great to hear.

For your second question, this is a limitation of the system. A Qualification requirement is essentially a logic check to see if a Qualification exists, and if it exists at a predetermined value. It cannot simultaneously be required to not have the Qualification, or to have the Qualification. I'm sorry for any difficulty or inconvenience that causes with your HIT designs, as I understand you want to ultimately require fewer steps for Workers.

There are different comparators that can be used to restrict Workers based on whether or not they have the Qualification - we generally recommend using ""Has been granted"" if you want only individuals who have a specific Qualification to participate. The inverse of this is using ""Has not been granted"", to ensure only individuals without the Qualification can participate. While this isn't a perfect answer to your second question, this can be an effective method of managing different groups of Workers as you've described.

If you have any other questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to write in to us at mturk-requester-support@amazon.com.

Thank you!"
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Regarding qualifications and the API
Thank you for you answer.
Yes, I tried using the ""Has not been granted"" approach, but this requires adding and removing qualifications from the workers.

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Allowing workers to take multiple surveys in HIT
Hello,

Thanks for asking this question. The reward amount that you offer Workers is static - when you create a HIT, you set a certain amount for the reward, and that reward amount is paid to the Worker when you approve their assignment.

Creating multiple fields for a Worker to input multiple different survey codes would just require copying and pasting the HTML source code for one input field, and then editing the parameters to make each one unique. That last part is super important, though! You want to make sure each input field is unique, so you can validate each survey code.

Once you do, you can provide a cumulative bonus to the Worker equivalent to the value of completing those extra surveys (to whatever degree you feel is appropriate).

That's correct - as you would be receiving multiple survey codes as individual answers for your HIT, you would need to validate each one and then manually send a bonus equal to the value you determine that number of surveys to be worth.

The only way around the manual pay-out of issuing bonuses would be to write a custom API call of your own design. This would require an AWS account, some coding knowledge, and using the API tools to complete that operation.

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Can I collect sample phone calls ?
I have seen HITs where two workers have a chat conversation, so technically it is probably possible.  However, mturk policies restrict requesters from posting HITs that require workers to provide personally identifiable information.  So asking for a phone number will scare most workers off.  But you could mention that users need to use a ""burner phone number"" (such as burnerapp.com) to complete your HIT.  That way the phone number wouldn't be considered personally identifiable information.

If you were only using mturk for one of the phone call participants and you were providing the other, the HIT would be much easier.  (you could use userbob.com and not have to develop anything) But needing two workers at the same time means that one is going to need to wait for the second worker to also accept your HIT.   You'll probably need to pay workers at a good rate to attract enough people so that they are both doing the HIT at the same time.

As far as creating it on mturk, I would think you'd probably need to implement it as an ""external question"" which basically allows you to develop a web page on your own server and then your web page gets iframed by the mturk page.  So the details of recording a phone conversation and uploading an audio file are not really specific to mturk - you could get any web developer to create that type of system for you."

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Restricting workers by race to the HIT
Hello,

Thanks for contacting Mechanical Turk! 

If you wish to restrict your HIT to certain race demographic, you can do so using our Custom Qualifications. Custom Qualifications allow you to restrict participation to your HIT based on the specific criteria in need. You would need to first find Workers that fit your criteria to grant the Qualification, which can be done in a few steps. The first step is to publish a demographic HIT first that all Workers are allowed to accept. Once you get submissions, you can review them to find Workers that fit your criteria to assign them the Custom Qualification. When you go to publish your actual task, you make it a requirement that Workers must have your Custom Qualification to accept.

You can find more information regarding our Qualifications here:
https://blog.mturk.com/tutorial-understanding-requirements-and-qualifications-99a26069fba2

Please note that asking Workers for basic demographic information is acceptable as long as your survey does not derive any personally identifiable information from Workers. For example, you may ask Workers for their occupation, relationship status, etc., but you may not ask Workers for personally identifiable information, such as their full name, email address, phone number, or equivalent in any HIT including survey HITs.

Thanks for your inquiry.  To validate an individual's certification credential, please contact us at https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/aws-training.  Provide us with the individual's first and last name, and if known, their email address.  A member of our team will assist you in verifying the certification.

Thanks,

Then, Why we need to pay US $175 for each exam and hide credentials in the closet? Why not display to public, because it is not worth it or very few only certified? I have received couple of resumes from vendor and in interview no clue for candidates on AWS terminology. Is it worth taking these exams for candidates and hide credentials in your closet? Like many software vendors you are not different. If candidate willing to choose to publish name in directory, just make it searchable. Can't you? Certification is a channel of making money than anything else. You advertise in a market to use your ""technology togo to market in hours globally”, why not your AWS itself?

Hi sreeboyapati,

Thank you for your feedback.  Individuals who earn an AWS Certification credential are able to highlight their certification credential and logo on their professional collateral, such as resumes, business cards, or LinkedIn profiles.  We also host a special AWS Certified community group on LinkedIn so that certified individuals can connect with their certified peers.  To validate someone's credential, you can ask for a copy of their certificate which shows the dates for which their AWS Certification is valid.  Alternatively, you can contact us and we can check our records: https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/aws-training/.

Thanks,
AWS Training & Certification"
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: How do you verify a person's AWS certification?
I would also like an authoritative, publicly accessible database for this sort of info provided by AWS.  It's trivial to reproduce the certificates and lie about having certification."
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: How do you verify a person's AWS certification?
We are now effectively staffing personnel for AWS projects. It would indeed be extremely handy to have a public way of simple checking the mentioned AWS certifications in resumes. ( Like this is the case in fe. Microsoft Certifications )"
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: How do you verify a person's AWS certification?
Seriously guys - you should really implement a directory where employers/prospects can verify and validate certifications. It's unbelievable the amount of 'certified' specialists that are taking advantage of this because you don't have an easy way for them to check.

For someone who really wants to pretend to be certified it'd be very easy to Photoshop their names in any certificate. 

With such an impressive service and infrastructure - and the amount you're making off certifications- it's unreal that you haven't done so already."
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: How do you verify a person's AWS certification?
(2016 updated) Simply speaking, although this question has been asked since 2 years ago, there is NO a dedicated website like https://www.youracclaim.com verifying and showing your AWS certification online in 2016. Please contact https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/aws-training to verify the certification program."
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: How do you verify a person's AWS certification?
I just want to chime in here, a public directory (like they do with Scrum certifications) is a must. We've had a number of candidates lie on their resume and add the AWS Certification logo...only to discover they had very little experience with AWS. We almost don't believe it anymore.

Your verification service at https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/aws-training/ says it can take up to 48hrs to respond...48 hours is often way too long for a recruiter to wait. Also, out last imposter had 3 AWS certifications, I would have had to fill out 3 forms.

If we are having this experience, I expect many others are too...the AWS Certification logo is probably  losing its credibility at this point."

Why Amazon??? WHY???? please  give us sensible and logical answer to this if there is a smart person working for AWS?  this question has been here almost 3 YEARS and Amazon does not give a bull about their certifications just grab their cert exam takers $$$ and then tell them to jog on ...WTF Amazon ? have some respect ? ..why did some poor souls want to take 5 Amazon certs that almost cost them $1000 , study hard like bunch of mofos just to pass the exams because it has lots of confusing, throw off words/misleading/ tricky/ word gaming/filler questions in them.., and then after they pass  they find no one can verify their AWS certs ?!!! ....just cheat and cost you nothin dude like AWS !! no one can catch you..Amazon is full of idiots ..thats why Google Cloud takes over now . Amazon customers and smart employees are moving to Google in droves daily  because Google is obviously smarter and makes more sense .not as much bulls like amazon produces..pathetic screw AWS certs Save your hard earned $$$ .. by the way ..I am the first person in this universe that have passed all 8 AWS certs including the speciality cert betas..

Apparently, AWS already has it the online database for verifying its certifications ..so no one can cheat anymore. Thank you for this AWS. The online database has been a while and just there on the internet. That's why AWS doesn't bother responding to this thread anymore.

Hey AWSbullshit,

You must be illiterate or something. The website aws.org is for the American Welding Society, and they have their own certification system. If you can find yourself there, then maybe you walked into the wrong examination booth.

However, it is funny that you can verify a certification for a non-technical occupation such as welding, and not for a cloud infrastructure provider.

If Amazon is not careful, Google and Azure will promote their certifications more and create an official database that you can query, and gain an edge that way."

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: How do you verify a person's AWS certification?
Now available!

If you have an AWS certification, you likely received an email earlier today to setup your new AWS  Training and Certification account and migrate/link to your old Webassessor Account. Here's the link to the new AWS Training & Certification site: https://www.aws.training/

To verify that someone is certified, you can now visit http://aws.amazon.com/verification and submit the Verification Number. Note, however, the certificate recipient first has to sign up for the new AWS Training & Certification site, link to his/her previous Webassessor account, after which AWS will issue a new cert PDF with the Verification Number. 

In the future, to verify ones certification, you can simply ask the recipient to email you the newly issued cert. On the cert itself includes the link to the verification page and Verification Number. 

P.S., AWS has changed the creative look and feel for certification badges (including the certification document itself)."
AWS Training & Certification	"Re: How do you verify a person's AWS certification?

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: How do you verify a person's AWS certification?
On your exam certificate, or by requesting this from the candidate, you will note a 
validation code: This is in the bottom right of the certificate. 
It is similar to this 16-character alphanumeric dummy code ->> ABC2DEF3GHI4JL1

You can validate the actual code here: 

You have to be logged in to the AWS console, then paste this: 
https://aw.certmetrics.com/amazon/public/verification.aspx
or paste this link
http://aws.amazon.com/verification

You will see a submit button and this text below 

""Please enter the validation code found at the bottom right of the AWS certificate. Click submit to verify the certification. Verification information is displayed above this text. After viewing the verification information, you may continue to use this form to verify additional certificates as needed.""

Enter the code and press submit. 
You will get this back if the certificate validation code is real. Check the name listed is the same as the candidate!
You can also ask the candidate for a copy of their exam results emailed by the exam center.

Hello LaurenEaws,

I landed up in a similar scenario today.. I don't clearly remember the message... but remember seeing... i have successfully passed the exam.. appears funny although... that I missed to note/remember the message. 

By the way I had solved the questions, I am very confident that I would have cleared the exam with good scores.  
The automated email that we get immediately after the exams can definitely state the result of the exam.

Going by the email thread, I understand that this feedback has been already shared with AWS Certification team. But, it would be good, if it is restated again.

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Fail and pass onscreen message?
I appeared for exam on 11th Oct and did receive result immediately as Passed on the testing screen. Mail from PSI Exams which got triggered immediately only stated that You’ve completed your AWS exam, nothing more.  

Reason for using this forum is to notify members that technical glitch (probably few of PSI servers went down) on 11th Oct 2018 between 1312-1315 Hrs IST or 0342-0355 hrs EST (10th Oct), resulted in candidates losing exam suddenly and exam going in suspended state. This was certainly not a local issue at PSI exam center. 

This was acknowledged by PSI exam support team to PSI exam center moderator and accordingly PSI servers were rebooted and candidate taking exam was requested to wait for some time. 

Soon after PSI servers were rebooted (entire process took about 15-25 min)  I was able to resume, my suspended exam and after it was completed and survey was filled out, it showed up , that I have successfully passed exam. 

I have logged a ticket  with AWS Training and certification Team (https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/aws-training/?src=aws_training_faqs?) as one of their FAQ around certification , does not cover scenarios, as to when will email simply state that you have completed exam and not show status. 

Above link was shared by AWS team member, at start of this thread and good part is that , it results in creation of reference (ticket) number so that you have a record, unlike PSI's portal (http://proctor2.psionline.com/aws.asp) where after filling out details, it only shows a message - ""A representative will be contacting you within 2 business days. 

Quoting from AWS Certification FAQ section:

Q. When will I get my exam Results ? 

After completing your exam, you will receive results immediately on the testing screen and in an email (sent to the email address in your AWS Certification Account profile). Within five business days of completing your exam, your AWS Certification Account will have a transcript of your exam results under “Achieved Certifications.”

Unquote: 

While we all understand score report will be available after 5 business days but should we not be getting result (with status as passed)  instantly on email too, which is in accordance with listed FAQ so either FAQ section should get modified.

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: Fail and pass onscreen message?
Unfortunately Proctor did not follow the rule. Ideally proctor should encourage candidates to fill out the survey, post which screen should show exam status as pass or fail. They generally have a passcode using which they unlock the screen, if it gets greyed out . Kindly wait for one more day as PSI support team will respond on that online query. Additionally raise a ticket with AWS training and certification team at following link mentioning that you were not advised by proctor  to fill out survey at end of exam, due to which you are unaware about result as screen got greyed out. 

Link for raising ticket with AWS Training and certification team is :

Good part is tool will generate a ticket number which starts with 2xxxx but standard response time their is also 2 - 3 business days. 

Can imagine how difficult is to live with dilemma around whether exam was cleared or not and that too because probably proctor did not follow the rule of encouraging candidate to fill out the survey.

Hello Janna,

I am also facing similar error 'Test taker is not associated with Promotion Code'

I received voucher code from AWS Certification Team on 1st July (via email). I actually reported my concern on this url (https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/aws-training/) and have 2 case numbers (00163100 and 00163053). But I didn't get any response yet.

Hi,
The Actual cost for taking the AWS CSA professional exam is $300 us. What is the saving by using the promotional code.

Hi, I have a similar problem, I am unable to register for the AWS SA Pro exam, as the coupon field is mandatory. I don't need a code, I just want to go ahead and take the exam.

I have tried to reach out to Kyterion at ktnsupport@kryteriononline.com, but they seem to have an autoresponder turned on that redirects me to AWS. I have raised multiple cases (00186116, 00185685) via AWS support, but there has been no response for several days. 

Will appreciate help with this. 

Thanks."
AWS Training & Certification	"PSI Exam experience
PSI have added extra exam locations in Australia which I was initially pleased to see as the availability for booking was much better in Brisbane. The actual experience was extremely frustrating though. It took 10-15 mins to get the ID to scan properly and for the person to verify the second piece while I held it up to the webcam. As another thread mentions, they think it is worthwhile interrupting you to tell you not to touch your face while you are concentrating. 

All of that I would have forgotten about though if near the end of my exam the thing didn't crash with an error saying that Cloudflare could not resolve the PSI sites DNS address anymore. They made me wait 20 mins while they investigated (chat is still working on the PC) then said sorry you will need to reschedule but don't worry it won't count as a failed exam.... What a crap experience, massive waste of my time and money."

AWS Training & Certification	"Re: PSI Exam experience
Hi

In relation to this bit..

""they think it is worthwhile interrupting you to tell you not to touch your face while you are concentrating""

I had a moderator do this continually throughout my exam for things like folding my arms! 

Steve"
AWS Training & Certification	"PSIexams remote moderator/terminator
Hi folks

Has anyone had a similar experience to this?

I'm sitting my Solutions Architect associate exam and the remote moderator is continually sending me pop messages telling me NOT to do things like
fold my arms
cover my mouth
let my hand briefly rest on my leg
silently mouth the words to a question on the screen.

I appreciate they give you a notice about rules that include not covering your mouth etc but I literally covered my mouth for a second and they were interrupting my exam with a popup chat message saying I risked getting a warning etc. I get that they can't let people try and cheat but this is a test center where I've been checked. It made me think the person doing the remote moderation either had zero empathy or was a complete simpleton. If PSI exams want to moderate exams like that then they should invest in some microphones and some extra cameras then perhaps I can do exams without constantly worrying about what I'm doing with my hands!
