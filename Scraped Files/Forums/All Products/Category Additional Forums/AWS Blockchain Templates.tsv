AWS Blockchain Templates	"Re: How to deploy a DAPP/smart contract to an ethereum network?
Hey there,

I was struggling with this yesterday and I made a small discovery that would make your life a lot easier. 

When you are setting up the Blockchain you have a section called Ethereum options that gives you a set of three addresses that are comma separated to start with. Chuck in your metamask public address and now that address is supplied with a good chunk of ether.

Once it has been created you take the RPC URL and connect to that network through metamask. This might require you to set up the SOCKS proxy on your own network in mac/win (Currently trying to get an API to work through which we can connect with keys). If it is all working well and swell you should now see that your address has the supplied ETH in that network. Mine sure does!

With this setup you can now deploy through remix by using your web injected metamask client. And transfer all the ETH from your account to any other accounts if required. 

Hope this helps a bit."

In case anyone is facing this issue.  Make sure you set up the prerequisites.
You need to create a private VPC and host it there and most likely you will need a bastion to access it thereafter.

AWS Blockchain Templates	"Feasibility of using blockchain technology
Hi

I'm investigating the feasibility of using blockchain technology in a proposed real-estate-rentals web application. Major features of the application are (a) the vetting of tenants based on rental-payment and credit history; and (b) the management of financial transactions between tenants/agents and agents/landlords. My understanding is that blockchain technology is suitable for applications in which there is a lack of a central arbiter of transactions. In a web application such as the rentals one I've described, there will be a central arbiter in the form of the application's business tier and relational database. Whereas blockchain solutions tend to be used in decentralised systems, most web applications are centralised, aren't they?

I have two questions. Is there a case for using blockchain technology in the scenario I've described? If so, what aspects of the application would be suitable, and why would this approach be superior to handling the aspects centrally?

Thanks

AWS Blockchain Templates	"Ethereum Storage Issues in ECS
I might be missing something but the Blockchain Templates for Ethereum are unusable with public networks at the moment. Geth stores it's data in ~/.ethereum inside the containers. If the node is attached to a public ethereum network like Ropsten or Mainnet, the size of the entire blockchain is 3-6 million blocks. A FAST sync'd geth node (fast is the default) requires about 75GB to be stored in this directory at the moment. Of course the container doesn't have this much storage and fills up pretty quickly. My nodes have only been able to reach 150,000-400,000 blocks before they stall.

I'm wondering why the template doesn't include an EFS mount and ECS volumes for storage? It seems like the template in it's current state is not able to sync with a public ethereum network. It also seems like using EFS could potentially have the benefit of being able to bootstrap autoscaled nodes so they don't have to go through the time consuming initial sync.

I'm happy to fork the Blockchain Templates for Ethereum to attempt to add this EFS mount, but it seems like that would involve manually downloading all the templates from S3 and manually merging them to my fork as they are updated, which isn't ideal. Would love if these templates were published to GitHub."
