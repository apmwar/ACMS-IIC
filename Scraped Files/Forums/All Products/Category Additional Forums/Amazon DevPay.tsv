Amazon DevPay	"Bugs affecting the console use of AWS Backup
I have just created our first backup service plan, hoping to decommision the old EFS-EFS CloudFormation-based backup solution that we have used for years. The backup has not run yet, so I am only sharing the first experience of creating the plan.

I have encountered several issues and bugs, and I would like to share those in hope someone at AWS wants to know of them to fix them:

1. IAM default roles were not created automatically. I had to create them manually, for which I have used the existing AWS-provided policies.

2. Two AWS KMS keys seem to have been created. One is called aws/cryotest and the other one is called aws/backup. This seems odd, especially the use of what looks like a codename (cryotest).

3. It is not possible to create a new backup vault using the aws/backup KMS key. The only appearing in the drop-down list is aws/cryotest, which, again, seems oddly named.

4. The UI for creating a backup rule ""recommends"" using a backup window. There is no reference anywhere in the UI to the window. Further, selecting the option seems to cause it to deselect itself upon a further visit to the plan and a time of 10pm is selected instead.

5. Setting one's own backup window, saving it, then produces ""NaN hours NaN minutes"" output in the console, see attached screenshot.

6. There are weird behaviours when trying to edit a rule while creating a plan, seems like the UI is out of synch with the options being selected. I recommend more thorough testing of the console.]

7. Selecting AWS Backup in the Console's ""Services"" pull-down menu brings a sales-y page suggesting I create a new backup plan, even though one already exists. It should take me straight to the list of the existing plans, in line with other AWS resources.

On another note, it would be good if the documentation was a little clearer about:
A. The purposes of the AWS Backup IAM role
B. Storage requirements considering having multiple backup rules. Specifically, do I double my storage requirements by having both a daily and a monthly rule in a single plan, or do they share a base snapshot of some sort and merely add their delta each time they run (EFS). This will have a considerable impact on the cost of using the service.

Overall, this console UI experience makes one concerned about the actual reliability of the backup itself, so I would recommend further, more intensive, testing on AWS side. After all, this is not a free and open source project—but I also hope that the API behind the scenes is more robust than the UI makes it seem.

Many thanks for introducing a potentially very useful service.

Amazon DevPay	"On-Premise Backup with Storage Gateway - how does it impact normal SG use?
I previously researched using Storage Gateway in VTL (Tape Library) mode to hook it up to Veeam, but now am curious if ""AWS Backup"" is a completely on-prem solution (not that I would dump Veeam).

If so, I think I understand Storage Gateways, but how exactly do I set AWS Backup for a Storage Gateway?  Do I create a ""Volume"" storage gateway, then associate it with AWS Backup?  If so, does AWS Backup work on top of what Storage Gateway already does (stores data in S3)?  Is it basically a management layer on moving the data around (lifespan)?  Or does ""AWS Backup"" work different from standard S3 storage via a Storage Gateway?

How do I get data into the volume on the Storage Gateway?  Mount iSCSI, use volume however I like, and ""AWS Backup"" will manage everything else?

I guess I'm hoping that it's that simple... use Storage Gateway as you normally would (in volume mode), which provides a mirrored copy of all data up in S3.  If a file is deleted locally, it's deleted in S3, etc...

My further hope is that ""AWS Backup"" sits on top of this, and once enabled, manages versions and archiving and lifecycle for that data... i.e. If a file is deleted locally, it still exists in AWS until the lifetime ages it out.

Thank you!

Corrected: ""Volume"" gateways support iSCSI, not SMB."
Amazon DevPay	"Re: On-Premise Backup with Storage Gateway - how does it impact normal SG use?
Hi Novox,

AWS Backup supports backing volumes of the Volume Gateway configuration of AWS Storage Gateway. The Volume Gateway presents block storage volumes to your applications using iSCSI connectivity. The data for these volumes is stored in Amazon S3 and you can take a snapshot of this data which is stored and can be accessed in the cloud as Amazon EBS snapshots. 

You can use AWS Backup to simplify taking backups of Volume Gateway volumes and set automatic retention to delete the backups. The backups taken by AWS Backup for Volume Gateway volumes are stored in Amazon EBS. Here is a link to Storage Gateway documentation chapter on backing your volumes using AWS Backup.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/backing-up-volumes.html

Hope this helps. If you have any other questions, please let us know.

Regards,
Bhavin"
Amazon DevPay	"Re: On-Premise Backup with Storage Gateway - how does it impact normal SG use?
Ok, so if I'm understanding you correctly, let's say I'm already using a Storage Gateway in ""Volume"" mode (with iSCSI connectivity).

If I DO NOT use AWS Backup with Storage Gateway, then the data in Storage Gateway is always my current data, unless I take manual snapshots via the console.

If I DO use ""AWS Backup,"" it works on-top of Storage Gateway to automatically manage the lifecycle of the data.  This manages how long to retain data (when it should be deleted), when it should move to cold storage (transition to glacier), etc.  Changes I make to my data between ""backup windows"" are committed when the backup runs (snapshot taken and lifecycle retention policy applied).

Please confirm I have this correct.

Thank you!

Amazon DevPay	"Re: On-Premise Backup with Storage Gateway - how does it impact normal SG use?
Hi Bill,

I have answered below to your questions.
If I DO NOT use AWS Backup with Storage Gateway, then the data in Storage Gateway is always my current data, unless I take manual snapshots via the console.

Bhavin>>> Data from your Storage Gateway running on-premises or in EC2 is asynchronously uploaded to the Storage Gateway service in the cloud. If you take manual snapshots, you will get a point in time image of your data and this data is stored in EBS as EBS snapshot. You can restore this snapshot if you ever had a need to go back in time. 

If I DO use ""AWS Backup,"" it works on-top of Storage Gateway to automatically manage the lifecycle of the data. This manages how long to retain data (when it should be deleted), when it should move to cold storage (transition to glacier), etc. Changes I make to my data between ""backup windows"" are committed when the backup runs (snapshot taken and lifecycle retention policy applied).

Bhavin>>> Using AWS Backup you can set policy to take backups of Storage Gateway volumes at pre-determined times and automatically delete them also. These copies of data taken by AWS Backup are also stored as EBS snapshots. You cannot transition them however to a colder storage tier.

Please let me know if I can help clarify anything else.

Regards,
Bhavin"
Amazon DevPay	"Re: On-Premise Backup with Storage Gateway - how does it impact normal SG use?
Understood.  If I may distill your response to a single sentence:

AWS Backup, when used with an on-prem Storage Gateway adds the ability to schedule snapshot creation, schedule data expiration, and eventually... schedule transition to ""cold storage"" (glacier).

Thank you,
~Bill"
Amazon DevPay	"Re: On-Premise Backup with Storage Gateway - how does it impact normal SG use?
Hi Bill,

Nice summary! On the last part, scheduling transition to Glacier is not available today for Storage Gateway volumes. If you could please PM me around your needs in that area, it will be great.

Bhavin"
Amazon DevPay	"Storage Gateway data can never transition to ""cold storage?""
ONLY Storage Gateways in ""Volume"" mode are able to be backed up via AWS Backup.

(""Q: What AWS Storage Gateway types can I manage through AWS Backup?

You can manage backup and retention policies for cached and stored volume modes of Volume Gateway through AWS Backup."" (https://aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/faqs/))

Also, Storage Gateway ""Volume"" backups are stored as EBS snapshots.

(""Storage Gateway volume backups taken from AWS Backup are stored in Amazon S3 as Amazon EBS snapshots."" (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/backing-up-volumes.html))

Also, EBS snapshots don't work with ""cold storage.""

(""Cold storage is currently supported for backups of EFS file systems only"" (https://aws.amazon.com/backup/pricing/)

Therefore, Storage Gateway Volume backups can never be transitioned to cold storage?

Please confirm?  If true, then any Storage Gateway backups will always be at the higher ""warm storage"" price of $0.05/GB and never the ""cold storage"" price of $0.01GB, correct?

Is there any way to use a Storage Gateway with ""cold storage?""  i.e. a File Storage Gateway using EFS to transition to ""cold storage.""

Amazon DevPay	"Re: Storage Gateway data can never transition to ""cold storage?""
That's rather disappointing.

Unfortunately, I'll need to wait to transition to AWS Backup on-premises because ""cold storage"" (glacier) isn't supported and I'd need to pay five times as much for archived data.

Amazon DevPay	"On-Premise Backup with Storage Gateway - how does it impact normal SG use?
I previously researched using Storage Gateway in VTL (Tape Library) mode to hook it up to Veeam, but now am curious if ""AWS Backup"" is a completely on-prem solution (not that I would dump Veeam).

If so, I think I understand Storage Gateways, but how exactly do I set AWS Backup for a Storage Gateway?  Do I create a ""Volume"" storage gateway, then associate it with AWS Backup?  If so, does AWS Backup work on top of what Storage Gateway already does (stores data in S3)?  Is it basically a management layer on moving the data around (lifespan)?  Or does ""AWS Backup"" work different from standard S3 storage via a Storage Gateway?

How do I get data into the volume on the Storage Gateway?  Mount iSCSI, use volume however I like, and ""AWS Backup"" will manage everything else?

I guess I'm hoping that it's that simple... use Storage Gateway as you normally would (in volume mode), which provides a mirrored copy of all data up in S3.  If a file is deleted locally, it's deleted in S3, etc...

My further hope is that ""AWS Backup"" sits on top of this, and once enabled, manages versions and archiving and lifecycle for that data... i.e. If a file is deleted locally, it still exists in AWS until the lifetime ages it out.

Thank you!

Corrected: ""Volume"" gateways support iSCSI, not SMB."
Amazon DevPay	"Re: On-Premise Backup with Storage Gateway - how does it impact normal SG use?
Hi Novox,

AWS Backup supports backing volumes of the Volume Gateway configuration of AWS Storage Gateway. The Volume Gateway presents block storage volumes to your applications using iSCSI connectivity. The data for these volumes is stored in Amazon S3 and you can take a snapshot of this data which is stored and can be accessed in the cloud as Amazon EBS snapshots. 

You can use AWS Backup to simplify taking backups of Volume Gateway volumes and set automatic retention to delete the backups. The backups taken by AWS Backup for Volume Gateway volumes are stored in Amazon EBS. Here is a link to Storage Gateway documentation chapter on backing your volumes using AWS Backup.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/backing-up-volumes.html

Hope this helps. If you have any other questions, please let us know.

Regards,
Bhavin"
Amazon DevPay	"Re: On-Premise Backup with Storage Gateway - how does it impact normal SG use?
Ok, so if I'm understanding you correctly, let's say I'm already using a Storage Gateway in ""Volume"" mode (with iSCSI connectivity).

If I DO NOT use AWS Backup with Storage Gateway, then the data in Storage Gateway is always my current data, unless I take manual snapshots via the console.

If I DO use ""AWS Backup,"" it works on-top of Storage Gateway to automatically manage the lifecycle of the data.  This manages how long to retain data (when it should be deleted), when it should move to cold storage (transition to glacier), etc.  Changes I make to my data between ""backup windows"" are committed when the backup runs (snapshot taken and lifecycle retention policy applied).

Please confirm I have this correct.

Thank you!

Amazon DevPay	"Re: On-Premise Backup with Storage Gateway - how does it impact normal SG use?
Hi Bill,

I have answered below to your questions.
If I DO NOT use AWS Backup with Storage Gateway, then the data in Storage Gateway is always my current data, unless I take manual snapshots via the console.

Bhavin>>> Data from your Storage Gateway running on-premises or in EC2 is asynchronously uploaded to the Storage Gateway service in the cloud. If you take manual snapshots, you will get a point in time image of your data and this data is stored in EBS as EBS snapshot. You can restore this snapshot if you ever had a need to go back in time. 

If I DO use ""AWS Backup,"" it works on-top of Storage Gateway to automatically manage the lifecycle of the data. This manages how long to retain data (when it should be deleted), when it should move to cold storage (transition to glacier), etc. Changes I make to my data between ""backup windows"" are committed when the backup runs (snapshot taken and lifecycle retention policy applied).

Bhavin>>> Using AWS Backup you can set policy to take backups of Storage Gateway volumes at pre-determined times and automatically delete them also. These copies of data taken by AWS Backup are also stored as EBS snapshots. You cannot transition them however to a colder storage tier.

Please let me know if I can help clarify anything else.

Regards,
Bhavin"
Amazon DevPay	"Re: On-Premise Backup with Storage Gateway - how does it impact normal SG use?
Understood.  If I may distill your response to a single sentence:

AWS Backup, when used with an on-prem Storage Gateway adds the ability to schedule snapshot creation, schedule data expiration, and eventually... schedule transition to ""cold storage"" (glacier).

Thank you,
~Bill"
Amazon DevPay	"Re: On-Premise Backup with Storage Gateway - how does it impact normal SG use?

Amazon DevPay	"Storage Gateway data can never transition to ""cold storage?""
ONLY Storage Gateways in ""Volume"" mode are able to be backed up via AWS Backup.

(""Q: What AWS Storage Gateway types can I manage through AWS Backup?

You can manage backup and retention policies for cached and stored volume modes of Volume Gateway through AWS Backup."" (https://aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/faqs/))

Also, Storage Gateway ""Volume"" backups are stored as EBS snapshots.

(""Storage Gateway volume backups taken from AWS Backup are stored in Amazon S3 as Amazon EBS snapshots."" (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/backing-up-volumes.html))

Also, EBS snapshots don't work with ""cold storage.""

(""Cold storage is currently supported for backups of EFS file systems only"" (https://aws.amazon.com/backup/pricing/)

Therefore, Storage Gateway Volume backups can never be transitioned to cold storage?

Please confirm?  If true, then any Storage Gateway backups will always be at the higher ""warm storage"" price of $0.05/GB and never the ""cold storage"" price of $0.01GB, correct?

Is there any way to use a Storage Gateway with ""cold storage?""  i.e. a File Storage Gateway using EFS to transition to ""cold storage.""

Amazon DevPay	"Re: Storage Gateway data can never transition to ""cold storage?""
That's rather disappointing.

Amazon DevPay	"Purchase URL leads to AWS signup page
In DavPay's FAQ it states

Q: Do my customers need to separately sign up for an AWS account?

To sign up and pay for your Amazon S3-based application, your customers use their trusted Amazon.com account credentials only – they do not need a separate AWS account, or Amazon S3 subscription.

However, the purchase URL is leading my clients to sign up for and AWS account instead of using their amazon.com account.

Here is the Purchase URL

Can you please open up the ability for other countries besides the states to use devpay?There is no reason to discriminate against other countries here - I mean believe it or not the states isn't the center of the universe.

Hi there,

As a first pass, you may want to enable the Detailed Billing Reports on your AWS Account, which will give you a full breakdown of each cost that has been charged on your account:

Amazon DevPay	"EC2 launch error disagrees with AMI and DevPay configuration
We have a set of AMIs that have been linked to DevPay successfully for several years. Our build process is completely automated, so putting out new versions (~monthly) has been no problem. The AMI has been available only for Linux on the high-CPU medium instance type. Recently, we added support for a Windows AMI running on a c3.xlarge instance. Running our private version (with no product code) works fine, but launching the public version from an un-associated account fails with the message:
""Unable to launch image ami-faf61692 as the product code 3AD42A5A is not supported for the specified region, instance type and operating system combination.""

I've included screenshots of the various configurations and the error message (the screenshots don't show what regions I'm trying to launch it in - but yes, I'm trying in US East). I'm a bit stuck now, as the message seems to conflict with what the AWS console and DevPay configurations are telling me.

Hi,

I have set the CORS properties on the DevPay bucket and tried to use a browser post request. However, the request fails when the browser sends the OPTIONS call for the preflight check. It is obvious that Amazon finds the bucket and even returns back the CORS information in the header (if I pass an invalid bucket, it returns an error saying bucket not found). 

For the OPTIONS call the response is simply a 403 with AccessDenied in the returned error XML response:

Hello!

I saw your comment on the AWS PHP Development blog. The PHP team doesn't normally follow this forum, which is why we did not get a chance to respond earlier to this post. In the future, if you have questions specific to the AWS SDK for PHP, please use the AWS PHP Development forum.

To accomplish what you are wanting to do, you will need to drop down into the Guzzle command syntax and modify the request that is being sent. Try doing something like this: $client = S3Client::factory(array(
    'key'    => $AccessKey,
    'secret' => $SecretKey,
));
 
try {
    // Create an S3 PutObject command
    $command = $client->getCommand('PutObject', array(
        'Bucket' => 'mybucket',
        'Key'    => basename($filename),
        'Body'   => fopen($filename, 'r'),
    ));
 
    // Add the token header for devpay to the request
    $request = $command->prepare();
    $request->setHeader('x-amz-security-token', $AmazonUserToken);
 
    // Execute the command and get the results
    $result = $command->getResult();
} catch(S3Exception $e) {
    die($e);
}
 You can also inspect the request and response to S3 by attaching the Guzzle LogPlugin to the client. You can do this right after you instantiate the client: $client->addSubscriber(\Guzzle\Plugin\Log\LogPlugin::getDebugPlugin());
 I hope this helps. I'm watching this thread now in case you have more questions."

Amazon DevPay	"Re: DevPay PHP S3 Client set security token
I finally figured out why I was getting the malformed/invalid token error.  The AWS access key and secret access key I used to activate the hosted product were different from the keys I was using to upload the object.

The other problem was that I did not create the bucket using the DevPay UserToken.  I had created it via my S3 account manually, so when I tried to put the object, the error message was ""Access Denied"".

The bucket has to be created with the UserToken before you can upload objects into it.  I think the UserToken can be used to create at most 100 buckets.

Here's the code to create the bucket (goes into the try block):

// Create an S3 CreateBucket command
$command = $client->getCommand('CreateBucket',
array(
'Bucket' => 'mybucket',
)
);

// Add the token header for devpay to the request
$request = $command->prepare();

Amazon DevPay	"Re: Why no white label solution?
So... 5 years later and where are we... 

Well they have http://webstore.amazon.com/?ld=ACLN but this seems to be for selling your own products... not most of us are looking for.

The astores are good if you know exactly what products you want to sell. ok... but time consuming. 

I have domains I am not doing anything with, I have traffic, I never understood why you couldn't just pick a few categories of what you want to sell then set up an astore that would automatically push products into it. 

I don't want to worry about products, ecommerce or shipping... just the traffic. 

Sadly most webmasters would even pay a yearly fee for a low maintenance solution that we could just drive traffic to.

Amazon DevPay	"Selling content from S3 Bucket?
Hi.  I'm totally new to Amazon S3 and DevPay.  I have been asked to make someone's S3 bucket (containing hundreds of MP3 files) for sale through their website.  I see that I can make products available for sale through DevPay, but I do not understand the instructions that Amazon has provided.  Basically, I want end users to come to the website, read a description of the product, and click on a button to buy it.  Once they pay, I want them to be able to download the files from the bucket.

Amazon DevPay	"any admins that can help with random Qs/pricing
Hi,

I was curious about the pricing aspect of the ec2 instances. My question is, is it possible to run one instance while having multiple developers work on it with the same configuration. I am sure this is possible, but just to have some solid facts would be great. 

Also, what would the price be for multiple developers using that instance with the same configuration? 

Does it vary for each AMI machine?
I know about the free t.micro subscription for one year, but I guess my question is, how much more expensive will it be with other developers all attacking the same instance?

Last question about any assumptions being made:

What if a developer leaves the instance on and forgets? What happens? Is there some policy or will there be consequences (paying more) for the developer? Any faqs would be greatly appreciated. 

I apologize for the long post.

Amazon DevPay	"Questions for migrating from DevPay to AWS Marketplace
We currently offer a paid AMI through DevPay.  We're interested in moving to AWS Marketplace, but we have some concerns about the AWS Marketplace pricing models.  I have emailed this question twice to AWS but I haven't received a response in a week, so I'm posting this with the hope that someone in the community may be able to answer this.

Currently, we offer a single paid AMI through DevPay at a flat hourly rate, but we're planning to move to sell the AMI in two different ways:

Plan A: A high hourly cost with no monthly commitment (ex: $25/hour)
Plan B: A lower hourly cost with a monthly commitment (ex: $2250/month, first 750 hours at $0/hr, additional hours at $5/hour)

I know that we can easily do this with DevPay, but I'm uncertain whether we can set this up in AWS Marketplace.  Specifically:

1. Can we setup different pricing tiers in AWS Marketplace, just like we can with DevPay?  Meaning, can we have a price with $0/hr for the first 750 machine-hours per month and $5/hr for the additional machine-hours.

2. How is the monthly fee pro-rated in case someone cancels?  We want to avoid letting someone signup for 1 day of ""plan B"", then cancel and pay just $2250/30 = $75.  With DevPay, we can discourage this by adding a sign-up fee, but we're also comfortable if the monthly fee is non-refundable.

3. Finally, if we decide that the business model of AWS Marketplace is too restrictive for us, what is the roadmap for DevPay? Is DevPay deprecated or due for retirement?

Thanks very much."

Amazon DevPay	"Re: Questions for migrating from DevPay to AWS Marketplace
Hi,
Let me see if I can answer your questions for you. 

First, on multiple price tiers, unfortunately AWS marketplace does not support price tiers at this time. 

Next, on your question about pro-rating the cost, monthly fees are pro-rated on the front end and back end. A customer signing up for a $2250 product for 1 day, would pay about $75. We charge them upfront, then credit their account when they cancel. 

Finally, on the question about the deprecation of DevPay, at this time we have nothing that we are ready to release on the deprecation of DevPay.

Please let us know if you have any further questions."

Amazon DevPay	"Choose an payment deployment scenario...
Not sure the best place to post this question, so sry if its a bit misplaced. we are planning a new software launch that we are considering AWS deployment. I have scaled in the AWS enviroment before at another company but this is a fresh startup so I want to cover my bases. Any advice/experience that anyone can provide would be awesome and really helpful! 

The concept is basic, we want to deploy a software/instance on a monthly subscription. Each client gets there own monthly package set at a bandwidth/usage cap, if they reach it they bump to the next level and we will move them from m1.small->med->large as needed (manual is needed). I realize that I can do a few things, 1) I can cap an AWS account at a certain allowance each month 2) I can use dev pay to pass the billing to the customer 3) I can use consolidated billing to merge several AWS accounts together for volume pricing. 

That said, DevPay is way too techy for our marketplace, the point of the software is ease of use, people managing their own AWS accounts, ugh, I really don't see this as a viable option. I like the consolidated billing approach a) we can lock accounts at monthly fee, with alerts b) we can have our customers pay us (we already have a billing system) and we can do the techy side to get them deployed an manage the account as part of the service. The problem (as I understand it) is you have to signup for each new AWS account for each customer (separate email/cc?) and then merge the account to consolidated billing, is this right? if this is the case, can we do this internally for each new account or is that a road block? is the process of sharing instances securely btw accounts easy or is that another hurdle to consider?

The last option is to just have one AWS account we own and spin private instances in that enviroment, keep things in s3 (including SQL dumps, since your caped on the number of EBS volumes) and move customers as needed to large instances. However, in my last project we discovered there really isn't an easy way of tracking billing per server, detailed cloudwatch stats are helpful but not so much with the business/billing aspect. I guess we could consolidate to one account and run nagios and script needed (which maybe the solution) but i'm looking for the best/easiest option for integrated type deployment and thought i'd throw this out see what I get back....

I also, see this guy which is interesting option but I don't know much about it.
http://ylastic.com/pricing.html

Thanks, any thoughts are really helpful. I have some experience here but we are planning on deploying and growing quickly so I want the billing automation/direction to match the scalability of the cloud, quick and easy (or at least over time, able to keep automating process). 

In summary, we want to collect a set monthly service fee (on our side, ideally) and each client will get a pre-configured AMI (manual, if needed) that they will be caped monthly (ie. a) 5GB Trans/25GB Storage, b) 10GB Trans 50GB Storage, etc... no tagging per hr charges, basically we want to balance our avg usage against our tier mo plans, in effort to make billing easier on the customer. My main question is what is the easiest way to track it all, when growing from 10-100 customers 100-1000, etc what is the best way fwd...

Thanks Again!!!

Amazon DevPay	"Customers can't activate: ""An error occurred attempting to generate a key""
We have been running a devpay product (Magento backup software) for over 2 years now without a hitch, suddenly as of the last couple of days new customers have complained of an error when trying to get an activation key:

""An error occurred attempting to generate a key for Magento Cloud Backup""

I attached a screenshot showing the issue - that's from a test signup I did on my personal amazon account, so it seems to be happening to all new customers.

We haven't made any code changes to the activation flow, and this seems to be only happening during the Amazon part of the signup flow, as it's before the customer pastes the key into our product.

Has something changed in the way DevPay is activated, is there actually an error that AWS are working to resolve?

Amazon DevPay	"Charge Customers for AMI up time
Hi,

So here is the situation:

My company would like to put together an AMI that comes loaded with preinstalled software. Since we normally charge for use of our software by the amount of its usage on non-cloud computers, it seems the most analogous way to charge for this on Amazon EC2 instances would be to charge per unit time the AMI is being used by the purchaser.

1) Is this possible via Amazon DevPay?

2) Can pricing be per hour, per minute, per day etc?

3) Can the pricing be different for different instance types? E.g. a micro would be cheaper than a small.

Thanks for any assistance."

Hi,

I started experimenting with multi-object delete and used the REST API with DevPay. I uploaded first 100 files and verified that they are there. Then, I requested to delete the same 100 files. The response came back as follows:

<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>
<DeleteResult xmlns=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/"">

Amazon DevPay	"Re: Multi-object delete leaves some objects

If you could give more information such as the request headers and response header we may be able to dig into this a bit further.

Hi Ryan,

The bucket name is cg--814885839-1311059649171.

I didn't fully capture the request headers and response headers for that specific request. However, I was under the impression that the response telling me that the object key deleted would be sufficient to confirm the deletion. I can repeat the process and send the full request headers, body and response headers and body.

I have not used a standard Application. I'm initiating the call using the rest API directly within Salesforce. So the code is pretty specific to their language. However, all calls from Salesforce have worked as expected for the last several years, except this one.

Amazon DevPay	"Re: Multi-object delete leaves some objects
Bulent,

How are you determining that the object is ""left over""?  I ask because I looked in your bucket and I was not able to find the object (where the following is an S3-style addressing of s3://<bucket>/<object> )

s3://cg--814885839-1311059649171/500800000085c3SAAQ/a068000000a1e56AAA/bell_add.png


I also looked for any key containing add.png and was unable to find any.  I'm wondering if the delete is succeeding, but you may be seeing the object as still present due to a facet of eventual consistency?  This is especially likely if you are deleting the key from the East Coast endpoints and then checking if it exists from the West Coast endpoints (as the US Classic region, where your bucket is located, has geographically separated endpoints).

We have an innovative AWS EC2 offering. It's a full blown, dedicated crontab/cron server with a painless, built-in, web-based user interface which allows creating & managing cron jobs in multiple languages (perl, php, ruby, python, bash). It's based on a modified Amazon Linux AMI, and is self-healing in that all cron jobs & server settings are synchronized to s3 and automatically reinstated on a new instance should the cron server instance fail. Client would also have the option to run the instance via Elastic Beanstalk to fully automate fail-over.

This makes great sense on the micro instance pricing level, and we think it would make an excellent addition to the AWS Marketplace & AWS Customer Apps.

We would like to offer it in the Wild, but at the small instance price I just don't think there's a market. I suppose we could offer it as a monthly SaaS, but the DevPay micro instance/AMI solution would be so much more convenient on so many levels.

Hi Tarun,This feature is useful when the user first lands on product's web site, the site collects some information about that user and redirects the user to the payment processor's web site (devpay in this case).

Amazon DevPay	"Re: Can I pass custom parameters with the purchase url?
I came across this thread while searching for ways to pass custom variables through Amazon Payments similar to PayPal's method.

See, my system was setup and worked solely with PayPal for many years, and now that I want to also offer Amazon Payments as another way to pay, I have to find workarounds for a ""feature"" that PayPal provides that Amazon does not. (consider this my feature request).

This is what I currently do with PayPal in my current live site:
1. Customer for my partner/third-party gaming site comes to my site and selects virtual products, quantities, a possible customization for the product, the recipient gaming account, and perhaps a bonus product from a coupon code.
2. My website submits the buynow form to paypal with these variables:
   description: 5,000 Mana for TrollFightr2
   invoice: 376c5c3bfdaf4c5b8d0547e29fe42379-595A64EB
   custom: 5000-TrollFightr2-blue05-00129954X-JulySB-b5b50bc847abc7668171f350e5ecdced

Using PayPal custom variables like this lets me accomplish a few key things that I have come to prefer. The description field appears in a user-friendly easily-readable phrase that can appear in online statements, status, receipts emails and word of mouth/re-post. The invoice number is a 2 part: session identifier (for web log/IP/history/debug) and a short transaction ID that I must later pass to the third-party delivery API on another company's server. That short ID will always stick with the result of the API of delivery status and time of the ordered virtual product. Also, when ever there is a problem, I just ask the customer for their invoice # and they copy and paste the whole shebang to me, and I can easily look up what they did online via session, and what they selected to buy, and I can check on that exact delivery status for the short ID part.
Perhaps most importantly, the custom variable lets me pack in un-user-friendly variables that I didn't want to specify in the description. In my example, the custom variable tells me quantity 5000, recipient TrollFightr2, the 5th-generation Blue type of mana, the bonus sword catalog number,  the coupon they used to select that sword, and a ""check-hash"" that is an MD5 of the variables so far plus perhaps a private key. See, I don't want to have all this in the user's face for at least cosmetic reasons. The custom variable does not appear anywhere visible to the user, not online nor receipt email.

3. IPN receives the description (not really used by IPN!), the invoice, and custom variable. The invoice and custom are processed and delivery is made, and results are saved to database.

Later if a customer says they have a problem and did not receive order X, they can specify their invoice number from the PayPal email receipt. Then I can lookup and see what happened. Note that this may be their 3rd time today, and 15th time this week ordering ""5,000 Mana for TrollFightr2"" so I can't just ask which user name they bought for. I can look up all 15 sure, but there might be an issue beyond the data I have, that I need more specificity for.

Also, keep in mind that on a gaming site, more than half of all order do not go to completion+payment. The user is merely testing the final prices, coupons, shopping around between sites, or even failing at the time of payment with wrong card numbers or lack of funds, etc. so I really don't want to log much of the custom variables ahead of time because its a waste of database hits AND space. Plus after payment when the IPN comes though I can deliver on the custom variables that came though the IPN, without building delivery from the database.

Right now with Amazon,  I only have the description variable that I can set and have to work with. So I'm looking at a workaround like description:""5,000 Mana for TrollFightr2 via order:100513""...
I don't like this for several reasons. I prefer to maintain user-friendly descriptions for email receipts and such, and while an order number is okay, I still want less. I couldn't use a large unique, unguessable invoice number that is subtle on PayPal statement and emails. An evil customer could try to guess short order numbers and say ""lets discuss order 100514."" Also I'd have to save and manage the custom build order of multiple products and/or customizations for every potential buyer, because I can't pass that via payment_form->IPN.

I know I can manage with the current Amazon Payments setup, but it will take much re-coding, where custom variables could be the common factor to save integration time.

Sorry for the long-winded explanation, but I want my feature request of custom Amazon variables to have a bit of real world example demand shown."

Amazon DevPay	"Charging for each bucket
I've built a hosted website product that runs from a single S3 bucket. I have a few questions/requests regarding this.

1. Can you use the S3 website feature with DevPay? Making the files public-read and using an index and error file and all that?

2. I want to charge $5/month for each bucket (website) they use (if they want to use multiple instances of my product).

This currently isn't possible. The workaround would be to create N versions of my product for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, Nth purchase and rotate customers through these as they purchase additional instances.

Please add support for DevPay to charge per-bucket prices. Just like charging for each EC2 instance provisioned.

3. It would be great to simply pass on the data costs of S3 to the customer (i.e. not set a price on the data over what Amazon charges). Then when S3 costs are lowered the customers immediately get the benefit. Could you please add a no-markup feature so the customer will always pay Amazon's data prices. This is great for products that want to simply use the monthly price to make money.

Sounds like this would allow developers to process a payment with just 4 pieces of information: credit card #, expiration, security code, billing address.  In contrast, the current process additionally requires the user's Amazon/Google account credentials (provided by the user directly to Amazon/Google).

If this were provided just like any other Amazon service, it would be ripe for abuse by credit card thieves.

Such a service could only be provided after vetting the identity/reputation of the developer. This process would necessarily rule out most garage startups and random developers. However, garage startups and random developers are the primary target market of AWS, so I do not expect Amazon to provide such a service any time soon."

I guess we'll just let S3 serve the html file for now.

One last thing for those who find this - If your bucket name has a period in it you will get an  SSL error due to the signed certificate is with S3.amazonaws.com and not ""bucket.name.s3.amazonaws.com

Amazon DevPay	"DevPay security issue -- are the AWS account credentials always needed?
We are developing a hosted application in which customers will be able to store data in S3 DevPay buckets. The host server therefore needs an access key id, secret key, and user token in order to access the bucket. There will be one bucket per customer.

In our tests, this only works if the calls to ActivateHostedProduct, to create the bucket, and to access the bucket, are all done with the access/secret keys of the AWS account to which the product is registered. If we try to use the access/secret keys of an IAM user -- one that has been granted the needed permissions in the ACL system, or even full permissions to everything in that AWS account -- it fails with an ""ExpiredToken"" error, with the message ""The provided token is malformed or otherwise invalid."" (My understanding is that this error doesn't necessarily mean an expired token, it happens whenever the token is invalid for any reason. Since the same access with the same code does work using the AWS account credentials, it can only be due to an access control issue in this case.)

Similarly it fails with the same error if the access/secret key used is that of a different AWS account, even when the DevPay bucket has been set to have a policy that allows public read/write access. But this seems to contradict an example in the DevPay documentation; the ""John's Mom"" example at http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonDevPay/latest/DevPayDeveloperGuide/index.html?DataIsolation.html , which seems to suggest that access (via the same product) should be permitted.

If we were to use the AWS account keys on each host server, then any compromise of one of those servers would allow the attacker to delete all our customer's data, perhaps holding it hostage by reading it first. (The data is encrypted and authenticated, so that is essentially all they can do, but it's bad enough.) This seems like a very serious weakness, and I can't see how to avoid it while still using DevPay. Note that signed URLs cannot solve this problem because the server generating those URLs would still need the AWS account credentials.

Another thing I don't understand is that the documentation suggests that the user token should be kept secret and even encrypted, but the API is designed so that unless TLS is used, it will be sent in the x-amz-secret-token header in the clear. It could easily have been designed so that the user token is used in place of or as well as the secret key, as a MAC key. We may have to switch to using TLS solely because of that design flaw, even though our data is already encrypted."
Amazon DevPay	"Re: DevPay security issue -- are the AWS account credentials always needed?
After reviewing the docs and our security requirements, we think that it may be better to use a desktop product rather than a hosted product. The server assigned to each user can then be treated as a ""desktop"". Unlike ActivateHostedProduct, the ActivateDesktopProduct request returns unique access/secret keys as well as the usertoken, which makes sense and allows the servers to use different keys. (It would probably be more accurate to call the hosted model ""centralized"" and the desktop model ""decentralized"", since that makes fewer assumptions about where the code runs.)

When we try this, the ActivateDesktopProduct call succeeds. However, when we try to use the access/secret keys it returns to create a bucket (also passing the usertoken in x-amz-security-token), we always get the ""token is malformed or otherwise invalid"" error. The same happens if we try to use the access/secret keys of the AWS account, unlike in the ActivateHostedProduct case.

There must be some way to create a DevPay bucket for a desktop product, so I'm probably missing something, but I can't see what it is."
Amazon DevPay	"Re: DevPay security issue -- are the AWS account credentials always needed?
The ""token is malformed or otherwise invalid"" error was solved by sending an extra x-amz-security-token header containing the product token (the long one that starts with ""{ProductToken}"", not the product code). The documentation is somewhat unclear that this differs between hosted and desktop products."

Amazon DevPay	"Working around international customers wanting to use DevPay
I've been a EC2 customer for a few years and have spoken on the benefits of cloud computing for a while. Part of this issue is deploying to EC2 for web based apps that were written with a single customer in mind and having that shift to the cloud. If you wrote it for something like SQL Server rewriting it for other platforms or if you have a low competitive price point for your product another solution may be needed. 

I am looking for open source contributors to help me on this project. If you are interested please contact me at glenn@orchardebusiness.com

Summary of the Issue to solve

If you have an ASP.NET or ISAPI application and way to easily deploy your web based application and you can host multiple copies of your application on the one Amazon service this tool will allow you to automate the provisions of your application.

If you are outside of the USA or cannot open a USA bank account you will not have access to DevPay and a service like this can help you take your services to the cloud in a more efficient manner.

Windows Web Development and the Cloud

Windows Web Applications are great? They are fun to develop and fun to work with regardless of whether you are writing ASP.NET or ISAPI based solutions. As developers for Windows based web applications it is good that we can create an EC2 instance put the files in the right place and voila our application is up and running in the cloud. Combine that with using services such as S3 for data storage and you get a great system that you can operate. 

So how about deployment

If you want to develop in the cloud, ideally you will develop using the cloud based database systems such as SimpleDB, DynamoDB or Amazon RDS. Not every organisation can do this and many of us need to sell our systems into existing organisations such that don’t have these databases and many I have come across will state things like “We only support Microsoft SQL Server or Oracle”. A new instance for each client may actually be cost prohibitive and one of the EC2 instances may actually run 5 or maybe even 20 copies of your applications for your client. In this way the fewer EC2 instances you need the lower your costs of deployment.

We all don’t live in the USA

I like the USA, and love New York but there are things about USA based companies that don’t understand the needs of overseas companies. Unless you have a USA bank account you cannot use services such as DevPay which would make it easy to allocate services on an as needed basis. 

Living in Australia, I cannot use DevPay but would like to. Instead I need to do somethings manually to setup services which is not as nice as I would like. 

So whats the solution

What I am proposing is a system to automate the allocation of Web based services  based on a customer signup. So a customer can sign up to a service and:
Select what kind of service that they want to run which could correlate to an instance size.
We collect the payment details
We collect the other details and setup them up on an existing EC2 or create a new EC2 instance.

Then for the application provisioned application we would have something like the following:
The application folder is setup on the destination instance
A database is setup linked to the application such as SQL Server
A subdomain is setup against the application folder
The folder files and database are scheduled to be backed up on a daily basis to S3
The details of the client application are stored so that notifications can be sent through to the applications.
Other custom actions are performed on the application folder for the new client

From a management perspective we may want to manage the apps on our instances as well, pause services off when client do not pay or move clients to larger instance configurations, ensure that the storage of the files doesn’t exceed the amount allocated for the service.

A solution framework for this should allow many Windows web developers using frameworks such as ASP.NET or ISAPI to provision applications and optimally run your cloud based solution. 

How will this be built?

This will be a combination of tools combined from existing open source projects, existing tools and contributions from the community. There are many abstractions that will be used for this tool and my hope is that that others can help develop extensions for this tool. 

Apps to create in the solution


Web App to signup customers and kick off the instance provision process

Amazon DevPay	"Updating product description pages
Hi Devpay folx,

We would like to update several of our product description pages for our Devpay offerings.  We used to have an option to edit these pages which was frozen some months ago.  We where told at the time that there was an update to the CMS system being put in place.  Several of our product descriptions such as:

http://aws.amazon.com/customerapps/3351
http://aws.amazon.com/customerapps/2358

are now out of date and we would like to update them.  Can you please advise on how this may be done.

Thank-you in advance.
-Support"
