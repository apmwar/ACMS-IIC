AWS Cloud9	"Cloud9 development / product roadmap
I have adopted Cloud9 as my IDE to support my serverless development workflow.

Another important tool in this workflow is aws-sam-cli.

The aws sam cli docs use visual studio code to demonstrate local debugging of lambda and api gateway and not cloud9 which i find disappointing. I have tried to replicate the model in Cloud9 unsuccessfully, leading me to wonder is the Cloud9 sam integration still stuck at node 0.2.11? Indeed how can I determine what version the interface is using? how does it related to our pip installed version? Is there a way to upgrade the Cloud9 IDE?

These are questions I am currently struggling to find answers to.

It seems to be at the moment the debugging experience in Cloud9 is falling behind that of aws-sam-cli and my question is, is this something that is on the Cloud9 roadmap and what are the timescales? Is the product getting enough support to keep up with the developments in aws-sam-cli or should I consider bailing over to visual studio code, which aws-sam-cli appears to have better integration with?

Thanks in advance

Richard."
AWS Cloud9	"Re: Cloud9 development / product roadmap
I'm happy to try to follow up with the AWS Cloud9 team for you here. First though, a few questions:

I'm not sure what you mean by your trying to replicate the model in AWS Cloud9 unsuccessfully. What specific steps were you trying to take, what were you expecting to happen, and what happened instead?

What do the following commands return for you from the AWS Cloud9 IDE: 

aws --version
node --version
pip --version
sam --version

(If sam --version returns earlier than 0.3.0, try upgrading your local AWS SAM CLI installation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install-additional.html#serverless-sam-cli-install-additional-cloud9)

Which AWS Lambda runtimes are you targeting for your AWS serverless applications?

You mention that it seems like the debugging experience in AWS Cloud9 is falling behind that of the AWS SAM CLI. Are there any specifics between what you expected and what you're observing that you could share here?

Hi Paul,

Thanks for coming back to me. Here are my installed versions:

aws-cli/1.14.8 Python/2.7.14 Linux/4.14.62-70.117.amzn2.x86_64 botocore/1.12.96
node v8.15.0

SAM CLI, version 0.11.0

which sam: /usr/bin/sam
sam --version: SAM CLI, version 0.11.0

yet, using lambda pane in cloud9 reveals some logs...

Function Logs
A newer version of the AWS SAM CLI is available!
Your version:   0.2.11
Latest version: 0.11.0
See https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sam-local for upgrade instructions

I actually see that the lambda pane supports what I want to achieve (locally debugging of lambdas that are run locally using docker), this actually requires remote debugging feature, and I was trying to configure this using a cloud9 run configuration but found out this was a dead end.

The lambda pane on the right does seem to be a bit flakey which is why I have avoided it and tried to follow the aws-sam-cli guides, but yes, I can see it is somehow stuck at 0.2.11, while on the command line I have 0.11.0.

Thanks

Richard,"
AWS Cloud9	"Re: Cloud9 development / product roadmap
To follow up on this, if for example, you use webpack to package your lambda code, the Cloud9 Lambda GUI is not be able to understand your project, however if you had the ability to configure the cloud9 debugger and set local path, remote path (like the visual studio code example given by the sam team), this is possible.

Cloud9 sam gui must be doing something like this under the hood, exposing the configuration to the end user would be great and might enable us to achieve this."
AWS Cloud9	"Re: Cloud9 development / product roadmap
Just curious, did you try upgrading your local AWS SAM CLI installation; and if so, did it address any of your concerns? 

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install-additional.html#serverless-sam-cli-install-additional-cloud9

Paul
AWS Cloud9 Documentation"
AWS Cloud9	"Re: Cloud9 development / product roadmap
That was helpful nugget of info, (the link command to get the newer sam into Cloud9)

See this page: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-using-debugging-additional-arguments.html

It shows how you can pass debugger args into sam invoke, in particular set the remote and client directories. Well pretty sure remote will always be /var/task, but if we could set client working directory then would be enabled us to debug and step through the source when we create our own more complex builds / zips.

Another issue with webpack builds is that the lambda gui pane does not recognise them I suspect because the exports.handler is wrapped in the self invoking webpack boostrapper. Do you know if this is something that is being looked into?

To be fair, fixing point 2 would probably negate point 1.

Thanks.

If you want to set/use environment variables with the AWS SAM CLI, or if you want to pass parameters to the AWS SAM CLI, you'll need to do that by running those commands directly, for example from the terminal in the AWS Cloud9 IDE. 

Not sure if this addresses your specific webpack issue or not, but does the following information help at all?

Hi Paul,

Thanks for your reply.

I can fire up sam local invoke from the command line and expose a debug port and pass various environment variables but there is no way then to attach the cloud9 debugger to that port. I have tried creating a custom runner (but it doesn't work and lacks support for local and remote paths)

The integrated lambda / sam in cloud9 doesn't currently seem to support es6 / webpack built lambdas, they run, but if you turn on debugger it hangs. Being able to debug against source files and not the webpack bundle would be ACE. Can we get any feedback from the dev team if this is on roadmap and how long? As a bounty/motivational incentive, i've tested this in visual studio code using aws-sam-cli and it works!"

I have a js project running on cloud9 for development, which my team developers use in India. But the preview url rending is extremely slow, on the other hand, it runs very fast in US. So it could be speed issues related to AWS CDN available in India. I have used the same cloud9 space in Delhi, Mumbai, HP, they were very slow, took few mins to load, on other hand in US, i can open the preview url instantly for same cloud9 space with same specs.

I'm happy to try following up with the AWS Cloud9 team about this. First though, a few questions: 

Which AWS Region is your AWS Cloud9 development environment running in? 

Just so I understand, you're trying to access that exact same environment from different locations in both the US and India, correct? 

Do either your US or India locations have any VPCs, VPNs, firewalls, or similar that might possibly be contributing to network delays?

Do you experience the same sorts of delays when making other calls to other AWS services? Or does it seem to happen only when making programmatic calls to AWS Cloud9?

Paul
AWS Cloud9 Documentation"
AWS Cloud9	"Re: Cloud9 Preview url slow rendering
Thanks Paul. Region is Mumbai data center, i changed it to Chicago data center as well just to try but not much difference, so I reverted it back to Mumbai. In India I used various internet connection types wired adsl, fibre, 4G LTE which were being hosted by different routers/modems and different ISPs, I don't think there is any firewall.

We have several cloud9 node based environments being used for JS projects, so everything opens fine otherwise in India, opening of the IDE UI etc. Just the preview url after compiling the project, takes very long to open in the browser. In US, I can open the same preview url of the same IDE environment, at the same time, super fast. 

We do not use any other AWS service as of now, so can't compare, but as I mentioned, we can login to AWS console, open cloud9 IDEs etc all fine. Just the preview url takes few mins, sometimes more than that to open or even do not open at all. Our developers are in Delhi, HP, Mumbai, Chhattisgarh, all diff states and places in India, the problem is same everywhere. Also, the issue is not for one particular project IDE, we have several Cloud9 instances with projects of diff sizes etc, preview url issue is same.

I think this issue is specific to the preview url, which actually is a unique url provided per IDE for rendering your work in the browser. This needs some optimization, and i am sure it can open as fast as the could9 IDE or AWS console it self, which again works fine in India.

It would be really very helpful if AWS can resolve this for us, since this online IDE saves a ton of effort for collaborating on code with others."
AWS Cloud9	"Re: Cloud9 Preview url slow rendering
By AWS Region, I mean one of the regions that AWS Cloud9 supports, for example: 

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html?id=docs_gateway#cloud9_region

Which AWS Region are your AWS Cloud9 development environments in, for example, US West (Oregon)? 

The reason I ask is that, for example, if your environments are in US West (Oregon), and you're trying to access them from India, I would expect some sort of delay. Certainly not huge delays like the ones you're describing, but this information could help the AWS Cloud9 team begin to troubleshoot nonetheless. 

Also, what are the canonical formats of the URLs that you're trying preview? For example, for URLs that look like https://12a34567b8cd9012345ef67abcd890e1.vfs.cloud9.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/, we only support previewing those URLs when the person who is trying to preview that URL has the AWS Cloud9 IDE for the related environment open and that application is running in the same web browser.

Hi, I have configured the environment for Cloud9 on the existing Ubuntu 18.04 Lightsail instance according to the instructions on this page https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/lightsail-instances.html .

I have completed all of the steps, including running the AWS Cloud9 Installer and almost everything works great, but I do not get any Python autocompletion hints nor information in the IDE when there are errors in the code.

AWS Cloud9	"Re: Missing Python code hints on Lightsail c9 deployment
I'm happy to try following up with the AWS Cloud9 team here for you. First though, a few questions:

Which version of Python are you using (run the python --version in the terminal from the AWS Cloud9 IDE)?

What does the echo $PYTHONPATH command return in that same terminal?

Does the following command from that same terminal return the same result as the previous one: 

python -c ""import os;print os.environ['PYTHONPATH']""


If that echo command returns nothing and that python -c command returns an error, then it looks like PYTHONPATH might not be set properly. You could set this manually by running the command export PYTHONPATH=<Current Preferences value for PYTHONPATH>, where <Current Preferences for PYTHONPATH> is whatever is in your Preferences page for PYTHONPATH, for example:

export PYTHONPATH=""/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages:/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages:/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages""
 

Note that export would work only for the current session; to persist this you could add it to your ~/.bashrc file or similar. If you try that and it still doesn't work, let me know what happened.

AWS Cloud9	"AWS CLI is not installed - when uploading Lambda
Hi,

I installed cloud9 through ssh on my own remote machine (ubuntu 18.4). The IDE works great and everything seems to work, with the exception of pushing lambda to the cloud.

If I follow the tutorial (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/tutorial-lambda.html) I get error AWS CLI is not installed, when I try to upload the function.

AWS Cloud9	"Re: AWS CLI is not installed - when uploading Lambda
My immediate impressions here are one or more of the following: 

1. Have you completed all of the prerequisite setup instructions in https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/lambda-functions.html#lambda-functions-prepare
2. There's a chance that the AWS CLI on your own remote machine might be configured with AWS credentials that allow AWS STS GetCallerIdentity but not AWS IAM GetUser. To diagnose, you could try running some other IAM commands such as aws iam get-role to see if you can call other IAM commands. If the problem still occurs, you could run aws configure to see what AWS credentials are being used and then open your ~/.aws/credentials and/or ~/.aws/config to visually match them up. From there, you could open your IAM console and see which AWS permissions are associated with those AWS credentials.  
3. Probably unlikely, but the AWS CLI install on your own remote machine might be partially corrupted. You could try re-installing the AWS CLI. For details, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-linux.html
4. The AWS Cloud9 Installer might not have fully run correctly on your own remote machine. You could try re-running the AWS Cloud9 Installer. For details, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/installer.html#installer-download-run

AWS Cloud9	"Problems with TypeScript opened in the Cloud9 editor
Hello AWS team,
I am having a problem with my TypeScript projects.  Essentially, the linting and compiler error messages are not updating properly.

For example, if I had a simple function like this:

function foo(bar: string, baz: string) {
  console.log(bar)
}


I get a nice little i next to first line helpfully letting me know that ""baz is declared but its value is never read"".

The problem is that if I edit the function to remove the baz parameter, the i notification remains.  I observe this behavior with any type of feedback from the TypeScript support system.

A quirk that seems to be related is that, sometimes, as I am typing a line like ""console.log(b)"", the editor will notify me of a problem like ""Cannot find name 'b'"".  It continues to display this message even after I finish typing ""console.log(bar)"".

I also see directories flagged as having errors despite no files in the directory containing errors or even being flagged as such.

Sometimes these erroneous messages go away on their own, but usually they hang around forever.  The only way I can get rid of them is by right-clicking on a type name or function name.  I think the ""Jump to defintition"" feature on the right-click menu triggers an update of some kind - but this doesn't always immediately work.

I tried that.
When you do it you get the following error:
Forbidden You don't have permission to access (+whatever directory you said+) on this server."
AWS Cloud9	"Re: AWS Cloud9 running Apache
For diagnostics, you could allow permissions for all with a command such as the following:

sudo chmod -R u=rwx,g=rwx,o=rwx /PATH/TO/FOLDER


Then try what you were doing again. Later, you should set ownership with:

sudo chown -R USERNAME:GROUP /PATH/TO/FOLDER


Where /PATH/TO/FOLDER is the target directory, USERNAME is the output of running the whoami command, and GROUP is one of the groups output when running the groups $(whoami) command--I think it's something like www-data for Apache.

AWS Cloud9	"Cloud9 Serverless deployment issue with Roles

That's my understanding as well. If the serverless application requires parameters to be specified during deployment, you can deploy it from the IDE only by using the terminal. If there are any parameters, deploy the serverless application from the terminal in the IDE by running the AWS CloudFormation deploy command.

AWS Cloud9	"Re: Cloud9 lambda wizard renames lambda application name to function name.
Not sure if this helps, but AWS Cloud9 gives remote resources different names than their local equivalents. For example, if you name a serverless application myDemoServerlessApplication and the function myDemoFunction, the remote version name of your function would be cloud9-myDemoServerlessApplication-myDemoFunction-RANDOM_ID, where RANDOM_ID is a randomly determined ID.

AWS Cloud9	"Unable to reconnect to Cloud9
Hi,
I have been using Cloud9 to develop node.js servers hosted on AWS EC2 instances. However, lately when I take a break from coding and come back a little later, the browser refuses to reconnect to Cloud9. It just shows the “Connecting...” message without ever reconnecting. So far, I have been able to reconnect by shutting down the Cloud9 instance and starting it again. But now, that doesn't work either. Today I have restarted the Cloud9 instance several times, and it still refuses to connect.
I have tried another browser, to test whether it was browser/cookie related, but the other browser (MS Edge) also refused to connect and just showed the “Connecting...” message.

AWS Cloud9	"Re: Unable to reconnect to Cloud9
Is your Amazon EC2 instance one that was created from within AWS Cloud9 (in other words, did you create an AWS Cloud9 EC2 environment)? Or is this an Amazon EC2 instance as part of an AWS Cloud9 SSH environment? Also, I wonder, does creating a separate AWS Cloud9 development environment work, so that it might be isolated to issues with just that single environment? Finally, have you made any changes to the underlying Amazon VPC, subnet, route table, or security groups?

Paul
AWS Cloud9 Documentation"
AWS Cloud9	"Re: Unable to reconnect to Cloud9
The environment was created from within Cloud9. Yes, creating a new environment works. The issue is related to the one environment. No, I have not made any changes to VPC, subnet, route table, or security groups.
I have tried to debug the issue by logging into the Cloud9 instance through SSH (by making an AMI from the bugged Cloud9 instance and launching it in a new EC2 instance with a key pair). It would then refuse to log me in, stating that it was shutting down in 1 minute. I assume this is the auto-hibernation mode that is making it shut down and give this response. However it is a bug, as it never shuts down, and just refuses any connections, including that from the Cloud9 browser.

I finally managed to remove the bug by starting the bugged instance and then allowing the auto-hibernation mode to shut it down. That cleared the “I'm shutting down in 1 minute”-bug, and allowed me to log in again. So now, I have shut the auto-hibernation mode off to avoid repeating the bug. However, if I take a break from my Cloud9 browser and come back to continue work a little later, the browser still refuses to connect again unless I stop and restart the Cloud9 instance. This appears to be a different bug, as it can be solved by simply stopping and restarting the instance. My work routine now is to always shut down the Cloud9 instance before taking a break, and then relaunching then Cloud9 environment when I resume work. This always works, even if it takes a little longer time."

Problem 1: Major

So this only started happening recently.

When I switch tabs between open files, the location of where I left those tabs keeps changing randomly. I keep having to search where the heck I was on the previous file and it is really effecting my productivity. The files never stay where they are supposed to be. I have even tried clearing all of my cache in chrome, logging out and in, restarting, logging out of my chrome user, etc. Running it in App mode on Chrome, running it in a tab, same thing. Is there a reason why this is happening?

Problem 2: Wonkiness with global search.

Is there any way, when hitting ctrl + P and doing a search, and then hitting CTRL + P again, that it can clear the search value? It used to do this...
Is it also possible for it not to try to open the first file as I search? Something similar to the Enable Preview on Tree Selection I thought there was a setting for this before? This causes undo processing and visually with so many files causes me to open the wrong one sometimes.

Is there any way, when hitting ctrl + P and doing a search, and then hitting CTRL + P again, that it can clear the search value? It used to do this...

If you have something typed in Go to Anything panel and then clicked Ctrl + P again it should select all your input in that field and if you type something new it should override existing data fully. Does it work like this for you?

Is it also possible for it not to try to open the first file as I search? Something similar to the Enable Preview on Tree Selection I thought there was a setting for this before? This causes undo processing and visually with so many files causes me to open the wrong one sometimes.

Under Preferences -> User Preferences -> Tree and Go Panel there is still option called `Enable Preview on Tree Selection`. I just verified myself that if it's disabled it does not open file when you type or navigate through panel.

There is also option `Open Files when Navigating Results with ↓ ↑` which is used for Find in Files functionality (the one which has Ctrl + F  shortcut)

AWS Cloud9	"Cloud9 initialization and CloudFormation
Is it possible to apply an init script to a Cloud9 environment when it's created via CloudFormation? For example, I want all my Cloud9 environments to automatically default to Python 3 instead of Python 2, and I might want to pre-install a few additional yum and pip packages.

The AWS::Cloud9::EnvironmentEC2 CloudFormation resource lacks a UserData property, so there doesn't seem to be a way to automate this."
AWS Cloud9	"Re: Cloud9 initialization and CloudFormation
Currently this is not possible. That being said, it's possible to enable this somewhat by storing a shell script in an accessible Git-based repository. Then you could use the Repositories property of the AWS::Cloud9::EnvironmentEC2 resource to specify the URL to the repo that contains that shell script. When the associated AWS Cloud9 EC2 environment launches, it attempts to clone the repo that contains the shell script. Then the user could manually run that cloned shell script.

AWS Cloud9	"Cloud9 ""freezes"" after running lambda function
I'm experiencing an strange behavior. I was debugging a lambda function when I made a change to its YAML file. I think I made a silly mistake on it and when I ran the lambda again, it stayed stuck on the ""Loading..."" step. (the function normally in a few seconds)
I've also noted that the ""file explorer"" is constantly refreshing. 
Print scree attached. 
Any idea what may be causing the problem and how to fix it?

BTW, if closed the function, reverted my changes on the YAML but it didnt fix the problem.
BTW2, it broke all other lambda functions as no other one runs"
AWS Cloud9	"Re: Cloud9 ""freezes"" after running lambda function
My immediate reaction is that there's probably some sort of temporary network connectivity issue at play, hence the ""bubbles."" Have you been able to make those bubbles go away by either refreshing the related web browser tab or closing and then re-opening the related environment? If the bubbles went away, were the files at least in the state they were before those bubbles started?

AWS Cloud9	"Cloud9 preview running app fails on Firefox
Hi,

There was an earlier thread with the same issue I'm having. In that thread, AWS staff suggested it was caused by the puma rubygem. I've confirmed that is not the case.

The issue: previewing app within the IDE or in the same browser fails with ""VFS connection not found"" error. In Chrome, this works. On firefox, it does not. I know a workaround is to just use Chrome, but I would like to understand why it's happening.

Here is the Firefox developer tools debugger output for the error page:

Error loading this URI: Could not load the source for blob:https://********************.vfs.cloud9.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/********.
[Exception... ""Failed to open input source 'blob:https://******.vfs.cloud9.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/***'""  nsresult: ""0x805303f4 (<unknown>)""  location: ""JS frame :: resource://devtools/shared/base-loader.js -> resource://devtools/shared/DevToolsUtils.js :: mainThreadFetch :: line 644""  data: yes]

Line: 644, column: 0


What I've tried: allowing all cookies & trackers, disabling all add-ons, resetting configuration options. 

One thing I found in the MDN documentation is that Firefox and Chrome have much different implementations of the File and Directory Entries API: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_and_Directory_Entries_API -- If others have the same issue using Firefox, that could confirm that it's actually a browser compatibility issue.

Note: Yes, I am aware this can be considered an issue with firefox, but the only product being affected as far as i know is this one. Fully supporting one of the top browsers should be considered worthy of discussion here. AWS should be aware if a feature is currently incompatible with FF. Rest assured I will also inquire at the Mozilla community."

AWS Cloud9	"Debug fails in Multiple Lambda Functions Config in SAM
Hi there,

I'm using SAM development under Cloud9,
I have config multiple lambda python in my Application, but I have some questions I can't figure it out how to solve it.

If I add lambdas to my app, It appends a config section to Template yaml File under Resources tag, and it adds the handler like this Handler: function01/lambda_function.lambda_handler and the CodeUri:  CodeUri: .debug/
Suppose I have 5 lambdas config in same template, when I deploy the lambdas, it saves all de packages used plus all the files to a .debug folder, then all lambdas are packaged and deployed each time for every lambda, so every lambda has all packages and all lambdas. It was working Ok until the package file was increased so I can't deploy lambdas anymore. How can I deploy only each lambda part for each function?

I was following this post ""Multiple Lambdas in SAM application and size of each function"", https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=825237&#825237 and this one about naming differente codeuri folder per lambda
https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=824354&#824354

It says they solve the problem changing de CodeUri tag to point each lambda function to a separate CodeUri, replacing  .debug/ with  ./function0x, then I need to install each used package in that folder plus ikp3db debug package in each lambda folder, I would prefer it does it automatically like it does with .debug folder.

Then lambdas runs ok and I can deploy them, but now I can't debug, it shows this error message:
IKPdb error: Failed to set a breakpoint at AppName/MyFunctionName/lambda_function.py:44 (Line /var/runtime/awslambda/MyFunctionName/lambda_function.py:44 does not exist.).

It 's like debug only works if I use the standar CodeUri .debug/ folder.

Does exist some documentation/tutorial about Best Practices with SAM development in Cloud9 with multiple lambda functions?

Thanks"
AWS Cloud9	"Re: Debug fails in Multiple Lambda Functions Config in SAM
Hi,
I have faced the same issue and found a workaround.
1. rename the template.yml file on the project to template.yml.old (temporally for debugging time)
2. create a new template.yml on the lambda code directory with a default values, and change the handler to point the correct file.handler:

AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Transform: 'AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31'
Resources:
  myfunction:
    Type: 'AWS::Serverless::Function'

      Runtime: python2.7
      Description: ''
      MemorySize: 128
      Timeout: 15
      CodeUri: .

3. install the IKPdb on the lambda directory
4. close all the run windows, and run again with debug mode
5. when you have done, rename the template.yml.old back to template.yml (no need to delete the one you have created on the lambda directory)

AWS Cloud9	"How to pass a template parameter in cloud9 interface to Deploy
Hi all,

I want to setup a development environment where i can debug ( with breakpoints, watch, ... ) all my lambda functions WITH aws resources ( mainly dynamodb tables but also sns, sqs, ... )

For this to work, i need an easy way to instantiate aws resources and to inject them in the lambda.
Environment variables of the lambdas seems to be the right place to do that.

Moreover what i did in the past was to put all ""permanent"" resources in a separate cloudformation template 
( the resources_template )  which takes a deployment_id as parameter and  
export all the resources using the deployment_id as a prefix as explained here https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-stack-exports.html

For example,If deploymentID is ""joe"",  Dynamodb Table  Resource name with logical ID ""UsersTable""  and which might be have a PhysicalID  like mystack-UsersTable-646z46e456z44e6 is exported as Joe:UsersDynamoDbTable => joe_stack-UsersTable-646z46e456z44e6

The plan is to use SAM template to import those exported resources in the environmnent variables of the lambda functions with something like

Parameters: 
  DeploymentId: 
    Type: String
    Default: bar
    Description: deployment id

Resources:		
  foo:
    Type: 'AWS::Serverless::Function'
    Properties:
      Handler: foo/index.handler
      Runtime: nodejs6.10
      Description: ''
      Environment :
        Variables :
          USER_TABLE :
            Fn::ImportValue:
               Fn::Join: [ "":"", 

and finally get them in node with process.env.USER_TABLE

so we finally got process.env.USER_TABLE => joe_stack-UsersTable-646z46e456z44e6

If i set a default value for the DeploymentId parameter it works like a charm but if i want every member of the team to use a different set of resources so  i have to set  a different parameter value for everyone ( joe, bill, jack, prod, uat, staging, ... ) 

I searched for a while but could not figure out how to do that in the UI although it shouldn't be an issue as the command line interface of aws cloudformation supports it.

Any help would be appreciated.

AWS Cloud9	"Re: How to pass a template parameter in cloud9 interface to Deploy
Hi Paul,

First thank you for taking the time to answer my question.

You pinpoint exactly my issue.

if i take code build for example, i can describe all the steps 
that are executed when i run one build step in buildspec.yml

for example as explain in the doc for 
""building a pipeline fro your serverless application'"" ( lambda doc page 103 pdf ) 

...

page 106

""Add a buildspec.yml ﬁle. A build spec is a collection of build commands and 
related settings, in YAML format, that AWS CodeBuild uses to run a build. 
For more information, see Build Speciﬁcation Reference for AWS CodeBuild.
 In this example, the build action is the following: ""

 And the command run is 


 aws cloudformation package 
 --template template.yml 
 --s3-bucket $S3_BUCKET 
 --output-template template-export.yml
-parameters { deployment_name : $DEPLOYMENT_NAME }

so i can use environment variables to pass parameters to the template ( $DEPLAYMENT_NAME ) and i can set the environment variables in the code build UI  like here :  https://drive.google.com/file/d/18jN-Pnu6r5eFpyuSuydy3qUR3PWyK9sT/view?usp=sharing . 


But for cloud9, when i click ""Deploy"" it is a complete black box 
( or i didn't find or figure out what is happening )
What is executed behind the curtain ? Same stuff as in code build based on buildspec.yml
Or custom stuffs ?

if it is the same, what is triggered on the cmd line ?  
how can i set the environment variables  like in code build ?
In a UI  ? or i need to run a script setting my env variable ?
If so, How can i tweak what is triggered when i click ""deploy"" ? 

If it is something different, how can i get access to what is triggered ?
to push some parameters, to change the default name of the template
template.yml => my_favorite_template.json 
( because i want to use json for example )

Tried to search for command line style info in applications.json or anywhere in c9 folders but
 I couldn't figure out.

Hope it is a bit more clear.

Thank you for your help,

AWS Cloud9	"Re: How to pass a template parameter in cloud9 interface to Deploy
When you choose the Deploy button in the Lambda  section of the AWS Resources window, AWS Cloud9 looks for a template.yaml file in the AWS Lambda function's corresponding serverless application for instructions about how to deploy. This template.yaml file uses the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) format, which includes things like Lambda function settings and, in your specific use case, the inclusion of environment variables. You can edit the template.yaml file directly inside the AWS Cloud9 IDE to change these settings, define environment variables, and the like.

For more information, see ""AWS SAM Template Basics"" at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-template-basics.html and the AWS SAM specification at https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/versions/2016-10-31.md.

Thank you for your answer.
Please take a look at the screenshot of the template.yml here : https://drive.google.com/file/d/14BcWMTUrL7uXkv_RWxBlFdgtnbpw-wKt/view?usp=sharing

I understand how to setup environment variables on the lambdas ( the green stuff ). Globals would only change that not setting the env var on every lambdas but globally if i am correct.

What i am trying to achieve is to setup the deployment_id parameter. ( blue arrow ).
A solution would be to  change the default value in the template.
This would work but as soon as a team of 2 persons are working together they need to change the template.yml to setup their own default value and not forget to avoid commiting it.

write a sed script to convert  a template.yml.tpl file to template.yml and replace

AWS Cloud9	"Re: How to pass a template parameter in cloud9 interface to Deploy
OK, I think I now get what you're looking for. If I understand correctly, you want a way to get parameter values from the person who is deploying the AWS Lambda function at the time they're deploying it, and not from parameter values already hard-coded into the AWS SAM template.  

Currently, the Lambda section of the AWS Resources window in the AWS Cloud9 IDE doesn't support a graphical experience for this (similar to the AWS CloudFormation console experience). However, you can use a terminal session in the AWS Cloud9 IDE to run the AWS CLI aws cloudformation deploy command along with the --parameter-overrides option to specify dynamic parameter values at the time of deployment. 

For more information, see the ""Using Intrinsic Functions"" example at https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/HOWTO.md, the aws cloudformation deploy reference at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/deploy/index.html, and additional available deployment options at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/lambda-functions.html#lambda-function-upload-code-specify.

Yes, you can use Ubuntu when creating an AWS Cloud9 development environment. Follow the instructions at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/create-environment.html#create-environment-ssh

These instructions assume that you already have an existing Ubuntu Server EC2 instance or your own server running Ubuntu Server.

AWS Cloud9	"Lambda on cloud9 and code commit
How do you suggest to use cloud9 with code-commit. lets say I create a lambda function using the ""create new lambda function"" button on the ""aws resources"" tab. The function is created on the /environment/myfunction folder.

Thats not ideal If the lambda is part of a code commit repo.

If I cut the ""myfunction"" folder and place it inside my code's folder (like /environment/myrepofolder/myfunction), it fails on deployment (yeah there are ways to fix it, but it requires manual intervention to update the links, which tells me the cloud9 team was not intending that to be done)

What do you have to say on this scenario?
Thanks"
AWS Cloud9	"Re: Lambda on cloud9 and code commit
I just spoke with someone on the AWS Cloud9 team about this. 

If you want to source control your AWS Lambda functions' code, then AWS CodeCommit is a reasonable option for doing so. (Other options include Lambda function versioning and aliases depending on your needs; for more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/versioning-aliases.html) 

If you do use a source code repository such as AWS CodeCommit, be sure to check in all of the files that the wizard generates, except perhaps for the .application.json file (or add the file to your .gitignore file). This is especially true if you plan to share your source code with developers outside of your AWS account, because it can have AWS account-specific information baked into it. 

Hope this helps.

AWS Cloud9	"accessing rest urls from cloud9 debug/test urls  - Now with a limerick
I guess that the staff at aws are too polite to be plainspeaking so i will do it for them.

Cloud9 appears to be deliberately restricted so that one may test applications  that  serve static content such as images and html pages only.  If you want to test full stack single page applications  with REST calls to support  user interaction good luck with that.  Apparently  one needs to set up the appropriate security configuration for them. So instead of fulfilling the promise of a  of a cheap and cheerful, high quality UI which seduces new users into committing to the AWS platform you have to go to  after school ""security""   detention first.

What a shame.  Now i have to spend the effort to master the rest of the security model before I can get any value out of using the very cool IDE.   So rather than  a rant... a poem (barely) 

There once was cloud named 9
Which had the potential to shine
Yet it was restricted
So now I'm conflicted
Is it really worth the time?


I am copying some of the content from a previous post into this as background for whomever at aws picks this item up.

I can run my app in the debugger but cannot send REST requests from the front end webpage back to the app to process... 

I have tried the suggestion below and no luck.

If someone could either tell me that REST calls from the ide are not possible or that i have to set up an APIGateway  to do this I would appreciate it.

I would (obviously) prefer not to go through  the chore of setting up an entire new interface for 6 REST calls but either way  an clear and unambiguous answer would no doubt help me and others trying to use cloud9.

Thanks
 ============

Right now i can access the landing page at https://9f1bf47699b742bcbb1da56a90efb989.vfs.cloud9.us-west-2.amazonaws.com

but that page make rest calls to my server where i then access an rdb mysql instance. To do this I make fetch requests for posts and gets with urls like 
https://9f1bf47699b742bcbb1da56a90efb989.vfs.cloud9.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/transactions 

these requests (anything with the basePath plus /xxxxx do not reach the server. ( i have set breakpoints in the server instance that are never accessed)


I'm curious: how are you trying to access your landing page? Is it through the corresponding development environment's IDE, or through a separate web browser tab, web browser, or web app altogether? 

We don't recommend you use the ""vfs.cloud9"" URL from anywhere other than the corresponding development environment's IDE. That URL works only when the IDE for that environment is open and the application is running in the same web browser. You might want to try using the backing instance's IP address instead. There are a few ways to get this address. One quick way is to run this command from inside the corresponding development environment's IDE: 

curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4


I just tried it and it is the same as the other way in other words I can go to the main landing page 

35.163.210.228:8080 
but not any other rest url like: 

35.163.210.228:8080/accounts

AWS Cloud9	"Re: accessing rest urls from cloud9 debug/test urls  - Now with a limerick
The details you requested are at the end of this email but i have to comment on how unfortunately second rate this entire system is... and unnecessarily so. I look at the traffic on your forums and it is anemic for a company the size of amazon. My guess is that potential customers  just get fed  up and implement other solutions.  I would wager that your follow trial to customer close  rate from your website is less than 1% (on web only aws purchases) 

AWS services  remind me of the razor commercial where all the razors are locked up so no one will buy them.

Humorously I am running the application successfully right now from my own home server. It accesses aws for RDS and cognito and uses codestar for the git interface but i have been unsuccessful with ec2 elastic beanstock and cloud9 to simply instantiate an instance that  can be accessed from a browser anywhere.

The good news is that cloud9 is not the only offender.  But that is like re-arranging deck chairs... '

Truly and without exaggeration this might be the worst user experience i have ever had using any system of any kind including early versions of windows . I am beginning to believe that AWS   in truth really stands for for Atrocious Web Software (similar  to the now defunct SABENA airlines which was thought to be an abbreviation for  (Such A Bad Experience Never Again)...  

Do yourself a favor and read through the instructions to set up an ec2 instance.  I dare you to be able to sense out of it. There are so many internal references to internal security and setting requirements that it might as well be in klingon... None of this is complicated stuff.. But it is made complicated by second rate work and third rate supervision of that work.  

My full stack app is not that complex  I have a node .js server instance that makes calls to cognito, rds and several other public apis ( Plaid, stripe, and a few others).  In addition the server handles  REST calls from the client (right now just chrome browsers)   all  are working properly as long as they are not running on a AWS instance.

My client app is a react based (webpacked)  website that is served by my server.  I can run the server using koa or express, but this particular instance is only using express.

I make calls the the server as the non localhost equivalent of :
 localhost:3008/transactions    (POST)

localhost:3008/account/:id/one (GET

localhost:3008/account/:id/delete (PUT)

localhost:3008/bank/?userid=xxx (GET, or POST) 

As i said before the cloud9 instance instantiates my code but the app.get(function... etc) calls are never accessed.

If you tell me how i will let you into the instance or my security credentials.

AWS Cloud9	"Typescript support ignores local tsconfig.json. How can I fix this?
Some days ago, my AWS C9 workspace showed a message to install/update typescript language support. I thought this was a great idea, but now I get compilation errors highlighted in the IDE, that don't happen on real compilation.

For example, if I do something like this in a component:

  public myMethod(): Promise<boolean> {
    return Promise.reject('error');
  }


I see an error:

'Promise' only refers to a type, but is being used as a value here. Do you need to change your target library? Try chaning the 'lib' compiler option to es2015 or later.


My tsconfig has es2015 set in lib.

The same goes for experimentalDecorators, what is set in the tsconfig but not recognized by cloud9, as you can see in the attached screenshot.

My question is, where can I adjust what typescript config cloud9 IDE should use for a project?
It would be great, if the IDE would use the tsconfig.json that can be found in the nearest parent folder. In my project, I have two different configs. One for the main project, one for my firebase functions.

Thanks!"
AWS Cloud9	"Re: Typescript support ignores local tsconfig.json. How can I fix this?
Thanks for this quick reply. I hope, we get this error fixed quickly. It keeps me from working efficiently, because all the errors are confusing.

My project uses:


Angular 6
Ionic 3
Typescript 2.7
Firebase


This is my folder structure. I use firebase functions that are build server side and might have their own typescript version.

/home/ec2-user/environment/ 
+-- .c9/ 
+-- .firebase/ 
+-- .git/ 
+-- functions/               # firebase functions directory
|   +-- node_modules/        # firebase functions node modules
|   +-- src/                 # firebase functions source
|   +-- ...                  # more files and directories
|   +-- tsconfig.json        # firebase functions tsconfig
|   +-- tslint.json
|   +-- package.json         # loads desired typescript version for firebase functions. maybe another version as the app.
+-- node_modules/            # app node modules
+-- src/                     # app source
+-- ...                      # more files and directories
+-- tsconfig.json            # app tsconfig
+-- tslint.json
+-- package.json             # loads desired typescript version for the app. maybe another version as firbase functions.


But my problem is not in firebase functions code. It's in the main app code and reappears when I close and open the files. Even a reboot of the environment does not really help.

I read the AWS language support documentation again and realized, I had no global installation of typescript. So I installed typescript globally (in the version my app uses). This somehow helped for some errors and the tsconfig got interpreted for a while. After I logged into the environment today morning, the errors were back and the tsconfig gets ignored again, no matter what values I set.

I had a similar situation a few days ago, when I tried to replace the file /home/ec2-user/environment/.c9/metadata/environment/tsconfig.json with my tsconfig.json. First it seem to work dut after my next login to the enironment (after auto-reboot the next day) this trick did not work any more.

Looks like a ""heisen-bug""

Ok, I just closed all of the open editors and refreshed the IDE to get a clean console output.

But now there are other strange errors, that happen when I have files open while refreshing the IDE. For some imports in my code I now get the error:

File .... is not a module.


But this error only occurs sometimes and seems to have something to do with the configuration of files loaded at refresh and their order!. It seems kind of random, what imports are not working correctly.

In one ""simple"" case I have a file defining a bunch of interfaces that I use as models. This is my first open tab. The second tab is an angular service, that imports 5 models. When I refresh the browser, the references in the service are marked as an error. When I switch to the first tab and back to the second, the errors are gone. In other cases, the errors don't go away, when I switch to the defining file or open it.

I appended a screenshot of my console (I removed some IDs where I did not know if it is somehow security critical info for my workspace). In this case I had two files open. First tab is auth.service.ts, second tab db.service.ts, while the second tab was active on refresh. The db.service.ts imports the auth.service but this import fails in this case. 

Hope this helps. The errors keep changing..."

AWS Cloud9	"Re: Typescript support ignores local tsconfig.json. How can I fix this?
Hello,
I'm also getting Typescript-related error messages in the IDE.  I have an Angular project and any anywhere a decorator is used,

@Component({
  key: ""value""
})
export class SomeComponent {


I get one of the little red ""x"" marks on the line where the class is defined.  When hovered over it reads, ""Experimental support for decorators is a feature that is subject to change in a future release. Set the 'experimentalDecorators' option to remove this warning.""

I can't find anywhere in Cloud9 Preferences that have this 'experimentalDecorators' option.  Indeed, my Angular project folder has a tsconfig.json file (at its root) with

{
  ...,
  ""compilerOptions"": {
    ...,
    ""emitDecoratorMetadata"": true,
    ""experimentalDecorators"": true,
    ...,
  }
}


When I close all files and open just a Typescript file with this error, my console shows the following:

environment-default.js:15573 [ Mon, 19 Nov 2018 19:02:12 GMT INFO collab ] Join /angular-project/src/app/some.component.ts
environment-default.js:15573 [ Mon, 19 Nov 2018 19:02:12 GMT INFO collab ] Joined /angular-project/src/app/some.component.ts

environment-default.js:49084 INFO LSP change collector started observing project
environment-default.js:49084 INFO Created project for root '/angular-project/src/app/some'


Looking through .c9/ and its subdirectories, I don't see any file that would indicate settings the editor's Typescript behavior.

Any advice?"
AWS Cloud9	"Re: Typescript support ignores local tsconfig.json. How can I fix this?
Hi shazbot,

The console line ""Initializing LSP server for '/angular-project/src/app/some'"" indicates that the TypeScript support is using the tsconfig.json inside that directory, so that one should either directly contain
""compilerOptions"": {
  ""experimentalDecorators"": true,
}

or it should inherit it from another tsconfig.json.

You mention that there is a tsconfig.json at the 'root' of your Angular project that contains the right settings. Which directly do you consider the root? Is it different from '/angular-project/src/app/some' ?

To summarize: please make sure the tsconfig.json at  '/angular-project/src/app/some' contains ""experimentalDecorators"": true
 

Hope this helps,

Regards,
Remy

AWS Cloud9	"Re: Typescript support ignores local tsconfig.json. How can I fix this?
Hi Remy,
Thanks for the reply.  My Angular project's root is just /angular-project/ - this is the directory where the tsconfig.json file resides.

There is a file in /angular-project/src named ""tsconfig.app.json"", which has a line:
{
  ""extends"": ""../tsconfig.json"",
  ...
}

But there is no tsconfig file in /angular-project/src/app/some

Where I wrote:
environment-default.js:49084 INFO Created project for root '/angular-project/src/app/some'

It was supposed to be:
environment-default.js:49084 INFO Created project for root '/angular-project/src/app'


Are you suggesting I put a tsconfig.json file in that (*/angular-project/src/app*) folder with the experimental decorators option?

Thanks,
shazbot"
AWS Cloud9	"Re: Typescript support ignores local tsconfig.json. How can I fix this?
TypeScript support will use the tsconfig.json file that is closest to the .ts file that you're using. If your console is showing 
environment-default.js:49084 INFO Created project for root '/angular-project/src/app'

then apparently there is a tsconfig.json file in 
/angular-project/src/app

Make sure that tsconfig.json file has the option
""experimentalDecorators"": true,

either directly or through extending a tsconfig.json file that has it."
AWS Cloud9	"Re: Typescript support ignores local tsconfig.json. How can I fix this?
Hi Remy,
There is absolutely no tsconfig.json file in that directory ( /angular-project/src/app ); however, if I create a file with that name and put in the ""experimentalDecorators"": true option, then the error messages I was seeing go away.

So something is not quite working right.

You're correct. After looking into this more closely we've found that the issue you're experiencing is caused by a bug in our code. We're working on resolving it now. I'd like to thank you for reporting this

AWS Cloud9	"""Find In Files"" buggy feature
Hello AWS Forums,

When using the ""Find in Files"" feature, I find that on most occasions the query stalls or returns nothing even though I can verify, using the ""Find in File"" feature, that the lookup keyword existed in some files. I am not sure if some series of user actions causes this feature to go into this state or if its possible that a query could be too large. Is there a way to hard restart this feature or force-clear the (possible) query that could be going on in the background?

Side Notes:
a) This feature was working fine between 2018-11-26 and 2018-12-03; before then, it was also stalling or returning nothing 
b) My most recent actions that led to this behavior: refresh the page while the ""Find in Files"" search bar and ""/.c9/searchresults"" file are both open
c) The search environment contains more than 150 files (php, js, html, css)
d) Collaborating with 3 other developers as well on the same Cloud9 enviornmnet"
AWS Cloud9	"Re: ""Find In Files"" buggy feature
A few initial troubleshooting questions here: 

1. Which, if any, find options are being selected (*Regular Expressions*, Match Case, Whole Words, etc.)? Does selecting or clearing any of these find options seem to have any effect?
2. Is the Selection scope set to what you expect (*Environment*, Project (excludes .gitignore'd), Favorites, Open Files, etc.)? Does changing the scope seem to have any effect?
3. If Selection is set to Project (excludes .gitignore'd), are there any .gitignore files in scope that could be affecting the search?
4. Are there any patterns specified in the box to the right of the Find button? Does adding or clearing any patterns seem to have any effect?
