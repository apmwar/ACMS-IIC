Amazon Managed Streaming for Kafka (Amazon MSK)	"Timeout creating topic - Step 5 Getting Started Guide
I have not been able to get past step 5 in the getting started guide as am getting a session time out.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/msk/latest/developerguide/create-topic.html

bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper <replaced with zookeeperconnection string> --replication-factor 3 --partitions 1 --topic AWSKafkaTutorialTopic

https://forums.aws.amazon.com/ WARN Client session timed out, have not heard from server in 10011ms for sessionid 0x0 (org.apache.zookeeper.ClientCnxn)

Any suggestions on how to increase timeout or how to troubleshoot.  No issues up to this step."
Amazon Managed Streaming for Kafka (Amazon MSK)	"Re: Timeout creating topic - Step 5 Getting Started Guide
Hello. Could you confirm that your cluster shows up as Active? The session timeout is indicative that something with the VPC setup is not correctly set up. I'd double check that part first and if nothing shows up, we'd be happy to check your configs if you'd like to share them. Thanks."
Amazon Managed Streaming for Kafka (Amazon MSK)	"Re: Timeout creating topic - Step 5 Getting Started Guide
Hello,

Along with the suggestion of checking the state of the cluster (by viewing the cluster in the MSK console or by using the CLI), another thing to check would be the rules on the Security Group applied to the nodes in the cluster. For that, you can try - 

1) Go to the EC2 Console. Under Network & Security, look at Network Interfaces. 
2) Find any of the ENIs attached to your cluster. They have a description such as ""Amazon MSK network interface for cluster <cluster_arn>""
3) When you select one of the ENIs with that description, in the bottom pane you will see the Security Group associated with that ENI. Check it's inbound and outbound rules. At the very minimum, you want to allow traffic from the instance where you are running your kafka create topic scripts. (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/msk/latest/developerguide/create-client-machine.html explains how to setup a more permissive rule). 

Note that we are working on fixing the MSK CLI and Console to make it easier to find out which Security Group to edit to allow traffic. This is applicable to clusters created from the console or from the CLI using a default Security Group."
Amazon Managed Streaming for Kafka (Amazon MSK)	"How can I access my AWS MSK managed kafka queue from my local machine/EC2
I'm setting up a managed kafka queue on AWS MSK. I can't seem to get the security to work when connecting from a local machine and I can't work out if I can use security groups from one region to another.

I've gone through the information on setting up the security groups on the main documentation here https://docs.aws.amazon.com/msk/latest/developerguide/create-vpc.html. I still can't seem to connect to the broker though. I'm currently using kafka scripts from my local machine in the following way:

bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list ""my-broker-ip:9092"" --topic ""some-topic""


but keep getting the result

 [2019-01-28 12:06:13,278] WARN [Producer clientId=console-producer] Connection to node -1 could not be established. Broker may not be available. (org.apache.kafka.clients.NetworkClient)

I've associated my local IP with all the ports on the security group that I set up with my VPC and associated with the kafka queue but it doesn't seem to have helped. I also don't see how I can associate my boxes with the kafka queue as they are in different regions. Is this possible?

Amazon Managed Streaming for Kafka (Amazon MSK)	"Re: How can I access my AWS MSK managed kafka queue from my local machine/EC2
Hello. Is the local client machine set up according to the instructions in https://docs.aws.amazon.com/msk/latest/developerguide/create-client-machine.html. I'm double checking since unless it is part of the right VPC the client will not be able to communicate with the brokers. 

For connecting across regions, there is some documentation here: https://aws.amazon.com/answers/networking/aws-multiple-region-multi-vpc-connectivity/. 

Thank you"
Amazon Managed Streaming for Kafka (Amazon MSK)	"Unable to connect to MSK cluster from EC2 instance
I created an MSK cluster and then spun up an EC2 instance and installed Kafka 1.1.1.  I can access the cluster via the AWS cli to get the bootstrap brokers and Zookeeper connect string, but when I try to list topics from my EC2 instance, I get a timeout.

The EC2 instance is in the same VPC, but I don't see any way to set a specific security group in MSK.  Any idea how to fix this or at least get more debugging information?"
Amazon Managed Streaming for Kafka (Amazon MSK)	"Re: Unable to connect to MSK cluster from EC2 instance
Step 3 in the getting started guide shows one example of specifying the security groups: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/msk/latest/developerguide/create-cluster.html. Could you confirm those steps work for you?
Thank you"
Amazon Managed Streaming for Kafka (Amazon MSK)	"Re: Unable to connect to MSK cluster from EC2 instance
Thanks for the pointer.  I created the cluster from the AWS console.  Is there no way of updating the security group of an existing cluster?  If not, allowing a cluster to be created from the console is worse than useless."
Amazon Managed Streaming for Kafka (Amazon MSK)	"Re: Unable to connect to MSK cluster from EC2 instance
Unfortunately there is no way to update the security group right now but we're working on it for GA. Thank you."
Amazon Managed Streaming for Kafka (Amazon MSK)	"Re: Unable to connect to MSK cluster from EC2 instance
Hello,

You can also try to change the inbound/outbound rules of the Security Group you already have on the cluster - switching to a new SG isn't the only option. You can edit the SG from the EC2 Console, under the Network and Security menu options.

Does anyone know when this will be available?

Amazon Managed Streaming for Kafka (Amazon MSK)	"Re: When is API Doc going to be available? (REST, MsgRetention, Offset, Schema)
Thank you for your note. Could you provide an example on what you mean by REST docs? The MSK APIs create and manage a cluster. Once the cluster is created you can use the tools and APIs that Apache Kafka provides out of the box (https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/) and tools written by the community and ecosystem. We expect most tools to work out of the box.

Amazon Managed Streaming for Kafka (Amazon MSK)	"Re: Date for General Availability (no longer in Public Preview) for MSK?
MSK is still in Public Preview. 

With regards to production workloads - if the current feature-set that we offer meets your requirements, you should be able to start using the service for production. Clusters created during the preview stage will not be shut-down at GA. If there is anything specific you expect from the service before you bring your production workload, please let us know."
Amazon Managed Streaming for Kafka (Amazon MSK)	"Cluster Creation fails - An error occurred (BadRequestException) when calli
Thought I'd see if MSK could work for us.

The VPC has two private and two public subnets. I'm trying to set up 3 brokers in a single private subnet to compare performance. Following the tutorial yields;.

aws kafka create-cluster --cluster-name ""RTMKafkaCluster"" --broker-node-group-info file://brokernodegroupinfo.json --kafka-version ""1.1.1"" --number-of-broker-nodes 3 --enhanced-monitoring PER_TOPIC_PER_BROKER

Unfortunately I only ever see the following error.

An error occurred (BadRequestException) when calling the CreateCluster operation: The number of Availability Zones in the BrokerAZDistribution parameter must be equal to the number of client subnets.

I have one AZ and one client subnet. What is incorrect here? What is the BrokerAZDistribution param (sounds internal)? Is it just the case that only the tutorial approach is functional (i.e. bespoke VPC)?"

We currently only support a 3 subnet setup. Every subnet must be in a different AZ."
Amazon Managed Streaming for Kafka (Amazon MSK)	"Re: Cluster Creation fails - An error occurred (BadRequestException) when calli
Hi Varun,

While a 3 AZ distribution of Kafka brokers makes total sense from a production data durability perspective.  Wouldn't a single AZ ""test"" data distribution make sense during the preview just to try out the functionality of the AWS managed Kafka service for those that don't yet have a multi-AZ or multi-region VPC configuration?

Thanks,
-Kurt"
Amazon Managed Streaming for Kafka (Amazon MSK)	"Re: Cluster Creation fails - An error occurred (BadRequestException) when calli
Hi Kurt,

Thanks for your feedback. For this test setup that you plan to use the service for, what replication factor would you be using when creating topics? For any replication factor of more than 1, it doesn't help to have all the brokers in the same AZ from an availability perspective, so we felt a multi-AZ setup would be helpful for our customers. Do you have any concerns with creating 3 subnets in 3 AZs? I'm curious to know what challenges you see in creating 3 subnets. 

Thanks again for your interest in our service and for providing feedback.

Amazon Managed Streaming for Kafka (Amazon MSK)	"st1 and sc1 EBS options
Excited about MSK.  The re:Invent presentation talked about feedback from customers during the preview period.  In that spirit, I'd like to put a request in for MSK allowing the use of st1 and sc1 EBS storage.  Could that be on the roadmap?

An AWS blog (https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-ebs-update-new-cold-storage-and-throughput-options/) talks about these EBS options' suitability for Kafka.  A Confluent blog (https://www.confluent.io/blog/deploying-apache-kafka-on-aws-elastic-block-store-ebs/) said ""we observed that these storage volumes delivered the performance and reliability needed for Kafka environments"".  

We need to retain data for a long time, and less expensive storage options would be a big draw for us.  The price benefit outweighs any performance loss for our application.

Thanks for the cool product - JP

Amazon Managed Streaming for Kafka (Amazon MSK)	"Re: CLI/SDK availability on 11/29
In the meantime, since you can probably only launch your MSK cluster from the console, some observations/workarounds:

 * you might need to adjust the ingress rules of your default sg to allow inbound Kafka and Zookeeper traffic. Ports 2181,2182,2888,3888,9092,9093 seem sufficient. 
The --broker-node-group-info option for the cli is how to pick a more suitable sg once the cli is released.

 * you can locate the IP address for your nodes (specifically the Zookeeper cluster) by looking for ENIs with ""Amazon MSK"" in the description. You will apparently do this through the cli via aws kafka get-bootstrap-brokers --cluster-arn ClusterArn
