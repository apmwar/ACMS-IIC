Amazon WorkDocs	"Can't connect to SQL Server 2014 Express AMI
Hello,

When I use the RDP session I only see one Command Prompt window.  I don't see a Windows UI.  Is this AMI bad?

Additionally, I'm trying to remotely connect to the SQL Server that is provided by this AMI.  I have all ports inbound ports open but I can't figure out how to remotely connect and configure it.  I can connect to it locally in the RDP session.

Is there a default port for this SQL instance?

Amazon WorkDocs	"Re: Can't connect to SQL Server 2014 Express AMI
The AMI contains Windows Server Core Install : https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh846323(v=vs.85).aspx, so seeing only Command Prompt is expected.

By default the network services are disabled on SQL Server. Need to restart network services to be able to reach SQL Server (port 1443) from outside server.

Following is the way to enable the networking service:
1. Use netstat -a -b to verify port 1433 is not LISTENING
2. Run C:\Windows\SysWOW64\SQLServerManager12.msc from cmd.exe to open SQL Server 2014 Configuration Manager
3. Follow Steps in Microsoft Article   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/enable-or-disable-a-server-network-protocol?view=sql-server-2017  to check the network status, enable, and restart SQL Server
4. After SQL Server restart, check for port status using netstat -a -b
5. Should be able to connect from other servers after that, off course assuming the port is allowed.

Hope this helps."

Hi.

We have plans to run our application in China region and would like to have some information about possible issues there.

From what I already got - we can't have simple VPN from our EU to CH region. Is it correct?

Our infrastructure includes;

a) Maven to build Java code and Docker images;
b) Docker images to be saved in private registry (CBCcom? As Docker Hub will be too slow);
c) Packer to build AMIs adding Docker images inside;
d) Terraform to update ELB stack with new instances from Packer's AMIs.

As we seem will have EU <=> CN connection issues - currently, we plan to move Jenkins CI to CN instance.

But there are other issues as well:

1. `apt-get install maven` took about 2-3 hours to download all dependencies;
2. `mvn build` hangs on downloading Maven/Java dependencies;
3. an `ssh` connection to EC2 in CN too slow - can't even type commands (I'm writing them in a text editor, and then copy-paste to the terminal).

That's only a few I found at this moment (working from Kiev, not in CH yet).

Maybe somebody had a similar task and have some solution there?

Yes - careful mirror selection is critical here; there are some choices.

2. `mvn build` hangs on downloading Maven/Java dependencies;

Best to mirror  - we also do local caching on Jenkins some times for this.

3. an `ssh` connection to EC2 in CN too slow - can't even type commands (I'm writing them in a text editor, and then copy-paste to the terminal).

After I find the JSON URL : http://status.aws.amazon.com/data.json I had error to retrieve data from it because of CORS.

It would be much easier if this page which is public and aim to distribute information allow CORS from all domain (like Google do with the CORS allow all header).

Amazon WorkDocs	"Re: AWS Status page improvement (JSON and CORS support)
Here is the answer from the AWS engineer contacted through my company :

The JSON version of the AWS Status data that you found is actually an undocumented, internal API that the web page uses.
The official and supported programmatic way of getting AWS status information is to use the various RSS feeds that you see on the page to the right of the table entries.
As you can see, the RSS feed URLs follow a simple naming convention, so you don't need to copy paste them into a large table, instead, you can use any of the popular RSS feed parsers and a few for loops to cycle through all the regions and services that interest you and retrieve their status information.

I hope it can help some people."

Hello,

Hi,I've setup the eclipse toolkit and it is listing my instance but the key pair has a big red 'x' next to its name.  I can also not connect to the instance via the eclipse toolkit. Everything works well in the aws console or elasticfox.  I have the keys in ~/.ec2/ in which they should be detected automatically. What am I missing?  How can I fix this?- Markus"
Amazon WorkDocs	"Re: key pair in eclipse toolkit
Hey Markus,

that red 'x' definitely means the toolkit can't find your private key, just like you mentioned.  

There's two ways to take care of this:
 1 - ensure that the corresponding private keys live in ~/.ec2/ and that the file name is in the form ""<key-name>.pem"" .   It sounds like you've already got your keys in the right directory, so I'm guessing maybe they just have a different file extension?  Some private keys on windows/mac tend to use different extensions depending on which platform they're created for, so maybe the toolkit needs to be aware of that and accept other extensions, too.  If that's what's happening to you, i'll open a bug report so we can add that feature.

 2 - If you can get to EC2 Key Pair widget (in the Launch Wizard for example), you can right click on the key pair and click the ""Select private key file"" menu item to explicitly map a private key to a key pair.  I've got a change open to make it easier to get to that Key Pair widget from the preferences, but until that's submitted and built, you can find it on the Launch Wizard.

Let us know if that helps and if you have any other feedback,

We've done extensive testing with other AWS accounts that we use and there doesn't seem to be any problem.  Its just one of the accounts we use.  From different geographic locations, and various ports, we are unable to connect after allowing access using the AWS management console.

Furthermore, when we delete existing rules, the access remains, for example we blocked the ping/icmp ports and are still able to ping from hosts that should not have access.

this sounds like a tricky one...  I had to search around for info on NTLM, and after searching I found the docs you must have found describing how to disable Apache HttpClient (which doesn't support NTLM), so that Eclipse uses URLConnection (which does support NTLM) when you use the Eclipse Update Manager:
http://wiki.eclipse.org/ECF_Filetransfer_Support_for_NTLMv2_Proxies

Once you get the plugin installed, it uses the AWS client libraries to community with Amazon SimpleDB, which relies on Apache HttpClient, which doesn't support NTLM.

There's not an easy way to change the AWS SimpleDB library to use an HTTP client that supports NTLM, but...

you could try using a free NTLM proxy like Cntlm:
http://cntlm.sourceforge.net/

with that, you should be able to start up the Cntlm proxy on your computer, and tell eclipse to use it as a proxy instead of directly hitting the NTLM proxy.  Cntlm acts as a SOCKS5 proxy, which Apache HttpClient does support."

For a SOCKS5 proxy, it looks like you already know what you're doing, but others reading this thread might find this link interesting: http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/net/proxies.html

Next, check out the ClientConfiguration class in the AWS SDK for Java:
http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/ClientConfiguration.html

There are some additional proxy settings there, although from what I remember, for SOCKS proxies, setting the system properties should work.

Also in ClientConfiguration, you can set the default protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) clients will use to connect to AWS:
http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/ClientConfiguration.html#setProtocol(com.amazonaws.Protocol)

You could try changing that to Protocol.HTTP (the default is HTTPS) and see if that works better with your network configuration.

To use a custom ClientConfiguration object, just pass it in to the AmazonS3Client constructor when you create your client object.

hope that helps.  let us know how it goes,

Hello,

We decided to buy reserved instance m1.large windows server for three years term (Heavy Utilization Reserved Instance). And in your table it shows 1700$ / 3year.
I want to know 
is there  any other charges in addition to this $1700?
because table shows 0.16$/hour for windoews usage . what is this?

Regards
saravana"
Amazon WorkDocs	"Re: reserved instance
Hi pixelsaravana,

That is your hourly rate.  Since you purchased a Heavy Utilization RI, you will pay this hourly rate regardless of whether you launch an instance with the covered RI parameters or not.

So for example in March there are 31 X 24 = 744 hours.  If the term of the RI covers the entire month of March, you would pay 744 X $0.16/hour or $119.04 in hourly charges.  

A One-Time up front non-refundable RI charge gives you the option to later run instances at lower hourly rates than list prices.  For Heavy RIs, you pay the hourly rates whether you run the an instance on the covered parameters or not.

The ""connect by SSH"" button is magical. I had used the command line tools on a unix box to set up AWS, but Iwanted PuTTY to work through ElasticFox on my Windows machine. It wastrivially simple, once I figured out how to do it. It sure would benice to have this built into the documentation.1. Get the id_rsa-gsg-keypair that you generated from your .pems onto your Windows machine.2. Find and open PuTTYgen.exe - mine was not in the PATH but in C:\Program Files\PuTTY3. On the PuTTYgen ""panel"" in the ""Actions"" section press the bigbutton that says ""Load"" to load an existing private key file. Point itto your id_rsa-gsg-keypair.4. In the same part of the PuTTYgen interface, click on the big buttonthat says ""Save in Private key"" to save the generated key. 5. In the resulting dialog box, navigate to your home directory inC:\Documents and Settings[username] (not ""My Documents"" but thedirectory above it.). Make a directory called ""ec2-keys"" and finallysave the file as ""gsg-keypair.ppk""6. You should now be able to connect to a listed instance with PuTTYssh by just pushing the magic button. Of course, this connects you as ROOT from within your WEB BROWSER so use your new terminal to change your root certificate and set up a user account with admin permissions. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!"

Amazon WorkDocs	"Re: How to transfer a domain name I own to Amazon (EC2)
You don't transfer your domain name to AWS.  Rather allocate an Elastic IP address and the associate it to your instance.  Then go to your domain provider and point your domain to the Elastic IP address.  You don't need to transfer your domain to AWS.  You can do this from the AWS management console.In this way, you can start a second instance and test any application updates, then just move the Elastic IP to the second instance without having to make any changes with your domain provider."

Amazon WorkDocs	"Re: How to transfer a domain name I own to Amazon (EC2)
As BrianW@AWS said, you don't transfer the domain name to AWS. They are not a domain registrar. What you want to do is modify the DNS records. If you haven't purchased a DNS service from a third party, then this is probably provided by your current domain registrar. You need to locate any web control panel they might have provided you with or ask them how to update DNS records.

Let's say you want to host your domain www.example.com at AWS. First you launch an EC2 instance, and configure it according to your requirements. In this example you might want to serve web pages for www.example.com, so you install a web server. You will also need a static IP address. AWS calls them Elastic IPs. Get one using the AWS management console and assign to your running instance. Done! You can now go back to your DNS service provider / domain registrar and (ask them to) add an A record for your Elastic IP. Then all requests for www.example.com will be sent to your instance.

There are other hosting options available as well. If you want to host a static website, you can take a look at S3 instead of EC2. Maybe you don't even want to host a website - I just assumed that's what you were looking for."

Hi Bruce,

Recently I saw the EC2 Pricing mentioned

"" 
Free Tier

As part of AWS’s Free Usage Tier, new AWS customers can get started with Amazon EC2 for free. Upon sign-up, new AWS customers receive the following EC2 services each month for one year:

750 hours of EC2 running Linux/Unix Micro instance usage
750 hours of Elastic Load Balancing plus 15 GB data processing
10 GB of Amazon Elastic Block Storage (EBS) plus 1 million IOs, 1 GB snapshot storage, 10,000 snapshot Get Requests and 1,000 snapshot Put Requests
15 GB of bandwidth in and 15 GB of bandwidth out aggregated across all AWS services

Amazon WorkDocs	"Eclipse AWS Plugin & Tomcat Max Memory
All,First off, I'm new to AWS.I am playing around with EC2 and Tomcat WebApps, is there any way to increase the max heap size?  Generally you could do that via the launch configuration for your servet [Tomcat].  But for EC2 Tomcat, the launch configuration doesn't have that capability.So, is there any way to increase the heapsize (-Xmx) for the JVM that will run tomcat?Cheers."

Amazon WorkDocs	"Re: Eclipse AWS Plugin & Tomcat Max Memory
Hello,

I know this thread is a bit old, but I would like to revive it because I too am in a situation where I absolutely need to increase the max heap size of my Tomcat WebApp.

I understand that the Eclipse plugin does not allow for this configuration. Here are two possible alternative approaches:

1) Forget about the Eclipse plugin and do everything manually.
2) Create a modified AIM in which the max heap size is set via some environment variables.

Neither option is great, and I'm not sure whether 2) is even possible. So, to my question: does anybody have any suggestions as to how to best go about this?

Any pointers would be greatly appreciated; it is very frustrating that such a simple configuration is so cumbersome.

Thanks,
Michael."

Hey Michael,

just wanted to make sure you saw that we released AWS Elastic Beanstalk (http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk) last week, along with a big update to the Eclipse tools.

This is a big step up in performance and reliability for deploying Java web applications using the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse, and you'll have access to tweak much more configuration, such as JVM settings.

There's a quick screencast showing the new Eclipse functionality here:

Amazon WorkDocs	"Eclipse Tutorial - Unable to run project
Hi,I am new to the elastic cloud and am trying it out with a view to using it in forthcoming projects.  I started off going though the ""Getting Started with Amazon EC2 Management in Eclipse"" article (from the AWE Toolkit for Eclipse page).I created the application and it successfully runs from eclipse using a local Tomcat instance - no issues.  I then created the server exactly as in the tutorial (5 instances, no elastic ip, same security group (all zeros in each entry), ami-11ca2d78 etc).  The instances all start up and I am able to successfully secure shell into them.When I run the application on this Amazon cluster, I get a message in the Eclipse browser- ""503 Service Unavailable - No server is available to handle this request"".  I have tried several times yesterdayand today and still get this message.I also tried defining a single server (same AMI) in case it was the cluster going wrong.  When I do this I get a message ""Navigation to the webpage was cancelled"" - on refreshing the page as the browser suggests, I get a ""This program cannot display the webpage"".I spent much of yesterday and today playing with this and have been through some other tutorials, each of which defines a single serverand each time I get this set of messages.  There is no difference if I add an elastic IP either.  I have tried on US West and East coast with the same result.I am not sure if there is a step missing somewhere, but I am running the app fine locally and following the steps exactly.  My bill is rising and I have not had a single application.Can someone help me get this working please ?Thanks in advance !"
Amazon WorkDocs	"Re: Eclipse Tutorial - Unable to run project
Hey srisom,

I'm not sure exactly what's happening, but maybe some of these ideas will help turn up a clue...

if you're having problems, simplifying is definitely a good idea.  It sounds like you've already tried with just a single EC2 Tomcat instance without an Elastic IP.  I'd stick with that to start off while you get everything figured out.

Make sure that you're right clicking on the servlet you want to run (whether in the editor or from the package explorer view) and selecting ""run as..."" -> ""run on servier"" then your EC2 Tomcat server.  Clicking directly on the project and selecting ""run as..."" -> ""run on server"" probably won't work because there isn't a default resource defined.

There might also be something in your network configuration causing problems.  If you have to go through a proxy server to get to the internet, you might have some problems using the Eclipse tools since they need to ssh to the EC2 hosts and configure everything.

Another problem I've run into is that port 8080 is blocked by some firewalls, so I have to change my Tomcat configuration to launch on port 80 instead (default is 8080 of course), and make sure that port is also open to CIDR IP 0.0.0.0/0 in your security group like you mentioned.

If you can ssh into the EC2 box, then you might try using curl or wget to hit ""localhost:80"" and see if you can access the server from there.  If so, then it seems likely to be a security group or network firewall/proxy issue.

Finally, don't forget to check the ""Error Log"" view in Eclipse to see if there are any clues in there.

hope that helps,
j"
Amazon WorkDocs	"Re: Eclipse Tutorial - Unable to run project
Jason,Thank you so much for answering and giving some pointers.  I have been through the points and discovered that:1) Right clicking is ok.  I am doing that on the servlet - if I do this and choose my local Tomcat then it all works fine.2) Don't think I am going through a proxy - certainly the browsers have no entries and I have never had to put one in for anything - so this is unlikely.3) I logged on with ssh and from the server tried both curl and wget on localhost ports 80 and 8080.  Both tools failed ('couln't connect to host' from curl and 'Connection refused' from wget).4) I went into the Tomcat/conf directory on the server and swapped both references to 8080 in server.xml to 80, set JAVA_HOME to /env/jdk, ran the shutdown in the tomcat bin directory (this gave a connection refused error) and ran startup without error.  I hope this is correct to change the port.  After doing this I got the same messages from wget and curl.  I tried restarting the Tomcat server from the server view in Eclipse but it terminated the entire server and started a new one (so I lost my port 80 changes).My security group has all zeros set for ports 22,80,443 and 8080.  My local error log is completely empty.I am guessing that the issue is something to do with the connection failures etc on the server but am in the dark as to next steps.Can you offer any advice / suggestions ?Much appreciated !"

Amazon WorkDocs	"Re: Eclipse Tutorial - Unable to run project
I have got a bit further on this.  I discovered by logging into the AMI and checking the processes, that Tomcat is not started.  Trying to start it (setting environment and doing a catalina start) causes a java stack trace.At this point I gave up on this AMI.  I have successfully deployed my app using the Java Web Apps in a Box AMI.  You cannot deploy directly from eclipse but you can export to a WAR file and load into tomcat with no issues.  I am going down that road unless the standard AMI gets sorted.Google 'Java development 2.0:Easy EC2' and follow the IBM step through."

Hey srisom,I just checked out the IBM DeveloperWorks article you mentioned.  it looks like a great walkthrough for Eclipse/EC2/Java/Tomcat.  I'm glad you were able to get that setup working.I'm not sure why Tomcat wouldn't be starting up for you.  I'll see if we can reproduce that over here.  If you or others on the thread see this again, you can launch Eclipse from a command line with the ""-debug -consoleLog"" options, you should get debugging output in your terminal window from the toolkit that provides some clues as to what's happening when something goes wrong when Eclipse is launching the EC2 instances, pushing the application and starting Tomcat.  The output is fairly verbose, so feel free to private message it to me and I'd be happy to take a look and see if we can find any clues."

Amazon WorkDocs	"Re: Eclipse Tutorial - Unable to run project
A Solution!! (I think)

I had the exact same problem, everything working fine locally but could get nothing to run on AmazonEC2. I too noticed from the shell log for catalina.out that tomcat wasn't started.

A day and a half later...

I found the problem to be my server runtime environment in eclipse when you set up the server. It was set as Apache Tomcat V 6.0, of course, but I was using the latest version (6.0.24) and this seems to be the problem. I downloaded an older version from the Tomcat archive (6.0.18) and added this when configuring runtime environments. Setting up an instance with this server runtime environment works!

I hope this helps anyone who stumbles along here.
But why does 6.0.24 not work!!?? Can this be fixed?"

Thanks for that !!  Yes I downgraded my local Tomcat as you suggested - I did mine to 6.0.16 from the archive and it worked first time!  I don't actually run it locally - just on EC2 but this defo sorts the issue!Guess more and more people will start getting this as the currect v6 Tomcat does not work - thank goodness they archive the older versions quite a way back!"

Amazon WorkDocs	"Re: Eclipse Tutorial - Unable to run project
Hey Lemis,

We just released AWS Elastic Beanstalk last week (http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk), which provides a really easy and highly configurable way to run Java web apps on AWS and have them automatically scale with load.

As part of that release, we did a big upgrade to the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse to support AWS Elastic Beanstalk.  We're still using all the same WTP tools in Eclipse, so your workflow shouldn't change much, but there is a new server type you can use: ""AWS Elastic Beanstalk for Tomcat 6"".

I'd definitely encourage you to try the new system; you should see much faster and more reliable performance now that AWS Elastic Beanstalk does all the heavy lifting.

There's a quick screencast showing the new Eclipse functionality here:
http://d1un85p0f2qstc.cloudfront.net/eclipse/elasticbeanstalk/index.html

and also a getting started guide for Eclipse here:
http://aws.amazon.com/articles/4412341514662386

Hope that helps!  Please try out the new tooling and let us know what you think.  It should be a big step up over the previous tooling in Eclipse,

Hi Carl,Why on earth would Amazon require access to a non-standard port for ANY console type of service?  Just use HTTP!  Any communication to the S3 service itself should be on your servers.Many, many companies that need to use this service have very strict and fixed firewall rules (e.g., mine).  Now I cannot use S3 at all at work, since it is nigh impossible to get the firewall access changed at this company.Surely this is a major design flaw that you plan to correct, right?  Right?"
Amazon WorkDocs	"Re: New S3 AWS Mgmt Console is loading and loading and loading...
Agreed - I'm working for a large corporate and have struggled to get approval for any work on the cloud at all - there is no hope of getting a non-standard firewall port opened!

We can work around this by using the command-line tools, but it's going to be a huge barrier to wider adoption of aws here.

Hi Chris,

The S3 Console uses flash to talk to the S3 servers. This has been the case since the S3 console was first released. Given that the iPad doesn't have flash support, the S3 Console would have never been accessible from the iPad. 

As regards the folks having trouble loading the console, would you please provide the ID of the diagnostic report generated by the console test page, and we will investigate.

For those in corporate environments, we are working on a way for you to access the console without making any firewall changes. We will update this thread when new information pertinent to your access issues is available.

Hi tushev,

In order for a service to become active we must validate the credit card on file for the account.  You received a notification that the card was unable to be verified which indicates that the service is not active.

Once the credit card has been properly validated and the service is active you will have access to the management console.

Amazon WorkDocs	"Feedback on the Manamement Console
Hello,

I would like give you some Feedback on the AWS Management Console.

Bugs:

Instances: After launching a new instance the final ""close"" button in the dialog does not work. Only the closing button in the upper right corner works. After that, sometimes the ""launch instance"" button does not work any more.
Security Groups: It is not possible to add a new custom rule with protocol, port and group. Only predefined ones or custom but without group or custom with group but without specific protocol and port. The html form fields are always cleared by JavaScript.
Security Groups: When you add rule to group A, the switch to group B and then back to A it says ""No records found.""
Sometimes the navigation ""AWS | Products | Developers ..."" in the upper right corner shifts down to the tab ""Amazon S3 | Amazon EC2 ..."".
Account, Personal Information: The form does not work with special characters, e.g. München (Munich).


My browser is Chrome 7.

Apart from this it would be great to add multiple security groups to one instance.

First EC2 page after login: Not everyone is an American and using the default region. So why is it displayed always the first time? Even for people just using e.g. eu-west-1. It would be much better to see the actually used EC2 region first.

Amazon WorkDocs	"Re: Feedback on the Manamement Console
Thanks for taking the time to give us feedback!  We will take a look and see what we can improve.

A couple things:

You can select any number of Security Groups in the Launch Instances Wizard (use cmd-click or alt-click on Security Groups).  

For custom Security Group rules, the Console only supports Group rules or protocol/port/cidr rules.
That is, if you specify another group in your rule, you are allowing instances in the target group full access to the instances in the allowing group.
Security Groups are a confusing topic, we hope to improve the UI for them in the future.

And finally, yes, the navigation (and other things) may compress in funny ways if the browser width is too narrow.

The AMI contains Windows Server Core Install : https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh846323(v=vs.85).aspx, so seeing only Command Prompt is expected.

By default the network services are disabled on SQL Server. Need to restart network services to be able to reach SQL Server (port 1443) from outside server.

Following is the way to enable the networking service:
1. Use netstat -a -b to verify port 1433 is not LISTENING
2. Run C:\Windows\SysWOW64\SQLServerManager12.msc from cmd.exe to open SQL Server 2014 Configuration Manager
3. Follow Steps in Microsoft Article   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/enable-or-disable-a-server-network-protocol?view=sql-server-2017  to check the network status, enable, and restart SQL Server

Here is the answer from the AWS engineer contacted through my company :

The JSON version of the AWS Status data that you found is actually an undocumented, internal API that the web page uses.
The official and supported programmatic way of getting AWS status information is to use the various RSS feeds that you see on the page to the right of the table entries.
As you can see, the RSS feed URLs follow a simple naming convention, so you don't need to copy paste them into a large table, instead, you can use any of the popular RSS feed parsers and a few for loops to cycle through all the regions and services that interest you and retrieve their status information.

Hi,I've setup the eclipse toolkit and it is listing my instance but the key pair has a big red 'x' next to its name.  I can also not connect to the instance via the eclipse toolkit. Everything works well in the aws console or elasticfox.  I have the keys in ~/.ec2/ in which they should be detected automatically. What am I missing?  How can I fix this?- Markus"
Amazon WorkDocs	"Re: key pair in eclipse toolkit
Hey Markus,

that red 'x' definitely means the toolkit can't find your private key, just like you mentioned.  

There's two ways to take care of this:
 1 - ensure that the corresponding private keys live in ~/.ec2/ and that the file name is in the form ""<key-name>.pem"" .   It sounds like you've already got your keys in the right directory, so I'm guessing maybe they just have a different file extension?  Some private keys on windows/mac tend to use different extensions depending on which platform they're created for, so maybe the toolkit needs to be aware of that and accept other extensions, too.  If that's what's happening to you, i'll open a bug report so we can add that feature.

 2 - If you can get to EC2 Key Pair widget (in the Launch Wizard for example), you can right click on the key pair and click the ""Select private key file"" menu item to explicitly map a private key to a key pair.  I've got a change open to make it easier to get to that Key Pair widget from the preferences, but until that's submitted and built, you can find it on the Launch Wizard.

Let us know if that helps and if you have any other feedback,

We've done extensive testing with other AWS accounts that we use and there doesn't seem to be any problem.  Its just one of the accounts we use.  From different geographic locations, and various ports, we are unable to connect after allowing access using the AWS management console.  We also tested ElasticFox and the java CLI api, and we have the same result.  

Furthermore, when we delete existing rules, the access remains, for example we blocked the ping/icmp ports and are still able to ping from hosts that should not have access.

My computer is behind a NTLMv2 proxy so I succeeded in installing AWS Toolkit only after I disabled the ECF httpclient provider.Now, my attempts to test my connection to Simpledb service fail so I guess the problem is due to the presence of this proxy, but I have no Idea how I can workaround it: can you help me?Thanks"
Amazon WorkDocs	"Re: AWS Toolkit for Eclipse: proxy problem
this sounds like a tricky one...  I had to search around for info on NTLM, and after searching I found the docs you must have found describing how to disable Apache HttpClient (which doesn't support NTLM), so that Eclipse uses URLConnection (which does support NTLM) when you use the Eclipse Update Manager:
http://wiki.eclipse.org/ECF_Filetransfer_Support_for_NTLMv2_Proxies

Once you get the plugin installed, it uses the AWS client libraries to community with Amazon SimpleDB, which relies on Apache HttpClient, which doesn't support NTLM.

There's not an easy way to change the AWS SimpleDB library to use an HTTP client that supports NTLM, but...

you could try using a free NTLM proxy like Cntlm:
http://cntlm.sourceforge.net/

with that, you should be able to start up the Cntlm proxy on your computer, and tell eclipse to use it as a proxy instead of directly hitting the NTLM proxy.  Cntlm acts as a SOCKS5 proxy, which Apache HttpClient does support."

Amazon WorkDocs	"Re: AWS Toolkit for Eclipse: proxy problem
Hey Mark,

the very first thing I'd do is figure out exactly what your proxy settings are (i.e. SOCKS5 vs. HTTP, host, port, is a username/pass required, etc.)

For a SOCKS5 proxy, it looks like you already know what you're doing, but others reading this thread might find this link interesting: http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/net/proxies.html

Next, check out the ClientConfiguration class in the AWS SDK for Java:
http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/ClientConfiguration.html

There are some additional proxy settings there, although from what I remember, for SOCKS proxies, setting the system properties should work.

Also in ClientConfiguration, you can set the default protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) clients will use to connect to AWS:
http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/ClientConfiguration.html#setProtocol(com.amazonaws.Protocol)

You could try changing that to Protocol.HTTP (the default is HTTPS) and see if that works better with your network configuration.

To use a custom ClientConfiguration object, just pass it in to the AmazonS3Client constructor when you create your client object.

hope that helps.  let us know how it goes,

Amazon WorkDocs	"Re: reserved instance
Hi pixelsaravana,

That is your hourly rate.  Since you purchased a Heavy Utilization RI, you will pay this hourly rate regardless of whether you launch an instance with the covered RI parameters or not.

So for example in March there are 31 X 24 = 744 hours.  If the term of the RI covers the entire month of March, you would pay 744 X $0.16/hour or $119.04 in hourly charges.  

A One-Time up front non-refundable RI charge gives you the option to later run instances at lower hourly rates than list prices.  For Heavy RIs, you pay the hourly rates whether you run the an instance on the covered parameters or not.

Get the id_rsa-gsg-keypair that you generated from your .pems onto your Windows machine.2. Find and open PuTTYgen.exe - mine was not in the PATH but in C:\Program Files\PuTTY3. On the PuTTYgen ""panel"" in the ""Actions"" section press the bigbutton that says ""Load"" to load an existing private key file. Point itto your id_rsa-gsg-keypair.4. In the same part of the PuTTYgen interface, click on the big buttonthat says ""Save in Private key"" to save the generated key. 5. In the resulting dialog box, navigate to your home directory inC:\Documents and Settings[username] (not ""My Documents"" but thedirectory above it.). Make a directory called ""ec2-keys"" and finallysave the file as ""gsg-keypair.ppk""6. You should now be able to connect to a listed instance with PuTTYssh by just pushing the magic button. Of course, this connects you as ROOT from within your WEB BROWSER so use your new terminal to change your root certificate and set up a user account with admin permissions. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!"

Help anyone? Thanks"
Amazon WorkDocs	"Re: How to transfer a domain name I own to Amazon (EC2)
You don't transfer your domain name to AWS.  Rather allocate an Elastic IP address and the associate it to your instance.  Then go to your domain provider and point your domain to the Elastic IP address.  You don't need to transfer your domain to AWS.  You can do this from the AWS management console.In this way, you can start a second instance and test any application updates, then just move the Elastic IP to the second instance without having to make any changes with your domain provider."

Amazon WorkDocs	"Re: How to transfer a domain name I own to Amazon (EC2)
As BrianW@AWS said, you don't transfer the domain name to AWS. They are not a domain registrar. What you want to do is modify the DNS records. If you haven't purchased a DNS service from a third party, then this is probably provided by your current domain registrar. You need to locate any web control panel they might have provided you with or ask them how to update DNS records.

Let's say you want to host your domain www.example.com at AWS. First you launch an EC2 instance, and configure it according to your requirements. In this example you might want to serve web pages for www.example.com, so you install a web server. You will also need a static IP address. AWS calls them Elastic IPs. Get one using the AWS management console and assign to your running instance. Done! You can now go back to your DNS service provider / domain registrar and (ask them to) add an A record for your Elastic IP. Then all requests for www.example.com will be sent to your instance.

There are other hosting options available as well. If you want to host a static website, you can take a look at S3 instead of EC2. Maybe you don't even want to host a website - I just assumed that's what you were looking for."

Hi Bruce,

Recently I saw the EC2 Pricing mentioned

"" 
Free Tier

As part of AWS’s Free Usage Tier, new AWS customers can get started with Amazon EC2 for free. Upon sign-up, new AWS customers receive the following EC2 services each month for one year:

750 hours of EC2 running Linux/Unix Micro instance usage
750 hours of Elastic Load Balancing plus 15 GB data processing
10 GB of Amazon Elastic Block Storage (EBS) plus 1 million IOs, 1 GB snapshot storage, 10,000 snapshot Get Requests and 1,000 snapshot Put Requests
15 GB of bandwidth in and 15 GB of bandwidth out aggregated across all AWS services

Amazon WorkDocs	"Re: AWS Toolkit for Eclipse Don't Work
Hey diegoahgora,

My guess is that something happened when copying the DTP-1.7 plugins/ and features/ folders into your Eclipse install.

Since you're using Eclipse-3.5 Galileo, you don't need to do anything extra to get the right version of DTP.  (That's only necessary for Eclipse-3.4 Ganymede.)

Try re-downloading a fresh install of Eclipse-3.5 Galileo (JEE distribution) from the link you included, and then try installing the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse from http://aws.amazon.com/eclipse .

Hope that helps.  Let us know how it goes!

I have installed Eclipse for Java EE Developers 3.6 and have jdk 1.6 as well. I am unable to install the AWS for Eclipse plugin via Help -> Install New Software menu in the eclipse IDE. It is repeatedly returning ""Read Timed Out"" error. 
I have downloaded the AWS plugin zip file from github - but not sure where I should extract it to as part of the eclipse folder. Am new to eclipse IDE. Can you please help? Thanks."
Amazon WorkDocs	"Re: AWS Toolkit for Eclipse Don't Work
Hey devdeals,

Try installing the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse from the Eclipse Marketplace client (""Help"" -> ""Eclipse Marketplace..."" -> then search for AWS).  That might be an easier way to get everything installed.

let us know if that helps,
j"
Amazon WorkDocs	"Re: AWS Toolkit for Eclipse Don't Work
Hi jason,
Thanks for the quick response.

Tried Eclipse Marketplace also. Am getting the same ""Read Timed Out"" error. Can I unzip the aws zip directory from github or sourceforge to install the plugin? If yes, which location in the eclipse program folder do I extract the zip file to?

I am on Windows XP SP3."
Amazon WorkDocs	"Re: AWS Toolkit for Eclipse Don't Work
Only the source is available through GitHub, you need the built plugins/features.  You should really use Eclipse's update manager, otherwise it's very easy to get your Eclipse install in a bad situation by installing plugins manually (ex: you won't get proper plugin dependency checking).

Are you able to view this URL:
http://aws.amazon.com/eclipse/site.xml 

Eclipse pulls that first, then pulls the individual plugin/feature zip files from Amazon CloudFront.

Try opening Eclipse's ""Error Log"" view and see if there are any stack traces or extra information available there.

Amazon WorkDocs	"Eclipse AWS Plugin & Tomcat Max Memory
All,First off, I'm new to AWS.I am playing around with EC2 and Tomcat WebApps, is there any way to increase the max heap size?  Generally you could do that via the launch configuration for your servet [Tomcat].  But for EC2 Tomcat, the launch configuration doesn't have that capability.So, is there any way to increase the heapsize (-Xmx) for the JVM that will run tomcat?Cheers."

In the launch config, it does sayfor additional configuration, open the server's editor under ""server"" view.More Info:I am using eclipse 3.5Under MacOSX.If I click on the EC2 cluster, I can do ""show in > debug or console"".  Nothing happens when I do that.If I click open, then it goes to the server overview page..."

Hey ericg22, 

you can't currently configure JVM level settings through the EC2 Tomcat WTP server.  It's a great feature request though."
Amazon WorkDocs	"Re: Eclipse AWS Plugin & Tomcat Max Memory
Hello,

I know this thread is a bit old, but I would like to revive it because I too am in a situation where I absolutely need to increase the max heap size of my Tomcat WebApp.

I understand that the Eclipse plugin does not allow for this configuration. Here are two possible alternative approaches:

1) Forget about the Eclipse plugin and do everything manually.
2) Create a modified AIM in which the max heap size is set via some environment variables.

Neither option is great, and I'm not sure whether 2) is even possible. So, to my question: does anybody have any suggestions as to how to best go about this?

Any pointers would be greatly appreciated; it is very frustrating that such a simple configuration is so cumbersome.

Thanks,
Michael."

Hey Michael,

just wanted to make sure you saw that we released AWS Elastic Beanstalk (http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk) last week, along with a big update to the Eclipse tools.

This is a big step up in performance and reliability for deploying Java web applications using the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse, and you'll have access to tweak much more configuration, such as JVM settings.

Amazon WorkDocs	"Eclipse Tutorial - Unable to run project
Hi,I am new to the elastic cloud and am trying it out with a view to using it in forthcoming projects.  I started off going though the ""Getting Started with Amazon EC2 Management in Eclipse"" article (from the AWE Toolkit for Eclipse page).I created the application and it successfully runs from eclipse using a local Tomcat instance - no issues.  I then created the server exactly as in the tutorial (5 instances, no elastic ip, same security group (all zeros in each entry), ami-11ca2d78 etc).  The instances all start up and I am able to successfully secure shell into them.When I run the application on this Amazon cluster, I get a message in the Eclipse browser- ""503 Service Unavailable - No server is available to handle this request"".  I have tried several times yesterdayand today and still get this message.I also tried defining a single server (same AMI) in case it was the cluster going wrong.  When I do this I get a message ""Navigation to the webpage was cancelled"" - on refreshing the page as the browser suggests, I get a ""This program cannot display the webpage"".I spent much of yesterday and today playing with this and have been through some other tutorials, each of which defines a single serverand each time I get this set of messages.  There is no difference if I add an elastic IP either.  I have tried on US West and East coast with the same result.I am not sure if there is a step missing somewhere, but I am running the app fine locally and following the steps exactly.  My bill is rising and I have not had a single application.Can someone help me get this working please ?Thanks in advance !"
Amazon WorkDocs	"Re: Eclipse Tutorial - Unable to run project
Hey srisom,

I'm not sure exactly what's happening, but maybe some of these ideas will help turn up a clue...

if you're having problems, simplifying is definitely a good idea.  It sounds like you've already tried with just a single EC2 Tomcat instance without an Elastic IP.  I'd stick with that to start off while you get everything figured out.

Make sure that you're right clicking on the servlet you want to run (whether in the editor or from the package explorer view) and selecting ""run as..."" -> ""run on servier"" then your EC2 Tomcat server.  Clicking directly on the project and selecting ""run as..."" -> ""run on server"" probably won't work because there isn't a default resource defined.

There might also be something in your network configuration causing problems.  If you have to go through a proxy server to get to the internet, you might have some problems using the Eclipse tools since they need to ssh to the EC2 hosts and configure everything.

Another problem I've run into is that port 8080 is blocked by some firewalls, so I have to change my Tomcat configuration to launch on port 80 instead (default is 8080 of course), and make sure that port is also open to CIDR IP 0.0.0.0/0 in your security group like you mentioned.

If you can ssh into the EC2 box, then you might try using curl or wget to hit ""localhost:80"" and see if you can access the server from there.  If so, then it seems likely to be a security group or network firewall/proxy issue.

Finally, don't forget to check the ""Error Log"" view in Eclipse to see if there are any clues in there.

hope that helps,
j"
Amazon WorkDocs	"Re: Eclipse Tutorial - Unable to run project
Jason,Thank you so much for answering and giving some pointers.  I have been through the points and discovered that:1) Right clicking is ok.  I am doing that on the servlet - if I do this and choose my local Tomcat then it all works fine.2) Don't think I am going through a proxy - certainly the browsers have no entries and I have never had to put one in for anything - so this is unlikely.3) I logged on with ssh and from the server tried both curl and wget on localhost ports 80 and 8080.  Both tools failed ('couln't connect to host' from curl and 'Connection refused' from wget).4) I went into the Tomcat/conf directory on the server and swapped both references to 8080 in server.xml to 80, set JAVA_HOME to /env/jdk, ran the shutdown in the tomcat bin directory (this gave a connection refused error) and ran startup without error.  I hope this is correct to change the port.  After doing this I got the same messages from wget and curl.  I tried restarting the Tomcat server from the server view in Eclipse but it terminated the entire server and started a new one (so I lost my port 80 changes).My security group has all zeros set for ports 22,80,443 and 8080.  My local error log is completely empty.I am guessing that the issue is something to do with the connection failures etc on the server but am in the dark as to next steps.Can you offer any advice / suggestions ?Much appreciated !"

Amazon WorkDocs	"Re: Eclipse Tutorial - Unable to run project
I have got a bit further on this.  I discovered by logging into the AMI and checking the processes, that Tomcat is not started.  Trying to start it (setting environment and doing a catalina start) causes a java stack trace.At this point I gave up on this AMI.  I have successfully deployed my app using the Java Web Apps in a Box AMI.  You cannot deploy directly from eclipse but you can export to a WAR file and load into tomcat with no issues.  I am going down that road unless the standard AMI gets sorted.Google 'Java development 2.0:Easy EC2' and follow the IBM step through."

Hey srisom,I just checked out the IBM DeveloperWorks article you mentioned.  it looks like a great walkthrough for Eclipse/EC2/Java/Tomcat.  I'm glad you were able to get that setup working.I'm not sure why Tomcat wouldn't be starting up for you.  I'll see if we can reproduce that over here.  If you or others on the thread see this again, you can launch Eclipse from a command line with the ""-debug -consoleLog"" options, you should get debugging output in your terminal window from the toolkit that provides some clues as to what's happening when something goes wrong when Eclipse is launching the EC2 instances, pushing the application and starting Tomcat.  The output is fairly verbose, so feel free to private message it to me and I'd be happy to take a look and see if we can find any clues."

A Solution!! (I think)

I had the exact same problem, everything working fine locally but could get nothing to run on AmazonEC2. I too noticed from the shell log for catalina.out that tomcat wasn't started.

A day and a half later...

I found the problem to be my server runtime environment in eclipse when you set up the server. It was set as Apache Tomcat V 6.0, of course, but I was using the latest version (6.0.24) and this seems to be the problem. I downloaded an older version from the Tomcat archive (6.0.18) and added this when configuring runtime environments. Setting up an instance with this server runtime environment works!

Hey Lemis,

We just released AWS Elastic Beanstalk last week (http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk), which provides a really easy and highly configurable way to run Java web apps on AWS and have them automatically scale with load.

As part of that release, we did a big upgrade to the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse to support AWS Elastic Beanstalk.  We're still using all the same WTP tools in Eclipse, so your workflow shouldn't change much, but there is a new server type you can use: ""AWS Elastic Beanstalk for Tomcat 6"".

I'd definitely encourage you to try the new system; you should see much faster and more reliable performance now that AWS Elastic Beanstalk does all the heavy lifting.

There's a quick screencast showing the new Eclipse functionality here:

Amazon WorkDocs	"Re: New S3 AWS Mgmt Console is loading and loading and loading...
Hi Carl,Why on earth would Amazon require access to a non-standard port for ANY console type of service?  Just use HTTP!  Any communication to the S3 service itself should be on your servers.Many, many companies that need to use this service have very strict and fixed firewall rules (e.g., mine).  Now I cannot use S3 at all at work, since it is nigh impossible to get the firewall access changed at this company.Surely this is a major design flaw that you plan to correct, right?  Right?"
Amazon WorkDocs	"Re: New S3 AWS Mgmt Console is loading and loading and loading...
Agreed - I'm working for a large corporate and have struggled to get approval for any work on the cloud at all - there is no hope of getting a non-standard firewall port opened!

We can work around this by using the command-line tools, but it's going to be a huge barrier to wider adoption of aws here.

The console was working fine with standard http proxy and firewall settings a few months ago when we evaluated Amazon as an option - why this regression?"

Hi Chris,

The S3 Console uses flash to talk to the S3 servers. This has been the case since the S3 console was first released. Given that the iPad doesn't have flash support, the S3 Console would have never been accessible from the iPad. 

As regards the folks having trouble loading the console, would you please provide the ID of the diagnostic report generated by the console test page, and we will investigate.

In order for a service to become active we must validate the credit card on file for the account.  You received a notification that the card was unable to be verified which indicates that the service is not active.

Once the credit card has been properly validated and the service is active you will have access to the management console.

Hello,

I would like give you some Feedback on the AWS Management Console.

Bugs:

Instances: After launching a new instance the final ""close"" button in the dialog does not work. Only the closing button in the upper right corner works. After that, sometimes the ""launch instance"" button does not work any more.
Security Groups: It is not possible to add a new custom rule with protocol, port and group. Only predefined ones or custom but without group or custom with group but without specific protocol and port. The html form fields are always cleared by JavaScript.
Security Groups: When you add rule to group A, the switch to group B and then back to A it says ""No records found.""
Sometimes the navigation ""AWS | Products | Developers ..."" in the upper right corner shifts down to the tab ""Amazon S3 | Amazon EC2 ..."".
Account, Personal Information: The form does not work with special characters, e.g. München (Munich).


My browser is Chrome 7.

Apart from this it would be great to add multiple security groups to one instance.

First EC2 page after login: Not everyone is an American and using the default region. So why is it displayed always the first time? Even for people just using e.g. eu-west-1. It would be much better to see the actually used EC2 region first.

Amazon WorkDocs	"Re: Feedback on the Manamement Console
Thanks for taking the time to give us feedback!  We will take a look and see what we can improve.

A couple things:

You can select any number of Security Groups in the Launch Instances Wizard (use cmd-click or alt-click on Security Groups).  

For custom Security Group rules, the Console only supports Group rules or protocol/port/cidr rules.
That is, if you specify another group in your rule, you are allowing instances in the target group full access to the instances in the allowing group.
Security Groups are a confusing topic, we hope to improve the UI for them in the future.

And finally, yes, the navigation (and other things) may compress in funny ways if the browser width is too narrow.

Hello chris125163,

My name is MD. I'm the GM for WorkDocs application.

Thanks for reaching out to us and sorry for the inconvenience this issue may have caused. As you may know WorkDocs supports unlimited versions of a file. Although each version of a file may only be a few gigabytes, you can quickly consume all your allocated storage if you create many versions of the file. Storage quota is controlled and applied by your site administrator/s.

You have two options:
1. Easiest: if you so wish, you could contact your administrator (WorkDocs web application: Tasks > New Task > Contact Administrator) and request an addition to your storage quota.

2. If you do not wish to keep all the previous versions of the file, please follow these steps:

Download the file to your local machine to a temporary location.
Delete it from the WorkDocs folders (this releases all storage associated with the file).
Upload the file (from your temporary location) back into WorkDocs.
Lastly, and this important: Lock the file in WorkDocs. This will ensure that while updates are made the file and uploaded to the cloud, new versions are not created for each update.


Hope this helps. Apologies for the inconvenience once again.

Thanks,
MD."

Many thanks for your reply.  I have managed to increase my quota.  However, I am now paying for 1.4TB of data when I am actually only using around 800GB.

I suspect what is happening is if there is a glitch in the connection when uploading, the file might start to upload again.  I suspect these partial files are being stored as file versions.  Because I am sending up large video files, these old, imcomplete files are using a lot of storage.

As you say I can delete them from work docs and send them again but it is more than likely that this same situation will occur.  Yesterday I uploaded 4 files totalling 54GB but the total showing in Workdocs is 93GB.

Amazon WorkDocs	"Workdocs - security of sharing problem
Hi

I have setup WORKDOCS, and have a few users.
Each user has powerUser role, apart from myself, admin.

I've setup a shared folder from my drive, to be used for the company shared docs.

There is a hierarchy to the folders in this, and only parts are intended to be available to various levels/individuals.  
For example,
Company>HumanResources>Personnel>StaffOneName

In the folder StaffOneName, I have documents relating to that individual ""StaffOne"".
I gave contributor access to our HR manager at ""HumanResources"" folder level, so the HR manager can save and change documents. create new Personnel folders, and so on.
I gave the individual ""StaffOne"" view access on the folder containing his information, intending that this is all he could access.

In testing via Workdocs web access, I found that ""StaffOne"" can navigate to his folder ""StaffOneName"", but then clicking on the cookie trail links, he can navigate up a folder level to ""Personnel"", then see and navigate down into other staff folders, (eg ""StaffTwoName"" folder) and see other staff member details.

Considering that ""StaffOne"" has not been given any access to higher level or other folders in this hierarchy, nor inherited access to this, he should not be able to do this

This is a major security issue, or  I've missed something understanding how this is supposed to work?  
The documentation on sharing is accurate, but there's no security discussion in those docs, nor suggestion that what I have encountered is possible nor intended. Naturally, security being paramount, that this apparent 'reverse inheritance', should not be possible.

I would appreciate some direction/comment. As a newbie to WORKDOCS, happy for your 'guidance' to my possible misunderstanding or oversight of something.

Amazon WorkDocs	".rename folder holding large amount of data
I have an issue with the sync client not fully removing files.  I have several folders with video files in them that I moved to a folder that is not synced.  This should delete the files from the local drive and it appears to do that.  But it really moves the folders under a .renamed folder.  This is an issue because the files are quite large and need to be removed from the local system.

Is there a way to force a cleanup cleanup job to start or are the files under the .renamed folder removed after a specific period of time?"
Amazon WorkDocs	"Re: .rename folder holding large amount of data
Hi andrewlivingston:

Files would be moved under .rename folder for several reasons ( i.e. files with not allowed characters, trying to upload files to a folder where user doesn't have required permissions etc..)

Here is the suggested for your scenario,
1. Please make a copy of your files/media files on local machine.
2. Uninstall Sync client and remove all folders related to WorkDocs Sync client.
3. Ensure file names doesn't have any excluded items: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workdocs/latest/userguide/sync_client_help.html#sync_excluded_files 
4. Install WorkDocs Drive on your machine. Create a new folder where you want the files to be uploaded and copy from local device to this new folder.

Hello,

Amazon WorkDocs	"Re: Is there any customization option for WorkDocs user interface?
I can only assume that the ability to customize/brand the web client is an upcoming feature due to the language used ""As of now"".  Can someone please please elaborate on what will be possible and provide a timeline?

Personally, I would like to customize/brand the web client per user account. I'd prefer working from a simple XML/JSON file with the data and let me control the GUI. Should be simple enough and I already do that in a native Windows app (document management) my clients are currently using. I'm trying to move my clients away from Windows (Microsoft) and would prefer to use AWS ""if possible"". WorkDocs seems to be quite useful but lacks a lot of features my clients expect. 

A win-win solution would be to offer developers an API (as I noted in another post) that includes the ability to provide their own GUI. WorkDocs can still provide the backend security, management, storage, etc.

I am hopeful AWS (WorkDocs) will realize that some developers may be able to enhance WorkDocs way beyond their wildest dreams with a little help. Please enable us (developers) to do what we do best rather than tying our hands behind our backs.

Thank you in advance for your time and consideration."

Just to clarify, when I say they disappear I don't mean they blink and come back... although I have seen that happen (which was my first indicator it may be WorkDocs doing this to us).  In the three cases recently the icons and taskbar do not come back at all.  But as a follow up to that, I forgot to mention that on the one that happened while I was using the computer (opening WorkDocs), when I brought up the Task Manager there was no explorer.exe running on it.  So I just started a new explorer.exe and my icons and taskbar all came back.

Amazon WorkDocs	"How to invite users from a Trusted Domain?
We currently have our WorkSpaces setup to provision users from a Trusted Domain (i.e. our AWS Directory has a trust relationship with an on-prem directory).

But when we try to provision/invite those users to WorkDocs, it only lists users in the AWS Directory, not the ones in the trusted domain.

How can we provision WorkDocs to our WorkSpaces users who are in the trusted domain?"

Unfortunately we are unable to give any information as to whether or not there will be a Linux sync client developed. We are constantly developing and improving our services/features which includes clients and supported software so if there is a need for it as requested by our customers then it will most definitely be considered for future development.

Amazon WorkDocs	"Re: Will there be a linux sync client?
4 and half years later, still not even a whimper. AWS' general apathy towards providing Linux support for many of its offerings is depressing. To date, there is no Linux support for Workdocs or Workspaces. Workmail is well supported on Outlook, but not so well on Thunderbird, Evolution, etc. After waiting this long, our organization has finally made the decision to move on. There are competing products and companies out there that fully support Linux. So I guess we'll try our luck elsewhere."

Amazon WorkDocs	"Document Properties Search? Bespoke options?
Hi, I'm evaluating WorkDocs with a view to migrating a client from a different document management system. While what WorkDocs does, it seems to do very well, it is very weak on its searching capabilities. For example: 

document content search is not supported and 
the documentation is poor, so I don't even know if AND, OR searching is permitted.


If WorkDocs is to be taken seriously the searching needs to be improved. 

MS Office Document Properties Search?
But what is really killing this opportunity is the lack of document properties searching. My client extensively tags documents using MS Office properties, and their current solution allows filtering, sorting, and searching on these. Without at least a properties search capability WorkDocs is not a viable solution. 

I get that it doesn't do this out-of-the-box, but I've looked at the SDK, at ElasticSearch, ... and I can't even see how I'd bespoke this within AWS. Anyone got any ideas?

Thanks
Pete"
Amazon WorkDocs	"Re: Document Properties Search? Bespoke options?
Hello Pete -

Thanks for reaching out.

I'm MD, Sr. Manager, Engineering in the WorkDocs team. This is a very timely post. We are in the process of launching a SmartSearch functionality even as we speak. Note that the feature is already generally available and you should be able to access it from the Search bar when you sign into the web application. SmartSearch also supports searching for Labels and several other document properties.

That said, I would like to take a moment and discuss a few of these items with you. I will send you a private message to check if we can perhaps schedule a call to discuss.

Thanks,

Amazon WorkDocs	"How do I create a group in WorkDocs with a Simple AD?
When sharing a file or folder with a lot of users (who can add/edit documents and provide feedback), I would like to be able to share with a group/alias as opposed to manually entering each user. 

The WorkDocs instance is set up to Simple AD. Most of the users that need to access the files/folders are outside of my org. I saw in one of the WorkDocs guides that it's only possible to share with directory groups, not email distribution lists.

I found instructions to ""add users and groups to simple AD,"" but I was hoping there'd be a much easier way to create a group in WorkDocs. Is there? If not, I would like to make a request: please add functionality that will allow WorkDocs administrators to create groups/assign users to groups from the admin control panel in WorkDocs.

Amazon WorkDocs	"Unable to set initial password for WorkDocs
Hey all,

I've created a WorkDocs site and received the `Welcome to Amazon WorkDocs` email.

However, I'm not able to proceed from that point on. When I enter the password (as generated by my password manager, 100 characters), the form gets annotated with `Restrictions met`, but clicking `Update User` gives me the following error:

```
The password you have entered doesn't adhere to the password policy set by your Administrator. Please contact your Administrator for more details.

I've tried a number of generated passwords. So one of two things can help me here:


how can I get past this as is?
how can I modify the password policy for the WorkDocs site?


I've attempted to find a way to modify the password policy from the attached Directory Service (a `Simple AD` service, as default), but there isn't any apparent way to do this.

I have created a new WorkDocs site the same way I did two sites prior to that with the same user assigned as admin. The site shows as ""active"" but I am unable to login getting ""Authentication Failed

The other two sites are working fine (with the same user credentials), the only noticeable difference is that on clicking the new site url from the console and plugging in the email address the ""Username"" field is not pre-populated with that address like it is for the two that work.

Google is pulling the same crap which of course is not an excuse. IT should wake up and put down their feet letting such companies know that this is not acceptable. Then again who are you going to talk to as their is no contact... This leaves the only choice of not buying into their services.

Amazon WorkDocs	"Location of new WorkDocs Drive on disk
Hi,
I was using the old WorkDocs and it's location on disk was C:\Users\akiyano\WorkDocs.
If I wanted to access it via WSL I could go to /mnt/c/Users/akiyano/WorkDocs/.

Now there is the new WorkDocs Drive that adds a W:\ drive and now the WorkDocs path is W:\My Documents.

A few questions about this:
1. It seems that these are 2 separate locations on the disk and the WorkDocs client syncs between them. So does this mean WorkDocs now takes twice as much place? If so how do I avoid this?
2. I want to continue using WorkDocs in WSL but the only drive WSL sees is C:\ how do I access W:\?

Thanks,
Arthur"
Amazon WorkDocs	"Re: Location of new WorkDocs Drive on disk
G'day Arthur,

The new WorkDocs Drive client, which has replaced the older sync client, presents the 'W:' drive volume as a network mounted drive. On Windows 10 under the Windows Subsystem for Linux network drives will need to be explicitly mounted before they're available.

You should be able to execute the following commands from your WSL bash prompt when you have WorkDocs Drive mounted and running:
$ sudo mkdir /mnt/w
$ sudo mount -t drvfs W: w
$ cd /mnt/w
$ ls

Here's the copy/paste of my command line entries and output in WSL bash:
streetp@******:/mnt$ sudo mkdir /mnt/w
streetp@******:/mnt$ sudo mount -t drvfs W: /mnt/w
streetp@******:/mnt$ cd /mnt/w
streetp@******:/mnt/w$ ls
My Documents  Shared With Me
streetp@******:/mnt/w$ ls -la
total 0
drwxrwxrwx 1 root root 512 Dec 31  1979 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 512 Sep  5 11:07 ..
drwxrwxrwx 1 root root 512 Jun 29 18:22 My Documents
drwxrwxrwx 1 root root 512 Jul 11 15:36 Shared With Me

You can find more info related to improvements to WSL filesystem mounting here at Microsoft's site:
https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/wsl/2017/04/18/file-system-improvements-to-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux/

Please let me know if that works!
