Amazon AppStream 2.0	"No emails coming from Appstream
Everything was working great until today, noone is able to receive emails from Appstream, several users on different domains. I checked my account by resending the email about stack assignment, which was working before, but now I also dont get the emails. 
Im not sure how to troubleshoot an Amazon service that worked until recently, seems like the emailing is all done under the hood. Any suggestions other than opening a Support case (did that and am waiting)? TIA...

Amazon AppStream 2.0	"File and Folder Names Upcased Sometimes
Wonder if anyone else has experienced upcasing of file and folder names.

My apps are MS Windows Explorer and MS Visio.

This is not happening all the time but may be consistent during a session.
Logging out and back in may fix the problem, but not always.
It appears to have improved with last release, but is still there.  May have been fixed for MS Windows Explorer.

For MS Windows Explorer, both folder and file names are upcased and I think, but am not positive, that all of them are or none of them are.

For MS Visio, symptom is that while the filename is mixed case it appears upcased in the Visio window shown in the filename at the top of the window.  I am running VB within Visio and I think the VB API returns upcased file and path names.  I'm pretty sure that if the filename appears correct, the API will also return correct file and path.

My workaround is to keep logging out/in until it works.  Pretty painful.

I can't yet provide an always fails scenario.

Anybody have any thoughts.

Thanks.

Amazon AppStream 2.0	"7 Minute Fleet Outage When InUseCapacity goes to 0
I am using default settings is setting up fleet.
Running along fine with ActualCapacity and InUseCapacity = 1.
On logout of the one active session both ActualCapacity and InUseCapacity go to 0.
On logout shouldn't ActualCapacity stay at 1?
There is a 7 minute delay before ActualCapacity goes to 1 and I can login again.
Anyone else experiencing something similar and is there a fix.
Especially frustrating since this means after last user logs out no one can login for 7 minutes.
Thanks.

Amazon AppStream 2.0	"Re: 7 Minute Fleet Outage When InUseCapacity goes to 0
Hi PaulV45 -

Each AppStream instance is dedicated to a single user. At the end of their streaming session, the streaming instance is terminated. If the scaling policies and fleet size stipulate it, a new streaming instance will then be provisioned. Depending on the size and contents of your image, it can take a few minutes to create the new instance and make it available.

In your case, since your fleet size is set to 1 instance, ActualCapacity will go to 0 as there are no remaining usable instances available. After a few minutes (7 minutes for your image), a new instance is made available.

You can mitigate this gap by using a scale-out policy such that when capacity utilization is >= 100%, a new instance is created. Please keep in mind you are charged for running instances. If you use an on demand fleet, the unused instances are charged at a lower stopped instance rate until it is powered on for a user to stream from.

Hope this helps.

Amazon AppStream 2.0	"Re: 7 Minute Fleet Outage When InUseCapacity goes to 0
Hi Murali,

Thanks for explanation.  While I'm not quite sure I got it all, I submit there is case that in fact is not handled properly.  Here's are two scenarios.

Normal:

Start point -- running along with ActualCapacity=1, InUseCapacity=0.
User logs in in -- ActualCapacity=1, InUseCapacity=1.
Scaling kicks in -- ActualCapacity=3, InUseCapacity=1.
User logs out -- Actual Capacity=3, InUseCapacity=0.
After a while scaling takes to ActualCapacity=1
Now back at start point -- ActualCapacity=1, InUseCapacity=0.

Life is wonderful!

Problem: 

Start point -- running along with ActualCapacity=1, InUseCapacity=0.
User logs in in -- ActualCapacity=1, InUseCapacity=1.
User logs out before scaling kicks in.





Should take to ActualCapacity=1, InUseCapacity=0. (i.e. back to start point)
Actually takes to ActualCapacity=0, InUseCapacity=0 and 7 minute delay before anyone can login.







The end result is a pretty ugly UX particularly when a demo situation

Attached is a screenshot which while your explanation may cover,  I'm hoping the team finds difficult to call ""works as desired.""

Thanks for looking at this with me.

Is there any update on support for Safari browsers on Apple devices? I too was surprised that Safari was not supported. We have been following the updates to AppStream 2 and experimenting with it since we discovered it at the end of last year and are very impressed so far.

Also, I was hoping there was a way to access the service on tablets and was informed about the Amazon AppStream Basic Client by an Amazon employee. However, this appears to be only applicable for AppStream 1 (I notice it was last updated in 2015, so before AppStream 2) and does not work when I have tried it on an iPad and iPhone.

Amazon AppStream 2.0	"Run Tableau Registration/Activation Script in Image Instance before Launch
Hello,

I have a brief script that will run and register Tableau in the registry (using both .bat files and a PowerShell Script) and also activate a license key for Tableau ahead of time for the user. These commands are run through a script run on startup and shutdown, like shown in this thread: https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=261492.

Although it is clear that my script is successfully making edits to the registry ahead of time, my script still only partially works. First of all, it includes commands to activate a product key on Tableau, which it doesn't do. Secondly, part of the script launches the program, which it also doesn't do.

It would seem that the script is doing all commands not associated with Tableau, is there any way to make this work? Could it be that the script can't see the directory Tableau.exe is in an image instance?

For reference, this is an example of a command that doesn't work:
""C:\Program Files\Tableau\Tableau 2018.3\bin\tableau.exe"" -register 

If so, where would I need to store the executable to make it accessible to a script?

 - Are you facing this issue with other users connecting to the stack/fleet?

The way Home Folder integration works is that we mount the S3 folder when users connect to their applications. So, the mounting application needs complete and unrestricted access to the 'My Files' folder. If your application is trying to access this folder to read/write files from it as soon as it launches, the mounting application will face issues while trying to mount the folder.

  - Does not have Home Folder as their working directory
  - Waits at least 10 seconds before trying to access (Read/Write in) the Home Folder

Hi, I sent you a PM with the information that you requested.
I can confirm that the application does NOT use the home folder as it's working directory.

The only time that the Home folder is accessed is when a user manually loads, saves or uploads files to the home folder.

To clarify further, I already have another stack and fleet that is running Solidworks just fine. The reason why I created a separate stack and fleet was because users were reporting poor performance on the fleet where everything works fine. So I created a copy of the existing image assigned to a more powerful instance type on a new fleet. Outside of this everything else is configured the same way. This new fleet is where users are reporting the problems.

3- This can be determined by your end user use case. First option, you can install a mail client on the image and configure it with the user settings and make it the default email application. Example for enabling default OS and application settings for your users [3]. Then use that image with a fleet that has a persistent settings. When an end user launches a new session and use your hosted app and initiate an email function, it should bring the mail client on. Second option, if the mail has multiple users and varied by users, you may want to configure the mail client with no user settings, so users can configure the login during the mail step with their credentials. Third option, you use AWS WorkMail [4]. Once you configure WorkMail you can use its web console with your hosted app as your mail provider. 

I hope this comes as a helpful answer.

Amazon AppStream 2.0	"Re: Replacing Local Domain Controller With SaaS in AppStream 2.0
Thank you for such a quick reply. 

In addition to those questions which are mostly clear, I have a couple more.

Can the AppStream service be redundant? Can I replicate the app and all data and changes written to the app to a smaller E2 instance in case of outages in my primary region?

Amazon AppStream 2.0	"Re: Replacing Local Domain Controller With SaaS in AppStream 2.0
Hello Chrom,

	""Can the AppStream service be redundant? Can I replicate the app and all data and changes written to the app to a smaller E2 instance in case of outages in my primary region?""

	In terms of redundancy you can use the AppStream 2.0 Home Folder. It's S3 bucket mounted to a folder path in the user profile of the AppStream 2.0 session. When you enable the S3 Home Folder feature on a stack, AppStream 2.0 will automatically create the required S3 bucket, and begin using it. The first time a user logs in and saves a file, the path will be created in the S3 bucket, and the files uploaded. See more details in [1]. Yes, you can use the Home Folder to read/write from your Application. 

	If you prefer to write your Application data to another instance. You can basically use our FSx service with AppStream 2.0. FSx is like DFS, you can create shared folders and mount them using Group Policy. You can follow our article [2] that explains FSx with AppStream 2.0. 

	""How does one backup files/directories in Appstream?""

	If you use either of the options I mentioned above you should be able to backup the data. If you are using the home folder it's already in S3 while you can connect from any servers within the same VPC or has a route and permissions to the FSx shared folder to back it up.

If you're attempting to access the S3 Home Folder bucket from within the instance, it is mounted to a folder path in the Windows user profile. You can find more details here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/latest/developerguide/home-folders.html

Please note that AppStream does not support using the S3 Home Folder as a working directory for your application. If the application attempts to write files to the Home Folder location before the S3 bucket mount has completed, the S3 bucket mount may fail.

If you're attempting to access the S3 Home Folder from the AWS Management console, or programmatically, you will need to access the S3 bucket that is created automatically: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/latest/developerguide/home-folders.html#home-folders-s3

Amazon AppStream 2.0	"Re: Is it possible to run a script/batch file during instance boot?
Hi Sibar -

You can use local policies in the Image Builder to set scripts that run on instance startup or user logon. On the Image Builder, search for ""gpedit.msc"" in the start menu, and launch the ""Edit Group Policy"" item. Navigate to Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Scripts (Startup/Shutdown) or User Configuration > Windows Settings > Scripts (Logon/Logoff) to set the script. Keep in mind instance startup scripts may execute before the network is available. You can set a separate policy to prevent this: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg486839.aspx

When a user tries to access the applications in your stack, a new instance is created.

If you want to avoid this situation, you must increase the minimum capacity of the fleet.

Does that apply to On-Demand instances too?"
Amazon AppStream 2.0	"Re: Error: ""There are no streaming resources available""
Hi Hamish -

Yes, that's correct. The fleet must have enough instances available for the user when they login, regardless of Always On or On-Demand fleet type. However, with Always On fleets, the user will get connected to a streaming instance immediately. With On-Demand fleets, the user will wait about 90 seconds for a streaming instance to be powered up and become available.

In both fleet types, the streaming instance must already be created for the user to stream applications from.

Hope this helps.

Amazon AppStream 2.0	"Re: Error: ""There are no streaming resources available""
Thank you,

That actually makes sense. I was under the mistaken impression that the 90 second wait included spinning up the streaming resource.

Am I correct in assuming the following:

  * The time it takes to spin up the new streaming resource is the same amount of time it takes to start a Fleet? In my case, that's about 10 minutes
  * The StoppedInstance charge I see on my bill will be multiplied by the number of dormant On-Demand instances?

Your fleet is unable to scale further due to the limits applied to your account. Please use this link to submit a limit increase request: https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/v1?region=us-east-1#/case/create.

Hi dluk -

If you're using Powershell, one common issue is the Windows Powershell execution policy that prevents scripts from running. You'll want to use a bat file to call Powershell with the execution policy set. Here's an example: https://blog.netspi.com/15-ways-to-bypass-the-powershell-execution-policy/ (#9 specifically)

That said, AppStream's default policy prevents regedit from running. In order to enable regedit, this policy will need to be overridden: https://www.thewindowsclub.com/prevent-access-to-registry-editor-windows. This requires Administrator privileges or running as System (scheduled task on user logon can accomplish this)

Hello Murali,

Thank you for responding!

I have created a .bat file that will call my PowerShell script with the command from #9 of the link you gave me. Essentially it is just a .bat file that runs PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File Register_Run.ps1 to call my PowerShell file. I tested it, and it works perfectly fine in my image builder, however I have just created an image containing this script and will see if it works for editing the registry in an image instance.

I am attempting to edit the registry HKCU:\Software\Tableau\Registration\Data to register a User with Tableau automatically.

As you can see I already linked to https://www.thewindowsclub.com/prevent-access-to-registry-editor-windows in my previous post. I have checked using GPEDIT in the Image Builder, and it would appear that Prevent access to registry editing tools has been set to disabled. Similarly, using REGEDIT I could not find the DisableRegistryTools and had to create it and set it to 0 (false). The DisabledRegistryTools soon disappeared again after I manually created it in the image builder. However, I haven't done the last one using this link. 

I have added the line:
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System /v DisableRegistryTools /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f 
Both in it's own individual script that I have set to be called on startup, and before my .bat file makes any edits to the registry.
Attached is a screenshot of me attaching the script to a logon policy, let me know if this is the wrong way to do it.

James"
Amazon AppStream 2.0	"Re: Home folders disk performance
Hi mrflibbles -

Can you provide more details?

The S3 Home Folder feature syncs files to the S3 bucket within your account. When the user accesses the file, the file is hydrated to the EBS volume for the streaming instance, and then becomes available for use. After the file is fully downloaded from S3, the performance should match that of the EBS volume.

If your application relies on lots of small files and is chatty, the Home Folder may not provide sufficient performance to meet the needs of your application. If your file requirements are low, you could use the application settings persistence VHD instead. This volume is fully downloaded to the streaming instance EBS volume before the user session, and will match the EBS volume performance. You can learn more here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/latest/developerguide/app-settings-persistence.html

The ADFS server/relay combo requires me to authenticate as user@blah.com and then the SAML relay from the ADFS server is working and I get authenticated with AWS and I land on the fleet catalog page. 

I click the required starting app and I get the loading settings message ... but after the user application settings have completed loading I am still getting prompted to enter the password for user@blah.com on the fleet instance I have been assigned to.

Have I missed an important step somewhere in the set up on my ADFS server or is this a known restriction?"
Amazon AppStream 2.0	"Re: Always Have to Login Twice even when ADFS and Fleet are in the same domain?
Hi roj007 -

You should be able to configure seamless authentication to your ADFS provider when the end user device is joined to the same domain, removing the logon prompt.

AppStream's password prompt when the fleet is joined to the domain is currently unavoidable, as there is no simple way to convert the SAML token to a Windows authentication token. We are working on improving this experience, however, I don't have a timeline I can share today.

Amazon AppStream 2.0	"Re: Fatal Error AutoCAD won't launch on the Test user, but works on Template
Have you made any progress on this? I'm having the exact same issue. Was just wondering if you came across a fix over the last few months.

Update:
Just in case anyone else is hitting their head against a wall with this issue like I was, I wanted to add what I did that finally got this to work. Because OP hinted at using a PowerShell script to adjust the values, I went in that direction as well. However, OP didn't get into whether or not the solution was put into place outside of the Image Builder.

At first, I attempted using the PS Script as a Logon Script through local policy (remember to adjust the delay https://goo.gl/Mqasch). That fixed the issue when using the Test user before snapshotting, but as soon as the image was in a Fleet, the same thing would happen. Then, I tried using a Scheduled Task to run the script at the logon of any user, but with the logon script via policy, it worked in test but not in a Fleet. 

Finally, thinking that AppStream functions more like an RDP session instead of a true interactive logon, I added a trigger to the Scheduled Task to run on connection to a user session. Success! With the Scheduled Task to run on connection to a user session, I am no longer getting this error when the image is in a Fleet!

Here is the script I wrote to accomplish this. I'm sure there are better ways to write this, but wanted to include it here.

$GCF = ""$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Autodesk\AutoCAD 2019\R23.0\enu\GraphicsCache\""
$LRF = ""$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Autodesk\AutoCAD 2019\R23.0\enu\""
$RRF = ""$env:APPDATA\Autodesk\AutoCAD 2019\R23.0\enu\""

Amazon AppStream 2.0	"How to stage content and create a shortcut to it
Hi all -

Sometimes you may want to stage content in your image for all your users to use, such as demo files or templates. The easiest way to do this is to create a folder in the C: drive, and then map a network share to it as the Template user. The fleet Windows user will have the drive share, and the user will be able to see it in the file dialogs of their applications.

To stage content and make it visible for your users:
1) Connect to a running image builder that has your applications already installed and configured. If you don't have one, create a new image builder off of your existing application image. When prompted, select the Administrator user.
2) Launch Explorer, navigate to the C: drive, and create the folder your files will reside in. For this example, it will be C:\Demo Files.
3) Populate C:\Demo Files with the content you want all users of your image to have.
4) When completed, choose Switch User from the AppStream toolbar. When prompted, select the Template user.
5) Launch Explorer, choose the Computer tab, then choose Map network drive.
6) For the drive letter, choose a letter E or above. C & D are reserved for AppStream and will not work.
7) For the folder path, enter in the network path to the folder. From my example above, the path is \\localhost\C$\Demo Files
8) Ensure ""Reconnect at sign-on"" is selected, then choose finish.
9) The new network share should appear in the Explorer window. Once it appears, choose Switch User from the AppStream toolbar, then choose Administrator.
10) Launch Image Assistant from the desktop. If you need to specify additional applications, do so now. Otherwise, select next.
11) Choose ""Save settings"" to copy the settings from the Template user.
12) Continue through Image Assistant as you normally would to create the image.

Once the image has been created, apply it to a new or existing fleet. When your users stream, they will now see the staged content that you placed in the image.

We are wondering about the copy/paste behavior in the streaming session. We start it up, our app opens. There is text in a text box; we highlight that and press Ctrl-C.

In Windows 10 and 7 with Chrome, we can then go to a desktop app (say Notepad), press Ctrl-V, and the text from that streaming session gets pasted to Notepad -- no need to click the Clipboard icon on the AppStream session.

On Mac, Linux, Win 7 (Firefox, IE) we have to use the AppStream clipboard management icon and popups. 

Is this a Chrome thing or (fingers crossed) a settings thing? Is there any way we can get it in more places, or is the absence of the feature in all other browsers the reason for the icon/popup solution?

Thanks for the clarification."

Hi bigEntian -

The details of the seamless clipboard support are in our tech docs here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/latest/developerguide/troubleshooting-general.html#copy-paste-doesnt-work

The summary is that AppStream has enabled support for the W3C browser specification for clipboard interactions. Currently, only Google Chrome version 66 and later has implemented these APIs. Once the other browsers implement the APIs for the W3C browser specification, AppStream's seamless clipboard will automatically work from them too.

Hope this helps.
