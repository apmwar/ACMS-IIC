C++ Development	"Re: How to deploy a DAPP/smart contract to an ethereum network?
Hey there,

I was struggling with this yesterday and I made a small discovery that would make your life a lot easier. 

When you are setting up the Blockchain you have a section called Ethereum options that gives you a set of three addresses that are comma separated to start with. Chuck in your metamask public address and now that address is supplied with a good chunk of ether.

Once it has been created you take the RPC URL and connect to that network through metamask. This might require you to set up the SOCKS proxy on your own network in mac/win (Currently trying to get an API to work through which we can connect with keys). If it is all working well and swell you should now see that your address has the supplied ETH in that network. Mine sure does!

With this setup you can now deploy through remix by using your web injected metamask client. And transfer all the ETH from your account to any other accounts if required. 

Hope this helps a bit."

C++ Development	"Feasibility of using blockchain technology
Hi

I'm investigating the feasibility of using blockchain technology in a proposed real-estate-rentals web application. Major features of the application are (a) the vetting of tenants based on rental-payment and credit history; and (b) the management of financial transactions between tenants/agents and agents/landlords. My understanding is that blockchain technology is suitable for applications in which there is a lack of a central arbiter of transactions. In a web application such as the rentals one I've described, there will be a central arbiter in the form of the application's business tier and relational database. Whereas blockchain solutions tend to be used in decentralised systems, most web applications are centralised, aren't they?

I have two questions. Is there a case for using blockchain technology in the scenario I've described? If so, what aspects of the application would be suitable, and why would this approach be superior to handling the aspects centrally?

Thanks

C++ Development	"Ethereum Storage Issues in ECS
I might be missing something but the Blockchain Templates for Ethereum are unusable with public networks at the moment. Geth stores it's data in ~/.ethereum inside the containers. If the node is attached to a public ethereum network like Ropsten or Mainnet, the size of the entire blockchain is 3-6 million blocks. A FAST sync'd geth node (fast is the default) requires about 75GB to be stored in this directory at the moment. Of course the container doesn't have this much storage and fills up pretty quickly. My nodes have only been able to reach 150,000-400,000 blocks before they stall.

I'm wondering why the template doesn't include an EFS mount and ECS volumes for storage? It seems like the template in it's current state is not able to sync with a public ethereum network. It also seems like using EFS could potentially have the benefit of being able to bootstrap autoscaled nodes so they don't have to go through the time consuming initial sync.

I'm happy to fork the Blockchain Templates for Ethereum to attempt to add this EFS mount, but it seems like that would involve manually downloading all the templates from S3 and manually merging them to my fork as they are updated, which isn't ideal. Would love if these templates were published to GitHub."

C++ Development	"Re: How to deploy a DAPP/smart contract to an ethereum network?
Hey there,

I was struggling with this yesterday and I made a small discovery that would make your life a lot easier. 

When you are setting up the Blockchain you have a section called Ethereum options that gives you a set of three addresses that are comma separated to start with. Chuck in your metamask public address and now that address is supplied with a good chunk of ether.

Once it has been created you take the RPC URL and connect to that network through metamask. This might require you to set up the SOCKS proxy on your own network in mac/win (Currently trying to get an API to work through which we can connect with keys). If it is all working well and swell you should now see that your address has the supplied ETH in that network. Mine sure does!

With this setup you can now deploy through remix by using your web injected metamask client. And transfer all the ETH from your account to any other accounts if required. 

Hope this helps a bit."

C++ Development	"Feasibility of using blockchain technology
Hi

I'm investigating the feasibility of using blockchain technology in a proposed real-estate-rentals web application. Major features of the application are (a) the vetting of tenants based on rental-payment and credit history; and (b) the management of financial transactions between tenants/agents and agents/landlords. My understanding is that blockchain technology is suitable for applications in which there is a lack of a central arbiter of transactions. In a web application such as the rentals one I've described, there will be a central arbiter in the form of the application's business tier and relational database. Whereas blockchain solutions tend to be used in decentralised systems, most web applications are centralised, aren't they?

I have two questions. Is there a case for using blockchain technology in the scenario I've described? If so, what aspects of the application would be suitable, and why would this approach be superior to handling the aspects centrally?

Thanks

C++ Development	"Ethereum Storage Issues in ECS
I might be missing something but the Blockchain Templates for Ethereum are unusable with public networks at the moment. Geth stores it's data in ~/.ethereum inside the containers. If the node is attached to a public ethereum network like Ropsten or Mainnet, the size of the entire blockchain is 3-6 million blocks. A FAST sync'd geth node (fast is the default) requires about 75GB to be stored in this directory at the moment. Of course the container doesn't have this much storage and fills up pretty quickly. My nodes have only been able to reach 150,000-400,000 blocks before they stall.

I'm wondering why the template doesn't include an EFS mount and ECS volumes for storage? It seems like the template in it's current state is not able to sync with a public ethereum network. It also seems like using EFS could potentially have the benefit of being able to bootstrap autoscaled nodes so they don't have to go through the time consuming initial sync.

I'm happy to fork the Blockchain Templates for Ethereum to attempt to add this EFS mount, but it seems like that would involve manually downloading all the templates from S3 and manually merging them to my fork as they are updated, which isn't ideal. Would love if these templates were published to GitHub."

Hi all,

I'm sorry for any trouble you may have experienced with your Amazon Web Services accounts. 

If your phone number is not verified, you will not be able to sign up for most of the services. This is one of the steps in fully activating your services.  You can request an automated phone verification call here:

https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?redirect_url=https://aws.amazon.com...

Enter the phone number you’d like to be associated with your account, and we'll call you with a PIN number. Enter the PIN number using your phone's keypad when prompted. Once verified, your services will activate within 24 hours.

If you don't receive the verification call, we're happy to manually verify your phone number. You can create a support case using the link below:

https://aws.amazon.com/support/createCase

Select the ""Phone"" option and enter your phone number. We'll call you back as soon as possible.

When you sign up for a new AWS service, the process of validating your credit card information and activating your account can take up to 24 hours in some cases. Once we have verified your account details, you will receive e-mail confirmation that your service has been activated and you should have immediate access to the service.

My domain is managed by Microsoft Office 365 and my emails are there and like Microsoft to manage it anyway.
I like to see how to connect my WordPress Instance to my domain ""domain.com  + www.domain.com""
and if I need to assign my domain here at AWS and where?
Thanks in Advance

Hi,

I am trying to add a new data set in Quicksight from S3. The file in S3 is a text file with space separating the columns.

What delimiter I need to specify in the manifest file for Quicksight to understand the columns correctly? I tried delimiter = "" "", but it does not show any data in preview and 0% success when I try to visualize. When I try deliminer=""\t"", it does read the all the lines, but each row is read as one whole string rather than separate values. I have pasted couple of lines from the text file below.

We would love to know the answer to this too! As I understand it, access to the higher levels of AWS Activate is only via an incubator programme and the ""Programme Director"" in the text you quote is the programme director of the incubator that you have joined. In our case, we don't need the funding that goes with an incubator - or the costs either. We have been on the AWS Activate Builder's Programme and that has been extremely useful, but we will soon run out of credit on it. We would really like to get onto the AWS Activate Portfolio programme to support us throughout the final stages of our prototyping and product launch, but we don't want to join an incubator which is going to tie our hands."

After discussing with the aws architect it appears the role settings are correct:
AWSS3ReadOnly
AWSGlueFullControl
AWSAthenaFullControl

Assigning trust of the Redshift user account to the role was done correctly.

Adding the role to the AWS Cluster was done correctly.

The copy command was the only thing done incorrectly. 

The trick is that the S3 bucket path must point to a folder containing the .parquet file, not the file itself.  Any file found in the folder is assumed to be uploaded as a parquet file.

I  am keen to know about testing performance of AWS big data system .

As per AWS documents , there are 4 stages of the bigdata processing.

•	Ingest (Amazon Kinesis/batch job inputs)
•	Store (Amazon S3/Amazon Glacier/RDS)
•	Process (Amazon EMR/Redshift)
•	Visualize (some third party tool)

In general, I understand that this could be tested by measuring memory utilization, data throughput and processing time in each stage.

I am just wondering how we can test each component's at each stage.. Does Amazon provide required measurements/logs for each component? or do we require to configure third party monitoring tools such as New Relic? 

Also, I am keen to know how we can test below.

•	Real time feeds in ingest phase. i.e Kinesis.. Can we expect AWS components are performing well? Or if we really need to know how it performs, how we can get required performance measurements?
•	Visualization tool performance 'cos I understand that graphs in visualization tool cannot be tested using automation scripts. What could be the best approach for this? How does analytic tools work? Is it directly getting data from data ware houses? or does it maintain a local database? I am just considering general scenarios only.

In addition to that, I would like to know if it is required to do failover test, can we consider AWS components out of scope considering the fact that those are highly available? Can we bring down Kinesis to test real time feeds/ Can we bring down S3 bucket/Redshift to test data storing capability?"

Hi,

We're using the CUSTOM_AUTH flow to implement our own MFA, which is skipped for remembered devices. We've been able to authenticate existing devices while using this flow but hit a road block.

C++ Development	"tableview devices segue to IoT shadow control MQTT Websocket disconnected
I'm creating an iOS app that opens with a table view of all the user's registered devices. Each device is an automated awning registered with Amazon IoT. The user can tap on a cell to proceed to a new scene where they can view the device's current angle and whether automation is on/off. I'm basing my IoT code for the second view on Amazon's Temperature Control sample (https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-ios-samples/blob/master/IoTTemperatureControl-Sample/Swift/IoTTemperatureControlSample/ViewController.swift).

However, when it proceeds to the second view, my debug session says:

connection status = 1
Connecting...
connection status = 3
Disconnected
I copied my code from the second view over into a new project without a table view (just AppDelegate and ViewController) and a thingName hard coded. It works perfectly. My original project signup/signin using AWSMobileClient. (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-mobile/latest/developerguide/add-aws-mobile-user-sign-in.html) Removing that makes no difference on the original project, nor does adding it to the new project. I also tried hardcoding the thingName.

I'm still a little new to iOS and AWS development, so help will be greatly appreciated.

Hi all,

Setting up billing alert leaves me with a little uncertainty. I am using a instance started in Oregon. When I try to set up billing alerts somehow I'm defaulted to N. Virginia. I get this message (see screen shot). Now if I select N.Virginia and then select EC2 instances I see none. If I select Oregon then I see my instance.

This answer is completely unsatisfactory. 
I signed up for the Free 12 month trial service.
There are an insane number of services all included in the consolidated billing.
If I were an enterprise (I was a financial analyst for a multi-billion dollar international insurance company for several years), I would be shocked and confused.
With my simple billing, I get ""previews"" of billing, with the disclaimer that the actual invoice will have the final correct billing.
The billing is always off by a couple of percentage points.
Why such complicated confusion?"

C++ Development	"Frequent Intermittent issue of disconnection on AWS
Is there any such thing like, at a given time, AWS will allow only a few simultaneous connections from a given network? Because, when our site is down at the office(where many people access the site at the same time), I can access it from another network (i.e., my home network). And later, after some time, it is functioning normally at the office as well. This is occurring very frequently these days. If this is the case, are there any services or something like increasing quota which allows more number of simultaneous connections?
We used Elastic IP and later removed it(thinking that Elastic IP could be a problem). We are using a medium instance and the storage is almost double than what we actually use. But the disconnection issue still persists. It says, 'Site cannot be reached' when we try to access our site.

C++ Development	"Re: How to deploy a DAPP/smart contract to an ethereum network?
Hey there,

I was struggling with this yesterday and I made a small discovery that would make your life a lot easier. 

When you are setting up the Blockchain you have a section called Ethereum options that gives you a set of three addresses that are comma separated to start with. Chuck in your metamask public address and now that address is supplied with a good chunk of ether.

Once it has been created you take the RPC URL and connect to that network through metamask. This might require you to set up the SOCKS proxy on your own network in mac/win (Currently trying to get an API to work through which we can connect with keys). If it is all working well and swell you should now see that your address has the supplied ETH in that network. Mine sure does!

With this setup you can now deploy through remix by using your web injected metamask client. And transfer all the ETH from your account to any other accounts if required. 

Hope this helps a bit."

C++ Development	"Feasibility of using blockchain technology
Hi

I'm investigating the feasibility of using blockchain technology in a proposed real-estate-rentals web application. Major features of the application are (a) the vetting of tenants based on rental-payment and credit history; and (b) the management of financial transactions between tenants/agents and agents/landlords. My understanding is that blockchain technology is suitable for applications in which there is a lack of a central arbiter of transactions. In a web application such as the rentals one I've described, there will be a central arbiter in the form of the application's business tier and relational database. Whereas blockchain solutions tend to be used in decentralised systems, most web applications are centralised, aren't they?

I have two questions. Is there a case for using blockchain technology in the scenario I've described? If so, what aspects of the application would be suitable, and why would this approach be superior to handling the aspects centrally?

C++ Development	"Ethereum Storage Issues in ECS
I might be missing something but the Blockchain Templates for Ethereum are unusable with public networks at the moment. Geth stores it's data in ~/.ethereum inside the containers. If the node is attached to a public ethereum network like Ropsten or Mainnet, the size of the entire blockchain is 3-6 million blocks. A FAST sync'd geth node (fast is the default) requires about 75GB to be stored in this directory at the moment. Of course the container doesn't have this much storage and fills up pretty quickly. My nodes have only been able to reach 150,000-400,000 blocks before they stall.

I'm wondering why the template doesn't include an EFS mount and ECS volumes for storage? It seems like the template in it's current state is not able to sync with a public ethereum network. It also seems like using EFS could potentially have the benefit of being able to bootstrap autoscaled nodes so they don't have to go through the time consuming initial sync.

I'm happy to fork the Blockchain Templates for Ethereum to attempt to add this EFS mount, but it seems like that would involve manually downloading all the templates from S3 and manually merging them to my fork as they are updated, which isn't ideal. Would love if these templates were published to GitHub."

Hi all,

I'm sorry for any trouble you may have experienced with your Amazon Web Services accounts. 

If your phone number is not verified, you will not be able to sign up for most of the services. This is one of the steps in fully activating your services.  You can request an automated phone verification call here:

https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?redirect_url=https://aws.amazon.com...

Enter the phone number you’d like to be associated with your account, and we'll call you with a PIN number. Enter the PIN number using your phone's keypad when prompted. Once verified, your services will activate within 24 hours.

If you don't receive the verification call, we're happy to manually verify your phone number. You can create a support case using the link below:

https://aws.amazon.com/support/createCase

Select the ""Phone"" option and enter your phone number. We'll call you back as soon as possible.

When you sign up for a new AWS service, the process of validating your credit card information and activating your account can take up to 24 hours in some cases. Once we have verified your account details, you will receive e-mail confirmation that your service has been activated and you should have immediate access to the service.

We would love to know the answer to this too! As I understand it, access to the higher levels of AWS Activate is only via an incubator programme and the ""Programme Director"" in the text you quote is the programme director of the incubator that you have joined. In our case, we don't need the funding that goes with an incubator - or the costs either. We have been on the AWS Activate Builder's Programme and that has been extremely useful, but we will soon run out of credit on it. We would really like to get onto the AWS Activate Portfolio programme to support us throughout the final stages of our prototyping and product launch, but we don't want to join an incubator which is going to tie our hands."

After discussing with the aws architect it appears the role settings are correct:
AWSS3ReadOnly
AWSGlueFullControl
AWSAthenaFullControl

Assigning trust of the Redshift user account to the role was done correctly.

Adding the role to the AWS Cluster was done correctly.

The copy command was the only thing done incorrectly. 

The trick is that the S3 bucket path must point to a folder containing the .parquet file, not the file itself.  Any file found in the folder is assumed to be uploaded as a parquet file.

I am just wondering how we can test each component's at each stage.. Does Amazon provide required measurements/logs for each component? or do we require to configure third party monitoring tools such as New Relic? 

Also, I am keen to know how we can test below.

•	Real time feeds in ingest phase. i.e Kinesis.. Can we expect AWS components are performing well? Or if we really need to know how it performs, how we can get required performance measurements?
•	Visualization tool performance 'cos I understand that graphs in visualization tool cannot be tested using automation scripts. What could be the best approach for this? How does analytic tools work? Is it directly getting data from data ware houses? or does it maintain a local database? I am just considering general scenarios only.

In addition to that, I would like to know if it is required to do failover test, can we consider AWS components out of scope considering the fact that those are highly available? Can we bring down Kinesis to test real time feeds/ Can we bring down S3 bucket/Redshift to test data storing capability?"
C++ Development	"High CPU Utilization since Friday
Anyone else experiencing high CPU usage. I have T2.xlarge instance running Windows 2016. I have 1 application I use this server for. It's been running great until last Friday 16th. I've stopped my application and still the CPU usage stays around 90 to 100%. NT Kernel & System PID4 is one of the top processes. I've installed updates and rebooted still no luck. 

Thoughts?"
C++ Development	"Re: High CPU Utilization since Friday
If you haven't tried already, you can try stopping your instance, detaching your EBS drives and attaching them to a newly launched EC2 instance . However, before doing that, make sure that the delete on termination attribute for the EBS volumes (especially the root volume) is set to false, or you will end up losing the volumes.

Good afternoon,  I currently have a website hosted elsewhere which I want to move to AWS so I can use the S3 bucket for static web hosting.

C++ Development	"tableview devices segue to IoT shadow control MQTT Websocket disconnected
I'm creating an iOS app that opens with a table view of all the user's registered devices. Each device is an automated awning registered with Amazon IoT. The user can tap on a cell to proceed to a new scene where they can view the device's current angle and whether automation is on/off. I'm basing my IoT code for the second view on Amazon's Temperature Control sample (https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-ios-samples/blob/master/IoTTemperatureControl-Sample/Swift/IoTTemperatureControlSample/ViewController.swift).

However, when it proceeds to the second view, my debug session says:

connection status = 1
Connecting...
connection status = 3
Disconnected
I copied my code from the second view over into a new project without a table view (just AppDelegate and ViewController) and a thingName hard coded. It works perfectly. My original project signup/signin using AWSMobileClient. (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-mobile/latest/developerguide/add-aws-mobile-user-sign-in.html) Removing that makes no difference on the original project, nor does adding it to the new project. I also tried hardcoding the thingName.

Is there any such thing like, at a given time, AWS will allow only a few simultaneous connections from a given network? Because, when our site is down at the office(where many people access the site at the same time), I can access it from another network (i.e., my home network). And later, after some time, it is functioning normally at the office as well. This is occurring very frequently these days. If this is the case, are there any services or something like increasing quota which allows more number of simultaneous connections?
We used Elastic IP and later removed it(thinking that Elastic IP could be a problem). We are using a medium instance and the storage is almost double than what we actually use. But the disconnection issue still persists. It says, 'Site cannot be reached' when we try to access our site.

Can I open multiple EC2's under free tier account and with no charges ? like one Ec2 will take around 30 GB SDD, and another will take another 30."
C++ Development	"Re: Multiple Ec2 under free tier.
As the free tier includes 30 GB of provisioned storage, the first EC2 instance with a 30 GB volume would consume the free allowance if you intend to keep that instance around for the whole month. If you only keep it around for say the first half of the month and then delete it, you are free to set up a new EC2 instance and storage volume for the second half of the month. In general, you could say that all combinations are possible as long as you don't exceed the limit for the month. Whether that is one instance running for the whole month or perhaps ten instances running for a few days doesn't matter.

Note that the free tier offers 750 hours for a Windows EC2 instance, plus 750 hours for a Linux EC2 instance (of a particular size as described on http://aws.amazon.com/free). As a Windows instance usually comes with a ~30GB volume, you would exceed the storage limit and be billed for the overage, though."

Welcome to the AWS Cloud World. It is huge community and very promising. 100% =)

If you have few year in IT as engineer, developer, product or architect, this will give you very good acceleration in learning staff.

2-) what software I need to install on my system and what are system requirements for them ?

Nothing special. You can start with web-browser to walk through all services available in AWS console. You can get free tier (if you have not yet), check this - https://aws.amazon.com/free/

The rest is based on what you plan to do. For example I do use the following: 


Terminal (mac / linux) for AWS CLI (https://aws.amazon.com/cli/), SSH etc.
Atom texteditor (https://atom.io/) for scripts etc
CloudBerry Explorer (https://cloudberrylab.com/explorer) for IAM management, policy validation and S3, Glacier management (upload / download objects)
Remote Management App (for RDP to my EC2 Windows instances) and VNC client (for GUI to with Linux)


3-) is there any book to start AWS with ?

FAQ - https://aws.amazon.com/faqs/ 

If you are lazy to read check - acloud.guru, cloudacademy.com

4-) what is course path to follow ?

Check this - https://cloudacademy.com/learning-paths/aws-fundamentals-1/
If you plan to certify your-self I would suggest acloud.guru (https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate) <= this is very entry point and gives you insights on AWS.
Join User Groups in your region (check this page - https://aws.amazon.com/usergroups/). AWS community is really open and helpful. We do have group in my region, so we share knowledge and help each other.

Hello

We really don't know what to do, and we need help. AWS support in that case acts as a, hmm,  strange blackbox.
My son tried to subscribe on AWS services with his new plastic card. Unfortunately, his bank issued the new card with old billing address (we moved 3 years ago). It was not a problem for Digital Ocean, Aliexpress, Paypal, but it is AWS! 
AWS tried to charge 1$ test payment 2 times and then blocked the account. My son went to his bank, checked everything (support refused to provide any information about problem cause) corrected card's billing address to the right one and asks AWS support to try charge one more time. Simple case, isn't it? No! To unblock it, AWS support requested fax (AWS! At 2017!) with any bill that contains my son's name. 

Well, at the end we got that paper bill with his name, by creating particular pre-payment cell phone bill (bank's assistants were highly wondered by using paper doc). Then, we scanned paid bill to pdf file and emailed it in attach, with adding a link to the pdf on cloud storage as well - no illusions about AWS support remain any more. But they ask fax copy only! I can't imagine where we can get fax machine at 2017, even not speaking about cost of overseas call. I thrown out my old fax modem 10 years ago, my son does not know what is fax machine at all.

Is that AWS strict rules to use fax machine instead of email or we just have got dubious luck to communicate with special tech guy? I have excellent AWS support for my existing account, but I couldn't even think that creation new account could be a giant problem.  We can't get it for 2-nd week.

C++ Development	"Understanding EC2 T2 CPUUtilization x CPUCreditUsage
I need some help understanding de t2 CPUCreditUsage x CPUUtilization of a particular instance. I know that are many threads in the forum explaining it, but I could not figure out yet what should be the best setup in this case. 

I have a t2.2xlarge instance in sa-east-1  (i-0a8acd17f162dbc77) with a web server (nginx+php7.1fpm) and a MySQL server running a high traffic WordPress site. According to CloudWatchIt keep an average CPUUtilization per hour of 5% to 15% between 2am and 7am and 25% to 30% between 7am and 6pm. After 6pm we have a burst in the traffic and the average CPUUtilization goes up to 70% per hour.

The maximum CPUUtilization per minute according to CloudWatch is 10%, but most of the time is 5-6%, between 2am and 7am. Between 7am and 6pm it goes up to 30% but stays most of the time in 20-25% average. After 6pm the maximum CPUUTilization goes up to 100% for 15 minutes and then goes down to 50%, but that's enough to take the server down, because it was consuming CPU Credits between 2am and 6pm even though the average CPUUtilization was never above 30%. 

With these numbers I would think that the CPU Credit Usage would be 0 (or close to it, just burning expired credits) between 02 am and 7am, very low between 7am and 6pm and high after 6pm. But what's happening is that de CPU Credit Usage is average 4/minute before 6am, 10-12 per minute between 7am and 6pm and 20 to 40 per minute after 6pm. It makes the CPU Balance Credit = 0 when we most need it - after 6pm - and the server crashes without CPU.

We are optimizing and patching the code of this site, that is legacy, before we can launch a new version that won't have this kind of unpredictible bursts. We have figure out some unclosed MySQL connections that would stuck in the line and overload the server. We've tried RDS too, but then both servers would go down (RDS and EC2) when we have this kind of traffic burst. The code in this site is legacy and will be replaced soon.

Anyway I need a temporary solution and I thought that using t2 instances would be this solution, saving CPU Credits between 02 am and 6pm and bursting this credits between 6pm and 2am. We've tried a t2.xlarge instance before that was enough for our regular use but it was crashing too. Even the t2.large would keep the site health between the CPU bursts. I thought that a t2.2xlarge would not consume credits so fast but it is, and today it will be probably out of credits too, even with less then 30% average use during the day.

Could somebody help me with this? Is there another solution (load balancer, ELB?) for these CPU consume bursts?"

Hi all - I prefer to develop low code / no code web apps on aPaas services. I have been using a service similar to SalesForce called LongJump since 2008.

It works well and I have created many robust apps quickly, but the service has odd limits on how often you can run processes against your data...which is the main reason I took the time to get data into a system - I want to use it. Also, the cost of storing data is very high. 

I am hoping that AWS is going to offer an aPaas service soon and am looking for any info or buzz if that is something in the works. 

There are other aPaas services including Mendix that sound like they can do all that LongJump can and more, possibly with less limits, however the cost of >$1000 a month is too high for me in my two roles, an independent web app developer and also as a business user in a small, transaction heavy retail business that could greatly benefit from an aPaas platform.

I saw your comment about looking for a low code that helps you focus on building and deploying application instead of low level infrastructure. Please do see below and let me know if you find this interesting and we can connect if you are interested or you can email on info@duplocloud.net

I wanted to introduce my software Duplocloud:
https://portal.duplocloud.net/

DuploCloud is a platform-as-a-service abstraction for AWS, Azure and Oracle Cloud. It is a developer platform that  auto-generates secure infrastructure thereby reducing OpEx. In addition, it enables the application lifecycle
    - with a single sign-on
    - by managing various cloud specific services (e.g. S3, Dynamo, Kinesis, Redshift, SNS..)
         - supporting CI/CD
     - enabling per-application log/metric  aggregation via 3rd party tools like sumologic,  SigFX, Splunk
          - enabling audit trails (app-aware commit history of infrastructure)

How are we different from other cloud orchestrators?
We do not normalize clouds and retain the uniqueness of each cloud by exposing the native services beyond IaaS. Our primary target audience are the developers as against IT Ops (our software is the DevOps in derivative case!)

Zenefits, our biggest customer, runs all of their micro-services infrastructure on DuploCloud with over 75 developers using our software with zero dedicated DevOps engineers.

There are 2 versions of the software:
1. Duplo Enterprise: Installs in customer’s AWS account (managed and paid by the customer)
2. Duplo Live: No AWS account is needed from users (managed and charged-back by DuploCloud)

Hello there, 

Sorry I wasn't so sure where I should contact, as I'm not really seeking for technical support advice, but rather, I'm facing a problem with S3 I'm experiencing.

I've deleted the S3 bucket name as it was in the wrong region.  I wanted to create the bucket again with the same name in a different region, but does not allow this due to name conflict.

C++ Development	"Re: S3 Bucket Name Deleted, cannot recreate due to name conflict.
Hi Thomas,

I think you just need to wait long enough for the name of the deleted bucket to be released. I recently had to do the same thing. After deleting the old bucket, I could not create a new bucket with the same name in a different region for over half-an-hour. As suggested in a similar discussion, you could write a simple script to repeatedly try and create the new bucket every minute or so until it succeeds.

Of course, it's also possible that somebody else has used your bucket name…."

C++ Development	"Does a Dedicated Server for a Sandbox require GameLift?
Hello all,

I am new to Lumberyard and AWS. I am developing a sandbox multiplayer PC game where the host may be a dedicated server or one of the game clients, similar to ARK Survival Evolved, Minecraft, Arma 3, and other such games. There will be no instancing.

After reading up on AWS GameLift, it seems that service is for instanced based games, like Rainbow Six Siege, Mechwarrior Online, and other such games where clients connect to a matchmaking service or are instanced in, and I quote, 
""Q. What types of game genres are recommended for use with Amazon GameLift?
Amazon GameLift works best with multiplayer games that have game sessions that begin and end within a specified time period. Typically, these are multiplayer games in genres like first person shooters, MOBAs, fighting, racing, or sports.""

I also read that Lumberyard requires you to use AWS services to host games which require a dedicated server unless I own and operate my own servers. Again, I quote, 
""Q. Do I have to run my game on AWS?
No. If you own and operate your own private servers, you do not need to use AWS. You also don’t need to use AWS if your game does not use any servers. For example, if you release a free-standing single-player or local-only multiplayer game, you pay us nothing.

Q. Is it okay for me to use my own servers?
Yes. You can use hardware you own and operate for your game.""

I'm not sure if that applies to games such as mine where a dedicated server can be set up on a game server hosting business for people to use to host the client game like with Minecraft, Ark, ARMA, etc, or if it means that ANY dedicated server, I the developer, do not personally own, must use AWS GameLift, even though GameLift is an instancing service and not built for non-session based multiplayer games.

So my question is, do I need to go through AWS (GameLift) or some other AWS service to host any dedicated servers for a multiplayer game where the client can also serve as a host or run a separate PC as a dedicated host? 

To clarify, I had planned on making the dedicated server available for anyone to be able to host their own dedicated server for their clients to play on. Obviously, that usually means renting a server from a game hosting company which is where I become confused, do I need to become the exclusive game hosting company and provide all dedicated servers through GameLift? Or am I misunderstanding the concept of ""privately owned servers""? 

Any help would be appreciated because I am confused."

Hi!

This functionality is not a part of SES itself, but if you are looking for an AWS service the handles this sort of thing, have a look at Cognito here: https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/.

Cognito allows you to register users, and verify their email address (or mobile) — although if you want a one-click verification solution, you'll have build that yourself (it's relatively simple).

C++ Development	"Re: Locale restrictions? Ping just wont work.
Okay, solution!
One of the default rules in the security group for the instance allows (only!) SSL traffic from all IP ranges.  Adding a new rule to allow ICMP traffic doesn't work because the SSL rule excludes ICMP traffic. You have to edit the default rule and add a new line to the rule to allow the ICMP traffic.
Note that you dont appear able to delete the default security group rules, but apparently you can edit them to add lines.
PS: There are no locale restrictions on traffic. That was a red herring.

Since the two databases have different cost structures (Aurora is more expensive), I doubt it. But it can't hurt to ask your account rep.

Keep in mind there's nothing to stop you from moving to Aurora, you'll just lose the money on the reserves.  The reserves don't technically prevent you from changing

Your domain is currently using a different set of name servers. To point the domain to the right name servers, open up the Route 53 Management Console and go to ""Registered domains"". Select your domain. A details page will appear with the current name servers listed on the right hand side. Use the add/edit link to replace those entries with the name servers quoted above. Those are the actual name servers associated with your hosted zone.

As a side note, each Route 53 hosted zone has a separate set of name servers. So you probably had another zone at some point, but ended up with a different one in the end."

choice of DB depends on what type you are using but go look at RDS for mysql etc so its seperate to your actual service (also can be backed up for you etc)

a micro instance is nice a cheap as a start option and you can scale it up to meet your needs at a later time, as for security of the db just configure it so that only your web servers can access it

regards to cost, amazon wont auto scale anything unless you configure it to do so. so creating a single ec2 instance of what ever size you are happy to pay for will be all you have. If you then get ""attacked"" as you put it it would simply just fall over under load.

you can of course configure auto scaling etc but its all your choice so you shouldnt get any unexpected bills."

I have been reading about AWS services for a while now, and I can't seem to nail down the exact solution that suits my company's needs. We would like to provide a very simple HTTP based API, which allows a user to query an RDS. I was initially thinking I could accomplish this by using an RDS, a Lambda function, and an API gateway, ultimately returning the data in json format. 

This all works perfectly, when I don't need to exceed the limits of what the Lambda function can provide. Unfortunately, I have many use cases where I will need to provide hundreds of MB back through the web interface.

Is there some other combination of services I can use, that will provide a similar functionality, without being restricted by returning a small payload? I imagine this may include using the S3 service, but I can't decide how it fits into the picture. I would guess that I can use a Lambda function to query my RDS, somehow dump specific results onto the S3, and then use the API gateway to somehow provide a pointer to the S3 bucket back to the caller, but this is where the details are getting harder to sort out. I'm having trouble finding information about how to connect these dots.

I want to sell an old-school, non-networked, single-user Windows desktop application on Amazon Marketplace.

I created a demo that consists of an Amazon Windows AMI with my application installed.  I can successfully connect to it via RDP, which is more than adequate for my needs.   It works great.

My questions:

1) copy protection - If I deliver my software as ec2 instances, does that mean the user would have the ability to copy my software executables?  Could they create copies of the instance I sell to them without my knowledge?

2) RDP security certificate - What is the easiest way to get my instances to stop warning RDP users that the security certificate isn't from a recognized CA? Is there a general solution for security certificates I can configure on the master instance from which copies would be made, so that my customers would not have be bothered with managing certificates?

3) Windows patching / updates - Similarly, is there a fully automated way to configure my master instance to automatically apply Windows updates and security patches?  And would that capability persist on instance copies delivered to customers?

4) Amazon Marketplace 1-Click Launch vs Appstream 2.0 - Does hosting my Windows application as a Appstream eliminate the need to maintain security certificates and os upgrades?  

5) Amazon Marketplace 1-Click Launch vs Appstream 2.0 - When selling ec2 instances, Amazon Marketplace handles user registration.  If instead I sell my software as an Appstream, how is user registration handled?

Hello,

We just setup a Windows Server 2016 instance on AWS (base/micro). We are not able to deploy to it from Visual Studio 2015. Help is needed.

I'm trying to setup the server with the exact same configurations as our previous Windows Server 2008 instance. The 2008 instance has run out of space which is our reason for migrating to 2016. Deploying to 2008 from VS works. Deploying to 2016 from VS doesn't.

Here's what I've done:


Exported old websites and app pools from 2008 to 2016 (IIS 7.5 on 2008, IIS 10.0 on 2016).



Tested responsiveness of websites with simple AJAX calls from my local computer. The websites are web API's. All calls to the API's require a security token. The security token is retrieved with a call to the API to get the token. In other words, each call is a two step process: 1) request the security token, 2) use the security token in a second request to do what you actually want. The request to get the security token works. The secondary request does not. <-- This tells me that the API's are responsive but there is a further complication with the secondary request. Not sure if it is the same problem with trying to deploy from Visual Studio.



Did a complete install of Web Deploy 3.5 x64 (tried 3.6 but a google search told me that someone tried that, didn't work, revert back to 3.5, and it started working; that plus our 2008 instance has 3.5 installed). Once installed, Web Deployment Agent Service showed up in services with the description ""Remote agent service for the Microsoft Web Deploy 3.5"". According to https://www.iis.net/learn/publish/troubleshooting-web-deploy/web-deploy-error-codes#ERROR_DESTINATION_NOT_REACHABLE, I need to have either Web Management Service or Remote Agent in order to make the server ""reachable"". It looks like Web Deploy installed Remote Agent. Google didn't give me anything on how to install Web Management Service.



Configured the firewall to open an inbound TCP port on 8172 with no restrictions or limitations.



Repeated the same through the AWS console. Assigned the same security group that was on the 2008 instance to the 2016 instance (see attachment: launch-wizard-1 security group.png).



Updated my publish profile in Visual Studio to hit the 2016 instance with the new password, but it fails the validation test (see attachment: publish profile failed validation.png). Note that the error message directs me to the same website I linked to above, only it doesn't mention anything about Remote Agent. Makes me wonder if I NEED Web Management Service and if so, how to install it (the 2008 machine seems to work fine with Remote Agent).

C++ Development	"Customizing ElasticBeanstalk deployment hooks
ElasticBeanstalk offers you pre-configured application environments which are sufficient for many applications. However, you may want to customize the application container as your development goes on. Although you can create a custom AMI and specify it in your environment configuration, you would have to manage AMI by yourself if you do so. 

ElasticBeanstalk supports config file based container customization. By including config files with "".config"" suffix into .ebextensions in your application project, ElasticBeanstalk reads the files when you deploy the project and configures the application container accordingly. 
See: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/customize-containers.html

The feature can be used to customize the deployment hooks executed when ElasticBeanstalk receives a new software version to deploy. 

ElasticBeanstalk executes three different sets of hooks when a version is deployed, namely, pre, enact and post hooks. Each hook executes executable files stored in specific directories under /opt/elasticbeanstalk/hooks/appdeploy, i.e. 

pre hook executes /opt/elasticbeanstalk/hooks/appdeploy/pre/*,
enact hook executes /opt/elasticbeanstalk/hooks/appdeploy/enact/*, and
post hook executes /opt/elasticbeanstalk/hooks/appdeploy/post/* .


The files stored in the above directories are executed in the alphabetical order, so if you know what is in the directories (you can just login to one of the instances and check), you can execute a set of your preferred commands at the right timings by putting files with appropriate names.

As you can find in the above document about customizing container, it is possible to write config files which create files arbitrary directory and set appropriate mode and owner ID. This means that you can create a config file to add commands to execute before, on and after a deployment task runs. 

For example, the following config file adds a script to download an archive from S3 and unpack just after software package is downloaded and unpacked in the tmp directory. This is useful, for instance, to skip Rails asset compilation at each and every node in the auto scaling cluster. 

files:
  ""/opt/elasticbeanstalk/hooks/appdeploy/pre/01a_bootstraup.sh"":
    mode: ""000755""
    owner: root
    group: root
    content: |
      #!/usr/bin/env bash
      cd /var/app/ondeck/public
      s3cmd get s3://mybucket/assets.tgz
      tar xvzf assets.tgz


Here is another example. This one adds a script to start a background worker after the deployment has finished. It is useful if you want to run a resque worker in a ruby environment.

files:
  ""/opt/elasticbeanstalk/hooks/appdeploy/post/99_start_resque_worker.sh"":
    mode: ""000755""
    owner: root
    group: root
    content: |
      #!/usr/bin/env bash
      . /opt/elasticbeanstalk/support/envvars
      cd $EB_CONFIG_APP_CURRENT
      if [ -e /var/run/resque.pid ]; then
        kill `cat /var/run/resque.pid`
      fi
      chown $EB_CONFIG_APP_USER /var/run/resque.pid
      su -c ""PIDFILE=/var/run/resque.pid BACKGROUND=yes RAILS_ENV=production \ 	QUEUE=default bundle exec rake environment resque:work"" $EB_CONFIG_APP_USER


Hope you find it useful and enjoy the flexibility of ElasticBeanstalk."

Hey David@AWS — how else can someone run a hook after the app has deployed? Looking at the possible customization options for ebextensions don’t include anything that runs after an app has loaded. For example, I’m using a docker container and want to run something once the container is running, this doesn’t appear possible without using the above approach of inserting a hook via ""files"".

C++ Development	"Billing best practices
Not sure if this is the right forum to post this into, but here goes.

I have submitted a number of tickets to AWS, trying to ask them to explain exactly what is my daily cost for.
The scenario is this:
I have around 25 EC2 instances, (most of them t2.medium, 4 x t2.large, 1 x c4.xlarge and 1 x m3.xlarge)
I also run 3 x load balancers (ELB) in VA
They are ALL reserved instances.
Now... I did have a few non-reserved instances until the 13-th of this month, when I reserved all of them.

Now... My problem is that I still have a LOT of daily cost, even though all my stuff is reserved.
I just want to know if there's something I'm missing. The AWS support always told me to look at the calculator, etc, but every time I do that, there's still a huge inconsistency, in the cost explorer.

Basically LAST MONTH (August) I had about 4 x t2.large and 1 x c4.xlarge NON-RESERVED, and paid $X amount. Right ?
THIS month (Sept.), I have reserved all my instances, and I'm ending up paying MORE than last month, and my daily cost actually INcreased.

I have not only double-checked to see if the availability-zone and region and instance type match, I went the extra mile to ask the AWS support to CONFIRM that all of those machines are reserved.

And they DID confirm that in a ticket.
Again: just wondering about what could I missing out on ?

Thanks."
C++ Development	"Re: Billing best practices
Reservations are not as simple as its reserved or its not, and im not sure what you mean by they confirmed that machines are reserved"" as thats not how reservations work

When you reserve and instance you reserve capacity and nothing more, it doesnt actually tie to a specific instance as you can stop and restart instances and the discount will be applied. You will need to check exactly where you reserved your instances and what type of reservations you have as untill very recently this was even more complicated.

If you get daily cost even after reserving multiple things could be an issue

1- you chose partial reservation, this just means you pay a chunk upfront and get a hourly discount on the ondemand costs. If your running 24/7 you may well have meant to purchase all upfront but this def shouldnt result in you paying more now than before.

2 - Check where your reservations are, if you have chosen us-east-1 zone A for your reservation but you have launched to zone B then your reservation will not apply and you will pay full on demand price

3 - Check the type of instance, if you have purchased classic reservations but are launching into a VPC then your reservations will not apply and you will pay the on demand price

4 - Double check your instance types - they are very specific  c4.xlarge will not get a discount from any other type

I know this sounds obvious but its very subtle

Very recently AWS launched a simplified version of reservations that if you dont care about actual capacity reservation in a particular zone but just want the discount you can alter them to be regional reservations making it less likely to go wrong.

The other increase could well be data, ELB IIRC charge by the data transit"

Yesterday I created a trial account and tried out AWS.

To make sure I didn't get billed for anything I created a free tier account and made sure I only selected free tier services and didn't select any service that had any charges specified. Also I created a billing alert to get notified of charges as soon as they were over 0,00.

I tested for a couple of hours with EC2 and RDS. And afterwards I deleted all instances. And at that time no charges were specified under billing. The region was set to EU (Ireland) / eu-west-1a.

Today I received a billing alert notifying me that I have been charged $12.65 (+$ 2.66 VAT) for the RDS service:
$4.215 per RDS High Memory R3 Eight Extra Large Instance hour (or partial hour) running MySQL - BYOL 	3 Hrs 	$12.65

I am sure that when I created this instance, I chose only for Free Usage Tier services and selected no option at all that specified any costs or mentioned that they were outside of the Free Usage Tier.

My question to this forums:
 - Is this my mistake and if so, how could I have known I would be billed ?
 - How can I dispute these alledged costs?

I went and double checked. And while creating this instance, I specifically selected:

 - MySQL Community Edition

 - No (Use Provisioned IOPS)

C++ Development	"Re: unexpected billing
AWS billing is certainly a complicated topic. First of all, there is actually only one account type. When you sign up, you get a regular AWS account. Any usage covered by the free tier as outlined on http://aws.amazon.com/free/ end up as $0 on your bill. Usage exceeding or not covered by the free tier is charged. As AWS offers a wide range of services and tons of ways to configure things, it is unfortunately not that easy to know what is or isn't available under the free tier. Sure, the free tier page is very precise, but it can still be hard to know exactly how it relates to what you are doing in the Management Console.

For RDS, the free tier offers one (well, technically any number for a total of 750 hours per month) single-AZ micro database instance running MySQL, Oracle BYOL or SQL Server Express edition. A certain amount of storage, disk I/O, and backup is included. I definitely see how that ""production yes/no"" question can be misleading. And you can still shoot yourself in the foot by manually enabling Multi-AZ and/or PIOPS after answering no. The problem in this case was that you selected an instance type other than the micro.

In general, there are warnings here and there in the Management Console (perhaps mostly on the EC2 side), but in the end it is up to you to make sure that a certain configuration is in fact fully covered by the free tier. Not necessarily easy, so that's where billing alerts are useful. It's good to hear that you at least detected this quickly. I'm just a customer and can't speak for AWS, but they tend to be reasonable. You can reach billing and account support through https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/ - When you click through to billing/account inquiries, there is a form with an option to open a web ticket or discuss over the phone."
C++ Development	"Re: unexpected billing
I cannot recommend to try AWS for free. 
You don't know if you are getting charged. Billing alert is not default.

It is extremely difficult to know if you are trying or buying.

I signed up for a free trail -  I thought.  I received no warnings if usage is not covered by free charged and then I got charged for almost $200 without knowing what service I have used.

Don't expect help from support - they just refers to what is covered by free tier that is to me very complicated as I'm  novice to AWS services. 

Usually the reason for signing up to a free trail first is to get familiar with service before signing up for real - but this is not the case when using AWS - you have to understand everything before trying or else it will cost you.

Amazon CloudFront supports Geo Restriction, also known as Geo Blocking, which
prevents access to your content from specific geographic locations. When an end user

Hi,

I don't know what had happened on our RDS instance (m3.large, singapore), but update/insert speed is now 10-20 slower than usual since 3-Nov, and on the same day I had login problem to AWS too, I couldn't login until late of that day, but DB performance is now really bad.

""show processlist"" listed lots of ""Waiting for table level lock"" on update/insert statements, I know it is MyISAM table locking but it is almost same amount of rows before and after 3-Nov, same queries, same amount of concurrent connections, I never saw this problem before that day. So what caused update/insert slowed down suddenly?

On Dashboard monitoring, I saw huge spike on Freeable Memory, Queue Depth, Swap Usage, Write Latency since 3-Nov, compared with the status in the past 2 weeks. 

These spike seems to tell memory are not fully utilized since 3-Nov, and write to disk instead of memory.

I suspect there is hardware (memory) problem? Can any AWS staff help to check? Let me know if you need my account info.

You might want to check if this coincides with your instance maintenance window

Any instances that have not been updated by 28 October 2015 will be automatically upgraded during their next maintenance window between 28 October and 10 November 2015.

AWS finally responded, but it didn't really help.

They said it could be due to index key buffer cleared because of server / instance reboot. They suggested warming MyISAM key buffer. That's not the reason. key buffer reset may impact performance but it will recover / improve by itself over the time, while our case is, it is slower and slower every day.

Anyway I tried warming index key buffer as suggested, it didn't help indeed, after ran a test.

I noticed there are always lots of ""writing to net"" status for every query fired, I think that's the root cause, for some reasons MySQL is unable to send query result back to client and that blocks everything.

I made few tests manually, single process from one server.

1. started process, very long time ""writing to net""... 91 seconds...
2. stopped the process, started process immediately, no more ""writing to net"", now everything worked just like before 3-Nov
3. stopped the process, started process immediately, no more ""writing to net""
4. stopped the process, waited a while (1-2 mins), started process, very long time ""writing to net"" appeared again
5. stopped the process, started it again immediately, no more ""writing to net""...

Hello everyone,

I'm new to AWS, and I am loving it so far.

I'm starting small to get the hang of it, just using S3 + Cloudfront to serve some large static images on my website.

I've been doing some testing with Chrome's network console, and what I have found is Cloudfront can serve images the fastest, but it sometimes does not. So far, the best averages come from the static S3 URL.

Sample test image:
http://d79m47wqlyqsk.cloudfront.net/img/sd1.jpg
https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/arcv2/img/sd1.jpg

From my sample testing, Cloudfront can serve the ~500kb sample image anywhere between 300ms and 5000ms, quite the range(Hard reload and cache cleared on every reload). The static S3 link can serve the image anywhere from 600ms and 2000ms.

For me, the safer bet is obviously the static s3 url, but I would love to utlilize cloudfront's edge technology. Am I testing the wrong way, or am I looking at AWS the wrong way?

Thanks for the help"
C++ Development	"Re: Inconsistent performance from CloudFront?
I havent experienced this myself but i would guess it depends how you have cloudfront configured

as you will know cloudfront basically keeps caches of your data in edge nodes physically closer to you to speed up fetching the object. If therefore you happen to be relatively close to real data then i guess the performance will be ok anyway but how does it perform for someone the other side of the world, without cloudfront they would have to recall the real object from s3 which could take a relatively long amount of time.

Also are you taking into consideration your TTL settings, if your outside of the TTL of your cache then effectively you're not gaining anything as the real object is being fetched from s3 anyway.

Finally dont forget the cost, i dont know how many times you expect your objects to be accessed but cloudfront is cheaper per access than s3 IIRC"
C++ Development	"s3 vs Cloudfront?
I have static hosted files in an S3 bucket at the moment. These are very simple resources such as HTML/Javascript/CSS/Image/Font files. The files being served are typically very small so cost isn't an issue when considering Cloudfront as opposed to S3.

I am considering setting up the S3 bucket to use Cloudfront as I understand files will be delivered faster with less latency.

There will be occasions when I need to modify HTML/CSS/JS files after they have been distributed on the Cloudfront network so I have been reading about configuring the cache control. I'd like to have a short Max TTL so the content delivered is more ""dynamic"" with greater likelihood that recent modifications are migrated to the edge servers quickly.

I understand that the cache system works like this... When a request is made to Cloudfront (source has expired it's TTL), the nearest Edge server contacts the origin to check if the source is modified. If it isn't then just serve up the local Edge copy to the browser.

I was thinking to set a TLL of 5mins for HTML/CSS/JS files and others at the default TTL. Would there be any drawbacks, considering that everyone accessing the pages would only be on WiFi? I'm thinking that a forced refresh every 5mins would be acceptable for a wifi landing page. What would be the recommended setting to use in my situation?

Any comments would be appeciated."
C++ Development	"Re: s3 vs Cloudfront?
You def should think about using cloudfront

Personally i think you need to think more about how often this needs to be refreshed, is it really a problem if you dont get the latest version straight away? the point of cache is speed an convienience and if you need to hit the real files 80% of the time whats the point. You say ""There will be occasions when I need to modify ...."" if these aren't multiple times everyday then i would leave the ttl as long as you can.

What we do here is manually invalidate the cloudfront distribution as the files are updated, we have a s3 post a notification to a lambda function whenever a file is updated eg changed css. This event contains enough information that we can invoke a manual invalidation of the object in the cloudfront domain. This means we can have 24 cache but if the file changes we force a refresh within 15 mins

Go through Amazon help on SSH connection setup. It should be very easy if you have past experience with it but might be frustrating for a first time users. In general you just have to attach your .pem security certificate to encrypt SSH connection. Or you can use web browser...

C++ Development	"Re: Best hosting solution for high traffic news site
I would start with EC2 instance. It is highly scalable. You can increase it as your traffic grows. You can also use spot instances to speed up your site during business hours. 

If you grow enormously big, you can create few instances and connect other services like Load Balancer.

On the other hand the answer depends on technologies you are going to use. If your site would be the SPA, then I would add AWS S3 for site itself. Although you have to use AWS S3 anyway. This is the only place where you have to store all the files like news videos, pictures, ...

If you want your own CDN then you can use Cloud Front. This is service on top of S3.

C++ Development	"Need Advice: Looking to replace in-office server with AWS EC2
I have my first ec2 running perfectly for the last 3 months and very happy so far. We need to update our internal servers hardware and I am interested in just having it on AWS instead of managing it in-house.

What is this internal server?
1. fileserver for internal buisness docs, estimates, marketing materials, etc. (SAMBA)
2. Development Server. Websites, applications, etc are run here so multiple develoeprs can work on a single project at the same time. (LAMPP)
3. Backup server, all pcs in office backup to this server currently, but probably wont if we move to aws (SAMBA)

Why do I want to go to AWS?
1. every five years we update the hardware appox 1500.00 USD + approx 500 USD per year in maintenance, electric and hardware(sometimes).
2. In house VPN sucks! and works when it wants to so developers have to be in-house to get clear connection to server. Remotely working is possible but extremely slow at times.
3. the ability to have it run during office hours and ability to turn it on or off from anywhere (even when I am on vacation) would be nice .
4. I love the easy snapshots, which with a internal server backups, is copying files not the entire drive.

What I need.
1. secure, secure and yea lets see secure.
2. Ability to vpn to a network to access the server. (this is vitial)
3. Turnkey linkux ami, which I saw there is, that I can manage.
4. we have samba configured on our internal servers with folders and files that are shared and protected via samba. Will this same idea work in the AWS enviroment? Obviously I need to setup SAMBA on the ec2 / server. But once I am connected can I navigate say to a hostname or ip address to access the samba shares?
5. As I said above development server, lamp,  for web projects. What would be nice is ability to have a portal for clients to view these sites during the development process.
6. setup SVN for the development sites (I would like revision control for at least the larger projects)

I think thats it, any ideas are welcome and not sure if aws can help with all of my wish items. I may need to create 2 EC2 instances to accomplish all of my ideas. Last any articles / documentation (links) are greatly appreciated. 

Thanks!"

EC2 + other AWS services can certainly meet/exceed your requirements. Comments below...

What I need.
1. secure, secure and yea lets see secure.

The level of security of the environment/services will depend on how you configure/implement it but you'll be able to meet/exceed the security of your local hardware/environment via EC2. AWS even offers network based HSMs if you needed that.

2. Ability to vpn to a network to access the server. (this is vitial)
Yes, you'll be able to configure this via VPC (security for remote access the network space the resource(s) are in) and then stack the configuration of the resource(s) which would be accessed remotely. To start with check out..

VPC - http://aws.amazon.com/vpc/
Security Groups- http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html
Overall AWS security docs - http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_Network_and_Security.html

3. Turnkey linkux ami, which I saw there is, that I can manage.
It's likely there's already an AMI out there you can use as is, but if not, you can create your own from scratch or take an existing one, modify it, then save it as your own private AMI.

4. we have samba configured on our internal servers with folders and files that are shared and protected via samba. Will this same idea work in the AWS enviroment? Obviously I need to setup SAMBA on the ec2 / server. But once I am connected can I navigate say to a hostname or ip address to access the samba shares?
Yes, as long as your remote LAN has the ability to resolve and connect to your SAMBA resources on AWS. The way you did this would depend on how you configure remote access to the resources on AWS.

5. As I said above development server, lamp,  for web projects. What would be nice is ability to have a portal for clients to view these sites during the development process.

You can do this many ways - access controlled using the same methods/areas as your other AWS resources (VPC, security groups, IAM, etc).

6. setup SVN for the development sites (I would like revision control for at least the larger projects)

Doable as well.

I'd suggest you setup multiple EC2 instances for the different roles. I'd also strongly suggest you look into AWS Storage Gateway as that would likely allow you to drastically simplify your backup/storage strategy while making it more automated, easier to manage, lower cost and at the same time enhance the user experience."
C++ Development	"Re: Need Advice: Looking to replace in-office server with AWS EC2
Once you setup VPC you can just browse to the server on AWS by its internal IP address.
Definitely look into multiple EC2 instances for different roles. 
As of cost - you quoted like $2K a year for your current server. Serious Amazon instances cost $0.50 to $3.00 per hour (each). Let say you have a modern production EC2 server for $1.00 per hour.
Thats $720 per month just for running it, not include bandwidth and everything else...
Definitely will be more expensive than your current in-house hardware.
BUT: AWS is very easily scalable: vertical and horizontal. Need to add RAM and CPU or couple of terabytes of HDD space - can do it in a few clicks. And if you plan it carefully and strategically distribute your load between data regions then you can continue running even when whole country experience another blackout..."

Hi,

I am guessing you are currently using 1 host for your Java app that customers access and perhaps another host for the Database?


In its most simple form I would create an instance and install and configure your Java App
Create an AMI of this instance
Set up autoscaling of your instance to ensure 1 instance of that image remains operational at all times, using the AMI to scale out when needed or dependant on laod
Depending on traffic you could have 2 instances set up with an elastic load balancer set up in front of it and have these instances split between different Availability zones
For your PostGres DB I would utilise RDS which will autoscale to size should it be needed and initiate automatic backups
For high availability of the DB you could set up Multi AZ deployment should the primary fail
There are migrations steps you can take to extract data from your current DB and import into RDS


I would also take a look at something called Elastic Beanstalk as it could help you automate updates and deployment of your Java App.

I have an API I've created using Sails.js, like Rails but for node.js and Express. The API is hosted on a ubuntu EC2 instance. I've built an android application using ionic-framework/cordova/angular.js. 

If I serve the ionic application as a web site in my Chrome browser it makes the socket connection without issues and I could successfully make io.socket.get() request to my API which returned data from my relational database on AWS RDS.

I am a newbie to AWS. For some strange reasons, we have never succeeded in transplanting an Excel application over to AWS EC2 running on MS Office 2010. 

We have two locked workbooks, wbk1 and wbk2. Wbk1 is a read only executable file and it contains some addin and also a file opening macro which opens wbk2 and then it returns to close itself, leaving wbk2 opened for the user to use. Wbk2 has many application macros in it and it also has a file opening macro which checks for user ID and PW etc before it will open the workbook for the user. Wbk2 can be saved but not wbk1.

When deploying the workbooks on AWS EC2, the Excel will consistently hung any time before wbk2 is fully opened or while wbk2 is trying to save itself, which is part of a built-in mechanism to save the user ID immediately after the wbk2 is opened. In this situation, wbk1 never get closed as it would be the case when we run this application on any other desktop or laptop.

C++ Development	"New User - Videographer Looking To Live Stream Video What Am I Doing Here?
I am a freelance videographer and I am researching methods of live video streaming. I want to offer my clients, some of whom are entertainers and event promoters, the ability to stream events, and on-demand recordings, and also to control access to them. In other words, I need the flexibility to stream on my own Livestream platform or some other platform and have it be protected. The basic Livestream platform only supports fully public streams and recordings. 

I have a computer fully equipped to perform live streaming, but I have not set up the services associated with it (except for the Basic Livestream platform)

I have an Adobe Flash Live Media Encoder installed as part of the Livestream Studio desktop application for multi-camera productions. I also have a Teradek Vidiu - a camera-top unit that allows me to stream via WIFI or hard-wired internet on remote shoots without a computer. Finally, I also have a subscription to Adobe Creative Suites 2014. 

Two days ago, I streamed an event live for the first time using Livestream, and it was a success! However, it was mainly an experiment to test my equipment and the quality of the video stream. And because the stream was public, there was no way to charge the viewers for watching. Livestream does offer the services that I think I need to control access to my video streams - password protection, viewer login, pay-per-view, etc., but they charge a very high Enterprise level fee that is inaccessible to a lone operator like myself. So I am looking for alternatives. 

I also came across something called WOWZA, to which I have a trial account, but I know nothing about how to use.

The Adobe Live Flash website led me to Amazon, and here I am. I already had an Amazon.com account, so it was easy to create an AWS account. But I have no idea what I am doing here. I see all sorts of Amazon web and cloud services, but I seem to have lost any links or references to live media streaming, which I originally set out to do."
C++ Development	"Re: New User - Videographer Looking To Live Stream Video What Am I Doing Here?
Hi, looking at the AWS reference architecture material, it does seem that live streaming is doable, with or without a paywall (using AWS devpay), and a combination of Cloudfront, EC2 and S3.  I would probably be inclined to set this up using an all-in-the-cloud approach rather than hosting the content on your own computer, but that's a decision that's subject to a few bits of other information and detail, I think.

For what it's worth, while I have years of experience with technology and solutions architecture, I'm not as strong with AWS and this is something I need to rectify, so I'm interested in trying to help you design this, if that would assist you?

C++ Development	"From Adroll: DNS-less setup in AWS
Anybody that has worked with AWS must deal with the arbitrary hostnames that AWS generates for each instance. These names are difficult to remember and not particularly useful to understand what tasks any particular node is assigned to.

The classic solution to this problem is to use a DNS server, but unfortunately setting up and maintaining a DNS system can be a pain and, when you are a quickly moving startup, it’s a lot easier to spend your time maintaining only the bare necessities. Of course eventually you’ll need a proper setup, but until then, there are plenty of work arounds that do their job until you’re big enough to have more time to refine your infrastructure.

Setting up a Private DNS is not a simple task. Using Amazon Route53 could be an option, but it doesn’t manage private ip addresses any differently so, unless you want to leak your private addresses to the outside world, you’ll have to set up your own DNS. In addition to all of this, although there are many options for cheap private DNS service, nothing is cheaper than free.

Usually you live through this by setting up entries in the /etc/hosts file but a great advantage of the cloud is that instances come up and go down and scale up and down. Manually changing all of the /etc/hosts or pre-configuring them is hard and time consuming, and worst of all it’s hard to change in case of failures.

We’ve tried to work around the immediate necessity for a DNS server while still obtaining all of its benefits by using tags in AWS. The system works in two parts: on one side you set tags like dns: HOSTNAME on every machine that you want to reach with a simple hostname, on the other side you need a simple script that can build a /etc/hosts file by using the information obtained from the EC2 Tags service.

C++ Development	"Re: DNS-less setup in AWS
I use more easier way.

Just use route53.  Make an CNAME entry.   instanc1.yourdomain.com

Created a script with AWS API/BOTO. That everytime i boot the instance the script runs and it updates that CNAME record with the its endpoint as value.

So you dont have to remember any domains. It gets updated every time you reboot."
C++ Development	"Re: DNS-less setup in AWS
That's definitely a valid approach, as I mention in the article, but you'll risk leaking your internal structure to the outside world and exposing your internal machines to DNS attacks on the public DNS side.

This is why most companies rely on a private DNS to manage this problem."

I can see there was a lot of ingenuity in your solution, but in general I just don't get why you wouldn't go with a DNS provider.  I learned a long time ago, DNS is a special art. As much as it might seem simple it is really really not and performance suffers when an amateur plays with it. I set up two DNS servers once for a special case, once, and I would never do it again.  Plus it doesn't cost that much and you can get good expert support. The two companies I have used in the past with great effect are easydns and ultradns, it is really worth the extra account/bill.  There are lots of others to choose from, those are just two that also provide ANYCAST support, which for my use cases, globally, is a strong requirement."

C++ Development	"AWS billing is closing our startup down- won't give us 5 days grace
We've been a long running startup built on AWS from the ground up (yes we drank the juice).

As advertized, AWS has been a hugely successful platform for us, from RDS, beanstalk, S3 and now SES. We've been able to build a community of over 800,000 homeseekers using our SASS and host thousands of websites for real estate firms large and small......however,

Last month we ran into a cash flow challenge when our merchant processing got stuck (nothing to do with Amazon payments) and we requested a 14 day grace period from 'suspension'. Amazon support got us to the right folks and they said sure, no problem, and ask if we'd need some additional time for the October due date.

We replied uncertain, as probably not. Our account is not huge, and certainly not big in an 'Amazon' sense, but we have sent over $63,000 to AWS since inception. 

Today we realized our $952 invoice couldn't be practically paid until the 4th or 5th day into November, so we replied in our ticket that we could use the extra time this week as well.

Joshua in accounts was polite, but informed us that the 14 day grace from last month was a 'one time event and would not be repeated'. 

We informed him that its lights out if we get an administrative outage, as all our users, and certainly paying accounts would leave. I went on to ask why AWS, being a B2B company, wouldn't offer some cursory interest charges as other USA firms, indeed firms worldwide, extend trade terms to keep business running. While our local banks are not into tech lending, we certainly expected AWS, building upon noted startups, would give us a few extra days to keep our business intact. 

That seems to not be the case now. Joshua replied that 'the policy at this time does not allow...'

Can anyone advise? I've look hard and long across the AWS TOS and everything, but seem unable to uncover any policy at all.

My advice for any other businesses that are considering growth and considering doing it on AWS, consider the impact if do to some snafu with your bank, funds are not available as planned, AWS may be more than happy to flush your initiative and possibly your employees (as we have) down the drain.

Thus the promised 'low costs' may end up being the ultimate price."

2. Process the file using several linux command-line programs, takes about 2.5 hours per file on c3.2xlarge.
3. The output files take about 2GB.

More info:
1. I have multiple input files, arriving at irregular intervals.
2. The input and output files can be stored on S3.
3. I have a pre-configured EC2 AMI with the binary programs and their supporting data.
4. This is not a Java/HADOOP/Map-reduce program.
5. The input files can not be split into smaller chunks (for this specific program).

1. Start several On-Demands, and run it manually - easy, but cumbersome and expensive.
2. Write a scheduling framework to start spot-instances and queue the jobs (over SQS?) - complicated, and error-prone. Especially that Spot-Instances can be terminated before the 2.5 hours are done, and the work is wasted.

C++ Development	"Re: How to deploy a DAPP/smart contract to an ethereum network?
Hey there,

I was struggling with this yesterday and I made a small discovery that would make your life a lot easier. 

When you are setting up the Blockchain you have a section called Ethereum options that gives you a set of three addresses that are comma separated to start with. Chuck in your metamask public address and now that address is supplied with a good chunk of ether.

Once it has been created you take the RPC URL and connect to that network through metamask. This might require you to set up the SOCKS proxy on your own network in mac/win (Currently trying to get an API to work through which we can connect with keys). If it is all working well and swell you should now see that your address has the supplied ETH in that network. Mine sure does!

With this setup you can now deploy through remix by using your web injected metamask client. And transfer all the ETH from your account to any other accounts if required. 

Hope this helps a bit."

C++ Development	"Feasibility of using blockchain technology
Hi

I'm investigating the feasibility of using blockchain technology in a proposed real-estate-rentals web application. Major features of the application are (a) the vetting of tenants based on rental-payment and credit history; and (b) the management of financial transactions between tenants/agents and agents/landlords. My understanding is that blockchain technology is suitable for applications in which there is a lack of a central arbiter of transactions. In a web application such as the rentals one I've described, there will be a central arbiter in the form of the application's business tier and relational database. Whereas blockchain solutions tend to be used in decentralised systems, most web applications are centralised, aren't they?

I have two questions. Is there a case for using blockchain technology in the scenario I've described? If so, what aspects of the application would be suitable, and why would this approach be superior to handling the aspects centrally?

Hello,

I'm seeking advice regarding the recommended AWS facilities to use for my scenario.
Any feedback will be appreciated.

The need:
1. Given an input file, size ~80MB
2. Process the file using several linux command-line programs, takes about 2.5 hours per file on c3.2xlarge.
3. The output files take about 2GB.

More info:
1. I have multiple input files, arriving at irregular intervals.
2. The input and output files can be stored on S3.
3. I have a pre-configured EC2 AMI with the binary programs and their supporting data.
4. This is not a Java/HADOOP/Map-reduce program.
5. The input files can not be split into smaller chunks (for this specific program).

Few approaches I've considered:
1. Start several On-Demands, and run it manually - easy, but cumbersome and expensive.
2. Write a scheduling framework to start spot-instances and queue the jobs (over SQS?) - complicated, and error-prone. Especially that Spot-Instances can be terminated before the 2.5 hours are done, and the work is wasted.

But there's got to be an easier way...

I am able to access it locally on instance, but when I tried to access it outside of AWS instance lets say from my home computer using AWS public DNS / public IP address/ Elastic IP address of the instance, it gives me ""Web page is not available"".

I have gone through so many similar questions in this forum and i think i have done all the setting they are asking to do, but still no success.

Here is what I have done/confirmed. 1. localhost works, so application listens on port 80. 2. added inbound rule for HTTP on port 80 for everyone under the security group that my instance is using. 3. checked firewall setting on windows instance, made sure port 80 is not blocked. 4. tried even with turn off firewall, but no success.

I would really appreciate if some one can help me on this.

Hello All - 

I am an entrepreneur (+20 years, nine start-ups, seven exits, $5B USD in aggregate returned to shareholders) who is coming out of hibernation after five years to launch my next start-up. 

I AM GOING TO NEED A LOT OF HELP!

I have decided to develop the demo / beta version of my Digital Fitness Platform (DFP) myself (I have not written a single line of code for more than a decade) and to bootstrap this business it is running profitably.

I would appreciate assistance from anyone willing to lend a hand.

OVERVIEW

I am building a dynamic web application
The goal of the application is to enable people to unlock human potential via fitness
The core of the application will be a global fitness community
The application will connect many types of fitness
The application will eventually be distributed across a variety of digital channels


I plan to use AWS and Dreamweaver to build the demo / beta.

C++ Development	"Re: SQS Signature mismatch
Also worth noting my access to s3 and dynamo still works, and that while the error mentions checking my secret key is correct (it appears to be and is shared with the other service calls that work) the primary issue seems to be calculating the hash for the Canonical String that is inserted into the String to Sign. The fact that I get a different hash in my String to Sign to the one in the error report is very puzzling (especially when my result matches the online calculator's result).

When I hash the example at the end of the documentation:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4-create-canonical-request.html  I get the expected result."
C++ Development	"Re: SQS Signature mismatch
Worked something out. When the create started failing there were some discrepencies between what I was being told my canonical string should have been and what I had. Before posting I fixed those differences.

One of them was that the query string should encode & as &. Reverting that change actually fixed the signing issue."

C++ Development	"undefined reference to function when several .c and .h files used in a proj
Hello.
I have been working for a while now on my project, a RTOS in C.
I decided to use Cloud9 for its collaboration option.
I have learned that Cloud9 doesn't 100% support C but it seems to work okay, not too happy with the debugger updating/resetting every line of code you go through to have to open all the lists each time...not the current issue!

I ran into a problem that makes me unable to run or debug any of my files lately and I cannot find the solution.

I have several .h files with the corresponding .c files, for example:
kernel.h
double_linked_list.h
double_linked_list.c
timing_functions.h
timing_functions.c
context.c

When I have my main() in double_linked_list.c everything works fine, as expected.
I then went ahead and moved my main() to context.c and things broke.
Basically the context.c looks like:
#include    ""kernel.h""
#include    ""double_linked_list.h""
#include    ""task_administration.h""
#include    ""timing_functions.h""
#include    ""inter_process_communication.h""
 
int main(){
    printf(""Hello, lets try this out.\n"");
    list* timerlist = allocateList();
 
    return 0;
}

And all I get is 
Running /home/ec2-user/environment/DST2Project/Project/context.c
/tmp/cciOTWVf.o: In function `main':
context.c:(.text+0x18): undefined reference to `allocateList'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status


EDIT:
When I am able to run smaller projects, and use debugger I always get this error at the end:
""Could not open file: /lib64/libc.so.6""
Why?
How to fix?
Feel like my whole environment is perhaps set up in a faulty way?
Would be most greatful if someone could help me set things up properly to avoid annoying problems like this when all I want to do is write some code and debug it

C++ Development	"DNS queries using 'getaddrinfo()' on AWS Lambda
Hi,

I have been trying to run an 'svn+ssh' client on AWS Lambda. Where I got so far:
1) I obtained binaries 'svn' and 'ssh' plus their '.so' dependencies from an EC2 instance matching the Lambda environment.
2) I patched the 'svn' and 'ssh' executables with 'patchelf' to use the 'ld-linux-x86-64.so.2' obtained from EC2. This was necessary to avoid SIGSEGV termination.
3) At this point, I can use 'svn' to connect to HTTP/HTTPS repos on Lambda. But 'svn+ssh' fails due to 'ssh' attempting a call to 'seteuid()' for which no permission is granted.
4) I download OpenSSH's source, remove the fatal errors caused by 'seteuid()' calls, recompile, and repatch the ELF. Now an error indicates that the host name for the target repo cannot be resolved.

After some digging, I realized that there seems to be an issue with the execution of libc's function 'getaddrinfo()' on Lambda. Having a simple C program like this spawned from a NodeJS app and executed on AWS Lambda returns an error when resolving any external public host.

struct addrinfo hints;                                                   
struct addrinfo *res;                                                    
memset(&hints, 0, sizeof hints);                                         
int err = getaddrinfo(""github.com"", ""22"", &hints, &res);


Function 'getaddrinfo()' returns with code -11 (EAI_SYSTEM), and 'errno' set to 16 (Device or resource busy). Interestingly, attempting to resolve a host using alternative call 'gethostbyname()' works without problems, which suggest no network issue. Any ideas about how to solve this?

Thanks a lot in advance.

C++ Development	"Re: DNS queries using 'getaddrinfo()' on AWS Lambda
It's interesting that I found an answer short after posting the question, after debugging for so long. It turns out that from all dynamic dependencies that ""ssh"" uses, ""libnss_dns.so.2"" was not listed by command ""ldd"". Probably the reason is that this dependency is hardcoded with a ""dlopen()"" call in libc, or similar.
This caused the ""ssh"" binary (and my little test binary shown above) to load the ""libnss_dns.so.2"" available in AWS Lambda, as opposed to the compatible version from the machine where 'ssh' was compiled. Adding this additional library in the package solved the problem.

I've got a problem with the Core and S3 libraries and static linking of x64 Windows that I can reproduce in a small console application in Visual Studio 2017 v15.8.4. 

With the 1.4 libraries (exact versions below), both the x86 and x64 versions of my program link fine with the linkage of AWSSDKCPP-Core and AWSSDKCPP-S3 set to static. If I update to 1.5 or 1.6, the exact same project links fine in x86, but in x64 has the link error:

I don't know why it thinks the RuntimeLibrary value for aws-cpp-sdk-s3.lib is Dynamic when I have it set to static and it linked in previous versions (and in x86 with the same version). Could the x64 static libraries in 1.5/1.6 have a dependency that they're not supposed to have? Is there a workaround?

C++ Development	"Put json document to DynamoDB
Hello,

i want to store my json document into dynamoDB using C++ SDK.
My table is made of primary key ""eui"" of type string and a sort key ""time"" of type Number

Now here's my json document template:
{
  ""eui"" : ""Hello world"",
  ""time"" : 1535416565,
  ""name"" : ""john"",
  ""second name"" : ""garfield"",
  ""childrens"" : 5
}

I don't understand how to put this document into the PutItemRequest object.
The code example adapted to my case would be :
Aws::DynamoDB::Model::PutItemRequest pir;
pir.SetTableName(table);
Aws::DynamoDB::Model::AttributeValue av;
Aws::String eui = ""Hello World"";
av.SetS(eui);
pir.AddItem(""eui"", av);
....
I don't know what to do next, how to set my ""time"" in the pir object, and what about the other members of my original document.
Do i need to completely parse my json document and rewrite it in the dynamoDB syntax, or does any helper function already exists, or maybe am i totally wrong ?

thanks"
C++ Development	"asynchronous http request?
Is there a way in the AWS C++ SDK to asynchronously make http request?
Something like Aws::Http::HttpClient::MakeRequestAsync?
If not - how can I make async requests (passing a callback, etc)?"
C++ Development	"Re: asynchronous http request?
I'm not sure if your'e asking about making async request in general or you're interested only in AWS SDK.

If you're interested in generic C/C++ async HTTP request, there is lib_rest_req() function in Silgy's silgy_lib you can look at:

https://github.com/silgy/silgy/blob/master/lib/silgy_lib.c

To be able to properly handle timeouts and HTTPS, it's quite a piece of code. It's wrapped by CALL_REST macro:

C++ Development	"Upload file to S3 signed url
Hi,

I am developing a C++ REST API using the AWS C++ SDK. It sits on top of my API Gateway.
During a typical work flow, I need to upload files to S3. I know that the C++ SDK has a lot of S3 utilities, but for some reasons I have to mimic my JavaScript API that uses a simple HTTP PUT request on a signed S3 URL.
Up to now, my C++ interface with Cognito user authentication and ApiGateway works fine, until the HTTP upload to S3.

I am using an Aws::Http::HttpClient client on a Windows 10 host, and here is what I am doing:

// configure http client
/*****************************/
Aws::Client::ClientConfiguration configuration;
configuration.scheme           = Aws::Http::Scheme::HTTPS;
configuration.region           = ""eu-central-1"";
configuration.connectTimeoutMs = 30000;
configuration.requestTimeoutMs = 30000;
 
auto http = Aws::Http::CreateHttpClient(configuration);
/*****************************/
 
 
// upload function
/*****************************/
bool uploadBlocking(const std::shared_ptr<Aws::Http::HttpClient> & http, const std::string & fileName, const std::string & url)
{
	auto request = Aws::Http::CreateHttpRequest(Aws::Http::URI(url.c_str()), Aws::Http::HttpMethod::HTTP_PUT, Aws::Utils::Stream::DefaultResponseStreamFactoryMethod);
 
	const auto payload = Aws::MakeShared<Aws::FStream>(""MyService"", fileName.c_str(), std::ios::in | std::ios::binary);
	request->SetContentType (""application/octet-stream"");  // file is binary data
	request->AddContentBody (payload);
 
	const auto response = http->MakeRequest(request);
	const auto code     = response->GetResponseCode();
 
	return (code == Aws::Http::HttpResponseCode::OK);
}
/*****************************/


Debugging the code, everything goes fine until the payload upload at the DoWriteData function in file aws-cpp-sdk-core/source/http/windows/WinHttpSyncHttpClient.cpp, which returns false, and I did not have the possibility to add a Win32 GetLastError() over there.
I know using S3 functions could bypass this problem, but please consider I have to use a simple HTTP PUT request.

The question is: what causes the failure of the payload upload (DoWriteData failure) ?

Thank you so much."
C++ Development	"Rekognition: invalid image encoding
Hi, I've been wondering if there is some problem in c++ sdk as in aws cli that prevents sending images as a blob in requests (for example SearchFacesByImage).

Every time I do that I get ""invalid image encoding"" response.
I tried encoding image using base64 command in linux then reading binary data as unsigned chars to Aws::Utils::ByteBuffer. Also tried use base64 encoder from SDK (HashingUtils) but it didn't worked either.

Image is valid, because the other option (using S3 object) works fine.

C++ Development	"Keepalive does not notice certificate has been revoked
Using the AWS C++ SDK, I have a client connected to the AWS IoT broker, with a keepalive of 30 seconds.

When I revoke the client's certificate using the IoT console, the previously connected client can continue to publish messages for ~5 minutes, before the MQTT disconnect callback is called. This seems like a very long time to me - is this designed this way, or is it a bug?

If the client sends no messages, it can sit for hours and do nothing until the next message is published. I would have thought that the keepalive should fail if there is no longer a valid certificate for the connection.

Please help me understand how the client can detect that the certificate is revoked (or at least that the connection is no longer valid), without having to attempt to publish a message."
C++ Development	"Self-contained simple web app on t2.micro instance in C++
Hi,

Some time ago I wrote a self-contained web application in C. In a couple of years it'd developed into the whole framework, I finally decided to open. The main features:


Asynchronous, non-blocking web server = ultra fast and light
Usual tasks are wrapped in macros, that gives simple, clean code
3 ^rd party independent -- does not require anything, apart from C (or C++) compiler


The whole source code is in 4 c/cpp files and 4 headers. There are just 3 essential macros to get started. Deployment means that you just take one executable and copy it to any other bare Linux computer and that's it.

I run two public web apps based on this framework and one locally on AIX. Both public are on EC2 t2.micro (I recently upgraded one of them to t2.small) and both live happily together with MySQL server in just 1GB of RAM.

Not everything is documented yet, but I hope there's enough to get started:

However, my function fails, with a NotFoundException via CloudFront. What does this mean, and what am I doing wrong?

In more detail, I construct an AddressConfiguration, and place it in an Aws::Map it with an Aws::String of the email address. I then construct a DefaultMessage and place it in a DirectMessageConfiguration.

C++ Development	"AWS SV4 incorrect Signature generation using C SDK
Hello Sir/Ma'am,
We are using STM32 Micro controller board and Eclipse IDE to make an HTTP POST/GET request. We are using API gateway and Lambda Function for the POST and GET requests on AWS. We are using this code https://github.com/manningt/aws-signature-iot which generates a curl request with Authentication headers and X-Amz-Date for GET/POST request. 

While making a GET request using the HMAC code the headers that are generated works well and gives the desired response. But while making a POST request the headers generated gives an error of """"message"":""The request signature we calculated does not match the signature you provided. Check your AWS Secret Access Key and signing method. Consult the service documentation for details."""" 

We are adding Content-Type, Content-Length and Payload in headers of POST request and everything is correct up-to String-To-Sign but the signature which is generated using the String-To-Sign and Signing-Key is incorrect. We cross-verified it with the Postman's generated Signature using the same X-Amz-Date(same timestamp) and both did not match. In case of GET request both the signature are exact same. Which clearly means that the signature generated for POST using the code in eclipse is incorrect. Please, assist us here because we have tried all the possible ways and nothing worked. Looking forward to your response.

Thanking you.

C++ Development	"How to determine the region of a bucket?
Hi, I'm new here, so please be patient with me!

I'm trying to list the contents of a bucket, but to do so it seems I must specify its region. I thought the whole point of the cloud was that you didn't need to know where things happened, so this surprised me. In my test case, I do actually know the region, but I don't want to hard code a solution involving assigning it to ClientConfiguration::region and passing that to the S3Client constructor.

I've tried appending ""region = us-east-2"" to my ""credentials"" file and creating a ""config"" file with the same information, but both of those seem to be ignored by the CredentialsProvider.  Given the name of a bucket, does the C++ SDK provide a method to find its region?  I've tried the following, but the assertion fails:

Aws::S3::Model::GetBucketLocationRequest locationRequest;
locationRequest.SetBucket(bucket.GetName());
auto locationOutcome = s3_client.GetBucketLocation(locationRequest);
_ASSERT(locationOutcome.IsSuccess());
auto location = locationOutcome.GetResult().GetLocationConstraint();

It seems odd that it's possible to list the buckets for an account, without knowing their location, but not their contents.

I've found a crude way to determine the location of a bucket by creating a S3Client with all defaults, then calling its ListObjects member for the bucket and parsing the returned error message, which will be something like this:

ListObjectsRequest error: AuthorizationHeaderMalformed - Unable to parse ExceptionName: AuthorizationHeaderMalformed Message: The authorization header is malformed; the region 'us-east-1' is wrong; expecting 'us-east-2'

Is there really no better way?"

C++ Development	"Updating an S3 Cloud Object
Hello Forum,
I have been investigating the AWS C++ SDK and am struggling to see how to update an existing S3  object.  Assume I upload a 100MB file and 20 bytes change in that file - I'd prefer not to have to upload the entire file again.

I was looking at the S3Client::UploadPartCopy(...) API as a way of achieving the partial update.  Essentially I'd do the following:
a) Initiate the multi-part upload using S3Client::CreateMultipartUpload() and retain the returned 'UploadID'.
b) Copy 'N' unchanged parts from the original file using the S3Client::UploadPartCopy(..) API and its associated request.  In the request we set source and destination objects, byte ranges (etc.) and we store the ETags from the responses.
c) Copy 'M' changed parts from the locally modified file to S3 using the S3Client::UploadPart(..) API using the appropriate 'part number' and 'UploadID'
d) Complete the copy using the S3Client::CompleteMultipartUpload() API populating the request with the appropriate ETags and part numbers.

Now on paper this all seemed feasible, that was till I tried it and it failed.  Looking into the API documentation further it seems that the UploadPartCopyRequest::SetCopySourceRange() only works if the source object is > 5GB (see https://sdk.amazonaws.com/cpp/api/LATEST/class_aws_1_1_s3_1_1_model_1_1_upload_part_copy_request.html#ac5410f0f18e77605280c3fa12bd7d0a8)

This seems therefore that it's not possible to do a partial update to an S3 object unless the object is > 5GB.  This seems somewhat odd and so I'm beginning to doubt my approach - Am I missing something?  I'd appreciate any advice on how to partially update an S3 object and/or whether my understanding above is correct or not.

Thanks,
DD"

The device received the desired state on the ""shadow/update/delta"" topic.But mostly I received the following error message.
""Old Delta Message received - Ignoring rx: 73427 local: 73427""
Which results in a delay in delta notification. 
I found that the bug is caused by receiving two separate messages ""update /accept and update/delta"" with the same version number.

I think the solution is either AWS IoT server shall increment the shadowJsonVersionNum for update/delta, Or SDK shall use the separate version number for shadow/update/delta.
