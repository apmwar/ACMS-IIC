Alexa Web Information Service	"Increasing API Throttling Limit
Is there any way to increase the throttling limit for the AWIS API?"
Alexa Web Information Service	"Upgrading to v4 - Totally Lost
I've been using alexa web info service on my website for some 12 years now. Which is to say, I initially set up the service 12 years ago  

Today I got the mail that v2 is being shut down and I have to move to v4 apis. Super.

There was a link to some sample code in that email. But it appears that the sample PHP code linked-to is still v2 code? 

Also when I log in to the web services console, I can't even find Alexa Web Info Service in the list of services. The whole amazon web services system is so confusing and disorganized. I know I still use AWIS. My lookup tool still works and it shows up in my billing info. But that's all I can see. 

Is it hiding in plain sight? I cant find any info on what i actually need to do to upgrade my API calls here. There's also a link to alexa.com but I'm unable to log in to that site. 

And of course I can't reply to this amazon email to ask ""WTF?"""
Alexa Web Information Service	"Re: Upgrading to v4 - Totally Lost
Hi,

  I apologize for the inconvenience, however we've been sending notifications about V4 migration since late 2017.

You can find the V4 sample code here:
https://aws.amazon.com/awis/getting-started/#awis_sample_code

If you need further assistance that would require troubleshooting your code changes or other information that is not appropriate to publish in this open forum, please open a support ticket at https://alexa.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new if you have specific questions regarding your account.

Note that before you can submit a request you will need an alexa.com account. If you don't have one, you can register here http://www.alexa.com/register

Regards,
Francisco"
Alexa Web Information Service	"Re: Upgrading to v4 - Totally Lost
The sample code you just sent me appears to be v2 code, not v4 code (for PHP). Can you confirm this? 

Also are you saying i need to sign up for an account on alexa.com even though I'm already up and running on an existing amazon account?"
Alexa Web Information Service	"Re: Upgrading to v4 - Totally Lost
Hi John,

I checked the sample code, and it's SigV4. However I found out there is an un-used variable ($SigVersion = '2' which is confusing and I'll remove it. But it can't be safely ignored.

Regarding the need to open an account on alexa.com, it is only if you need to create a support ticket should you need specific assistance with your code. We understand the migration can be troublesome for some customers and we can help to ease that migration if needed.

Regards,
Francisco"

You know what would be really helpful? A procedural-style PHP sample script, in addition to the object-oriented-style PHP sample script. For those of us that don't really write OOP code. It's not easy trying to make heads or tails of that example script"
Alexa Web Information Service	"Re: Upgrading to v4 - Totally Lost
New question. The same code uses the following two values:

$ServiceEndpoint = ""awis.us-west-1.amazonaws.com""
$ServiceRegion = ""us-west-1""

I assume I'm probably supposed to change those to ""my"" server, but how do I know what values to use there?"

For anyone that is interested, I made a much simper, procedural, non-OOP PHP function for making these APIv4 calls:

Alexa Web Information Service	"Re: Upgrading to v4 - Totally Lost
Does anyone have a very basic (c# ideally - or Python) example of V4 running in a lambda? The AWS C# libraries don't have helper functions that I could find. I was able to setup IAM and write a python script that successfully brings back traffic results from AWIS. However, I want to create a lambda to call the traffic requests instead and take advantage of the lambda concurrency ability.

Also - I checked GitHub and StackOverflow already

Hi Tonybro,

You can access that data using the UrlInfo Response group in our AWIS API. More info is available in the technical documentation here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AlexaWebInfoService/latest/ApiReference_UrlInfoAction.html. You can also learn more about the API in general (pricing, getting started) here: https://aws.amazon.com/awis/.

Note that when using the data you must adhere to the AWS customer agreement and service terms here:

Hi Rich,

   Effective Feb 12, we have deprecated support for AWIS SigV2 on February 12, 2019.

Our code samples[1] and documentation[2] have been updated to reflect these changes. To access the API with SIGV4 signing, follow the documentation link and make slight code changes anywhere your applications make calls to the AWIS API. We strongly recommend creating an IAM user in your AWS account for this purpose.

If you have any questions or concerns about these changes, you have two options for contacting Alexa.com support:

1. If you have an Alexa.com account, please login to Alexa Help website[3] and submit a help request.
2. Post to the relevant AWIS[4] forum.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. Thank you for your continued use of Alexa's API and for helping us make this service more secure.

Do you have examples in c# of the whole process please? I am getting stuck with a response that says my 'String-to-Sign' is not being calculated properly.

I run a site that ranks food blogs using Alexa AWIS data.  For most sites, the data returned from the AWIS API is a reasonable match to the publicly available ranking data at https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo

However, there are a number of sites where the AWIS API data is wildly different (e.g. AWIS: rank is 1,511,535  and the same site at SiteInfo is 213,457)

Alexa Web Information Service	"Re: AWIS results from API differ from public SiteInfo
Hi,

There are some differences between the data returned by the AWIS API and the data shown in the Alexa Website. For example traffic rank differences are due to period each tool is using (the API returns daily Alexa traffic ranks, whereas the Global rank shown at the top of the Site Overview page is a 3 month rank).

In order to better address your question, could you provide a website and the metrics showing that pattern?

The data from AWIS for the same site, retrieved yesterday, have a global rank of 517,566 and Australian rank of 15,123. The links in count is the same at 357.

Another is madcreationshub.com.  Public siteinfo: Global 269,124, Australia: 3,675 Links in: 175
AWIS: Global 387,846 Australia 7,845 Links in: 136

This is not a once off or explained by differences in ranking periods - it seems that the data for some of the sites we track are always wrong (we grab statistics from AWIS once a day and we keep a history). For other sites, the data are a reasonable match.

I believe I found the problem.

The AWIS API docs specify that the URL passed to the UrlInfo action may be ""Any valid URL"". ( https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AlexaWebInfoService/latest/ApiReference_UrlInfoAction.html )

This appears to be incorrect.  The values returned for URL=""https://kidgredients.com.au"" are different to those returned for URL=""kidgredients.com.au"".  The second version is the one that returns values matching the public siteinfo data.

It seems the documentation is incorrect and the URL parameter should actually be specified as ""Any valid domain name"""

Hi,

  Certainly this is a bug, and we are looking into it. The documentation is correct and it should be returning the same data.

I'll update this thread when we found and fix the issue.

Alexa Web Information Service	"Re: AWIS results from API differ from public SiteInfo
Hi Francisco,

Just some further information:

The URL parameter is not only a domain/url issue, it is also sensitive to sub domains.  

e.g.  URL=madcreationshub.com  returns different data to URL=www.madcreationshub.com 

Calling urlInfo with URL=madcreationshub.com (without the www.) returns (what I presume is) the ""correct"" data (same as the public siteinfo), even though the site itself redirects request to ""madcreationshub.com"" to ""https://www.madcreationshub.com/"""
Alexa Web Information Service	"Re: AWIS results from API differ from public SiteInfo
One more interesting bit of info:

The URL parameter is not always sensitive to URL/domain/subdomain

For example, calling the API with URL=http://www.healthygfasian.com/ and URL=""healthygfasian.com"" return the same results and indeed as far as I can tell, for the majority of the sites I track, the results for a domain name are the same as the results for the site URL.

I'll see if I can get a more comprehensive list of sites on my list that are affected and maybe we'll see some commonality."
Alexa Web Information Service	"Re: AWIS results from API differ from public SiteInfo
As far as I can tell (so far), out of about 3,300 sites we track, only the following have discrepancies when the API is called differently with URL/domain/subdomain:

Alexa Web Information Service	"Re: AWIS results from API differ from public SiteInfo
I can't give you the exact request because the error occurs in the library I'm using ( https://www.npmjs.com/package/awis) and I can't easily show each actual request generated by the library.

I can tell you that the action is ""UrlInfo"" and the ResponseGroup is ""TrafficData,RankByCountry,LinksInCount""

I am trying to look up around 2,500 URLS, then do a lookup on the domain name only of each of those URLs and compare the results.  It begins to show errors after it's successfully processed about 4,800 of  the ~5,000 lookups.  So I know the library is generating correct request URIs.

As far as I can tell, the point at which the errors start is inconsistent, which seems to indicate it's not the request parameters that are the issue (the same process already worked 4,800 times) but the rate at which the requests are made."

I can use my own creds and the call works fine, but using the temporary creds from here https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html#credentials-explicit, the call is not allowed using the generated accessKey and secret.

Alexa Web Information Service	"Re: Using Temporary Credentials Do Not Work
Hi,

   You can use temporary credentials (for example from an instance role), however you need to provide the token also.

For example, from a bash script:
#!/bin/bash

credentials=$(curl --silent http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/YOUR_INSTANCE_ROLE)
accesskey=$(echo $credentials  |jq --raw-output '.AccessKeyId')
secretkey=$(echo $credentials|jq --raw-output '.SecretAccessKey')
token=$(echo $credentials|jq --raw-output '.Token')

Then, in the code you need to add the following header:
conn.setRequestProperty(""x-amz-security-token"", token);

Alexa Web Information Service	"AWIS UrlInfo List of All Response Group
Hi, based on the official api page - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AlexaWebInfoService/latest/ApiReference_UrlInfoAction.html

Does this list covers all the response group? I saw some other threads discussing about Alexa keywords, but it didn't shown in the docs (alexa website has this info). Was wondering whether keywords is removed or still available in the api as response group, as well as other possible response groups.

List of response group available in the docs included:
Categories, Rank, RankByCountry, UsageStats, AdultContent, Speed, Language, OwnedDomains, LinksInCount, SiteData

Let me know if other responses not listed like keywords is available, thanks a lot.

Hi,

  The list covered in the documentation is the currently supported options for the ResponseGroup parameter.

Alexa Web Information Service	"Re: AWIS UrlInfo List of All Response Group
Hi, really thanks for the reply. Regarding the supported response groups, I've tried ""keywords"" response group just now and it did show (this response group is not listed in the api documentation list), and there seems to more fields available like popups, etc. I tried on ""godaddy.com"" and keyword ""Domain Names"" returned.

1. Is it possible for Alexa support to list all the available response groups? I'm interested in others as well like search engine keywords, etc if available to be fetched together.

2. Secondly, since the response group I'm interested in the most is RankByCountry, is there any other ways I can request from Alexa support to get the ""O"" country as full list of countries (or at least lower percentage threshold under O)? I'm willing to pay extra or on custom price quotation solely for this RankByCountry full list response group if it is possible.

Otherwise I might have to fetch all sites under specific country and update the country alexa on specific website, which is neither efficient nor cost effective as a lot extra queries are required.

Thanks again for the time and help.

(addon: getting all alexa RankByCountry for all countries means a lot to us as i.e. godaddy.com has very high traffic, but the little 0.1% would means top 1000 ranking in country such as Malaysia, and the data is not shown in RankByCountry but just has the O for all other countries. Greatly appreciate if all countries ranks can be obtained with AWIS, thanks!)

Alexa Web Information Service	"TrafficHistory batch requests with multiple start dates
Hi,

The batch API for traffic history seems to have some problems since we switched to using an IAM user instead of the root account. This request returns an empty TrafficHistoryResponse element:

https://awis.amazonaws.com/api?Action=TrafficHistory&Shared.Range=31&Shared.ResponseGroup=History&Shared.Url=amazon.com&TrafficHistory.1.Start=20170322

If I move the URL into the batch group then this gives me a response but for the wrong start date:

https://awis.amazonaws.com/api?Action=TrafficHistory&Shared.Range=31&Shared.ResponseGroup=History&TrafficHistory.1.Start=20170322&TrafficHistory.1.Url=amazon.com

Alexa Web Information Service	"AWIS Pricing Enquiry
Hi,

Regarding alexa AWIS pricing:
Up to 1,000 requests/ month - Free
1,001 to 1,000,000 requests/ month - $0.00045 per request
Over 1,000,000 requests/ month - $0.00030 per request

What does it means for per request, does it means per url request, or per response request? i.e. if I get a website info of abcd.com and fetch all the possible response groups, vs get abcd.com with only alexa ranking as response group, are both charged the same and considered as 1 request?

Also, regarding alexa ATS pricing:
$0.0025 per URL returned
Why is the ATS pricing much more expensive than AWIS where 100 url returned for ATS is $0.25 where as AWIS is $0.045 (AWIS returned much more info than ATS).

Thanks a lot for the help."
Alexa Web Information Service	"Re: AWIS Pricing Enquiry
Hi,

  Regarding AWIS pricing, the ""per request"" refers to each individual API call. A single API call can include all the response groups and will be considered as one request for billing purposes.

ATS pricing is per site returned, so a single API call can include multiple sites and each one of them will be considered as a URL returned.

You are correct about the pricing differences. The main difference is that each AWIS request always returns information about a single site while a single ATS request can return information for multiple sites.

Don't hesitate to contact us again or open a support ticket at https://alexa.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new if you have specific questions regarding your account.

Alexa Web Information Service	"Re: Using .Net/C# to generate signature
I think the key is to do your URL encoding as follows:

    private static string URLEncode(string str) {
        //return System.Web.HttpUtility.UrlEncode(str).Replace(""+"", ""%20"");
        return HttpUtility.UrlEncode(HttpUtility.UrlPathEncode(str)); 
    }

Either of the lines will work.    If you just use HttpUtility.UrlEncode there can be plus signs remaining in the URL after encoding.      This is why so many people are reporting ""Not Authorized"" errors, I believe.    The error appears intermittently when plus signs are present in the URL.

Alexa Web Information Service	"Re: CategoryListings omitting results?
Hi Brian,

The ""Top"" category is actually ""Top/World/English"" which is why you see the gaps.  
And, a category such as ""Top/Home/Gardening""  is  really ""Top/World/English/Home/Gardening"".

You can get top sites in any particular language using the other languages categories under ""Top/World"".

If you want a global, or by-country top sites list, those are available from the Alexa Top Sites service.

We will update the documentation to make this more clear.

Alexa Web Information Service	"Where to enter keys in Java sample
Heads up: It´s the first time for me to have to do with codes. 

I downloaded the Java sample code for ""Alexa Web Information Service UrlInfo action.""

I use Netbeans 8.2 to Java (tested Hello World, runs perfect).

Now I try to figure out how I get the sample Java code running. 
1) Where do I need to enter the accessKeyId and secretAccessKey.
2) Also there is a 3rd variable ""site"". I suppose I need to enter the page I want the Url info on, for example ""yahoo.com""

3) The read me doc says, I need to sign up with ""http://aws.amazon.com/awis"". But when I try to open it and click on ""Get started with AWIS"", I am already signed in with my AWS credentials. Did both platforms migrate or do I miss out on something.

I appreciate all your help."
Alexa Web Information Service	"Re: Where to enter keys in Java sample
Hi,
   If you check the file UrlInfo.java in the sample code, the Access Key and secret are passed as  parameters to the command.

So once compiled, you'll execute it like this:
java UrlInfo ACCESS_KEY SECRET_KEY SITE

Where:
ACCESS_KEY/SECRET_KEY are the key/secret for the IAM user in your account configured to run AWIS 
SITE is a host name (like cnn.com) for which you want to get data from

The sample only has a simple usage of the API. For a complete list of all actions and parameters check the API Reference:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AlexaWebInfoService/latest/Actions.html

Regarding the third question, there is no need to signup for the service. You do need an AWS account and then you need to create an IAM user with a policy to allow use of the service.

You can find more information about that on the following links:
https://aws.amazon.com/awis/getting-started/#awis_sample_code
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AlexaWebInfoService/latest/MakingRequestsChapter.html

Hi, 

I need to fetch historical Rank data (Alexa Global Rank) of sites on the 1st day of each month for the last 5 months. I used TrafficHistory endpoint with the following optional parameters: 

Start value was the 1st day of the month
Range was 1


What I discovered is, global rank data for missing most of the time. Example scenario:

Site had a global rank in the middle of April (from UrlInfo endpoint) but TrafficHistory returned no Rank for the May 1st. The site also has a rank in the alexa.com/siteinfo endpoint now. 
Morevoer, sometimes XML data returned by the API is blank. 


In the TrafficHistory endpoint it's stated that ""The TrafficHistory action returns the daily Alexa Traffic Rank, Reach per Million Users, and Unique Page Views per Million Users for each day going back 4 years. Sites with a rank in excess of 1,000,000 are not included."" My understanding is that traffic data isn't captured if the Rank is over 1M. However, there are cases where the historical Alexa Rank is over 1M.

It'd be great to know whether the data is missing from the API or it's not captured. Is it the correct use of API for what I'm trying to achieve? Happy to elaborate more on this.

I'm having the same issue."

Hi,

I just tested your same code with my keys and worked fine. (Had to add <% and %> to your code)

I'm using php 5.6.30.

Even if your keys were incorrect you should be receiving an xml back with the error.

Could you send me the command line you are executing?

Thanks,
Francisco"
Alexa Web Information Service	"Re: response result is empty
I'm running it in Eclipse as is.  So I suppose 'php urlinfo.php' is the command line.  I'm using 5.6 as well.

It returns with an exception when I try to feed the xml into SimpleXMLElement.  The var_dump of the response is false.

I has a similar response when i tried the top sites api.

It felt like a security issue, but if it's supposed to return an xml in either case, I guess it's something else."
Alexa Web Information Service	"Re: response result is empty
Would it be possible for you to run from a shell?

The xml returned contains namespaces, so that could be causing problems.

It looks like it's an issue with php.  I was getting weird errors when i tried to run it in a shell.

When I run it in perl and java I get back a correct response.  Which is fine for me because I'm writing the new code in python 27.  I was just using php because I had that set up already and thought it worked ok.

I'm not sure how to fix the php error or even what it is.  I probably just need to remove and reinstall the whole thing."

Let me know if you need support for the python script. It's not in the sample code, but I've some V4 code that could help.

Hi,

 Since this seems to be a client side issue I'd recommend opening a support ticket at https://alexa.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new so we can better troubleshoot this issue.

Note that before you can submit a request you will need an alexa.com account. If you don't have one, you can register here http://www.alexa.com/register

Regards,

Alexa Web Information Service	"Re: response result is empty
Solution fo windows:

Because the serverhost ""awis.us-west-1.amazonaws.com"" using SSL, 

so we should just add the code ""curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false); "" before the code ""$result = curl_exec($ch);"", then it works !"
Alexa Web Information Service	"Re: response result is empty
Hi,

   I'd suggest checking your windows machine to make sure all root CA of the certificate are in the trusted root list.

I don't recommend setting the SSL certificate validation off, since it's more secure to let SSL certificates be verified to assert you are connecting to the right service.

You can get the list of root certificates from:
https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-prepare-for-aws-move-to-its-own-certificate-authority/

The certificate serials you should have installed are:
Amazon: 06 7F 94 57 85 87 E8 AC 77 DE B2 53 32 5B BC 99 8B 56 0D
Amazon Root CA1: 06 7F 94 4A 2A 27 CD F3 FA C2 AE 2B 01 F9 08 EE B9 C4 C6
Starfield Services Root Certificate Authority - G2

If the certificates are properly installed, you can open the following URL:
https://awis.amazonaws.com/api?Action=UrlInfo&ResponseGroup=Rank&Url=cnn.com

The page will return an XML saying the credentials are missing, however the SSL lock icon should be green in the browser.

If it's not, then something was not properly installed.

Hello,

I am trying to send a stream of single traffic history requests to the AWIS API. 

However, after a seemingly random number of successful requests, I keep receiving the same internal server error message as the one shown in a post on this forum from February (https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=272860&tstart=0).

Alexa Web Information Service	"SSL upgrade failed error
hi, when I was using AWIS api to query data in a corporate setting where a proxy server is used, I was having below error:

Error connecting to https://awis.amazonaws.com/api?Action=UrlInfo&ResponseGroup=Rank&Url=cnn.com. HTTP Status code: 500

I used another similar perl script to query data in an different environment where no proxy is needed and was able to get the correct response (so Access ID and key are working). The only difference between those two perl scripts (tested in two environment) is a line:
$user_agent->proxy('https','http://proxy.xyz.com:3128/')

can you tell me how can i get UrlInfo query work in an environment where proxy server exisits ?
thanks."
Alexa Web Information Service	"Re: SSL upgrade failed error
Hi,

   From the error and without knowing more about your proxy environment it seems that the proxy server doesn't have our certificate root CA installed as a trusted root authority.

As a test, I'd suggest modifying your script to use the -k option (to allow insecure SSL connections). If that works, then remove that change and contact the team managing the proxy environment and ask them to add our root CA to their trusted CA list.

Alexa Web Information Service	"How to get a URL by requesting specific aws:Rank?
Hello,

the API works great if I try to get data for specific URL:
https://awis.amazonaws.com/api?Action=TrafficHistory&Url=amazon.com

and the response will include this part (which is current Global Alexa Rank for given URL):
<aws:Rank>10</aws:Rank>

However, I need to do the opposite. I want to get a URL by requesting specific aws:Rank.

So, for example, request aws:Rank=10 and API will return ""amazon.com"", or request aws:Rank=2, and response will tell me it's ""youtube.com"".

Is it possible to do with API, and if yes, how? I have browsed through documentation and couldn't find the answer.

Thanks!"
Alexa Web Information Service	"Re: How to get a URL by requesting specific aws:Rank?
Hi,

You can use Alexa Top Sites (the Start parameter would be the Rank you want and Count=1):
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AlexaTopSites/latest/ApiReference_TopSitesAction.html

Then you can use Alexa Web Information Service API to get more information about the URL returned.

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Alexa Web Information Service	"trouble with AWIS subscription
I'm new to the AWIS service and was having trouble with running the sample API code.
I encountered the error code:
<![CDATA>
when I was trying to run UrlInfo. I closely followed the steps on the ""getting started"" page but on https://aws.amazon.com/awis/, there is no where to sign up for the service. There is a direct login to AWS but when I logged in to AWS, there is no where to subscribe to AWIS. 

Thanks,
Joe"
Alexa Web Information Service	"Re: trouble with AWIS subscription
Hi Joe,

We updated the signature process last December to AWS Auth V4, and there is no need to subscribe anymore.

To use the service you just need an AWS account and in that account an IAM user with a policy allowing calling of AWIS.

You can find detailed documentation about how to make requests here:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AlexaWebInfoService/latest/MakingRequestsChapter.html

And also sample code in php/perl/java/ruby here:
https://aws.amazon.com/code/?tag=code%23keywords%23awis

Please feel free to contact us if you need additional help.

Regards,
Francisco"
Alexa Web Information Service	"Re: trouble with AWIS subscription
Hi Francisco,
Thanks for the clarification, I'm running into error code: 
The AWS Access Key Id needs a subscription for the service
I wonder if this is due to me not creating IAM user correctly?

Thanks,
Joe"
Alexa Web Information Service	"Re: trouble with AWIS subscription
Hi Joe,

   Based on your error, what you are missing is the managed policy attached to the user you created.

The whole process is described in detail here:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AlexaWebInfoService/latest/MakingRequestsChapter.html

Let me know if you find any other problem.

Alexa Web Information Service	"Re: trouble with AWIS subscription
Hi Francisco,
I did closely follow the instructions, but I'm still having the same error while running the sample code. I also browsed through the forum and saw someone mentioning that only root users can use AWIS service. I wonder if this restriction applies in this case, or could it be problem with AWS account in general? 

Thanks,
Joe"
Alexa Web Information Service	"Re: trouble with AWIS subscription
Hi Joe,

   Root users were a requirement on the previous version. In AWS AuthV4 any IAM user can sign the request.

If you already follow the instructions on the link I sent, I'd recommend opening a support ticket at https://alexa.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new so we can better troubleshoot this issue.

Note that before you can submit a request you will need an alexa.com account. If you don't have one, you can register here http://www.alexa.com/register

Alexa Web Information Service	"awis http get request is taking way longer than before
Recently, we switched our awis http request in our code base to use IAM credential based on Amazon's requirement.
Everything works well except for the response time. 
i.e. GET on https://awis.amazonaws.com/api?Action=TrafficHistory&Range=31&ResponseGroup=History&Start=20171210&Url=facebook.com 
used to take about 150ms to finish.
After we switch to IAM credential. The same request take 1300ms which is slightly more than 1 second to process.
This is really annoy that the request taking way longer and our cost of running pipelines is increasing.

In aws document, I didn't see anything related to the request duration, response time, or latency time. The only useful information aws provided is batch request: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AlexaWebInfoService/latest/QueryBatchRequestFormat.html
I tested it as well, at a max we can support 5 sites in one request and the process time is 5500ms at average. 

Please let me know if you have seen this issue after switching to IAM. And how you solve it?"
Alexa Web Information Service	"Re: awis http get request is taking way longer than before
Hi Dean,

Thanks for reaching out. Our engineers are looking into the increase in response time for individual requests that you reported. We'll let you know here once we have an update. In the meantime we recommend using batch requests, as we have verified that batch requests are faster than 5 individual requests.

Cheers,
Debbie"
Alexa Web Information Service	"Re: awis http get request is taking way longer than before
Thank you, we will explore the batch request solution.
However, we are still looking forward to using the single request approach because of the simplicity of logging and etc.
And look forward to hearing some updates from your team.

Alexa Web Information Service	"Meaning of page view and reach
Hello,
I'm currently getting APIs by query below...

'Action=UrlInfo&ResponseGroup=TrafficData&Url=(some_url)'

and I'm wondering what exactly 'aws:Reach', 'aws:PageViews' means in TrafficData>UsageStatistics.
I first thought as 'Reach' is the number of accessed record, and 'PageView' is number of request, and looks like 'Reach' should be smaller than 'PageView' but all of record shows 'Reach' is much more bigger.

Could you explain exact meaning of this?

Thanks.

Hello,

Current description of documentation for TopSites is incorrect. In order to retrieve global list of top sites which is not bound to any country, one should not omit CountryCode and it shouldn't be an empty string as well. In order to make it work one could pass 'Global' as value of CountryCode, then there will be a list of top sites provided. 

Please correct the reference documentation, because now it is misleading. First of all, CountryCode is not optional parameter, it should be always present, otherwise there will be empty response. Also, with regards to global list this is how it is described now:
Valid country code (a list of country codes is available from ListCountries ResponseGroup). A global list of top sites is returned by default.
