Hi wilkaws,

Thanks for your interest in the T3a instances. We will offer them for customers in the near future. In the meantime, have you considered purchasing a convertible RI the existing T3 instance type?

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)	"m5a instances unreliable and repeated failures
Hi,

We have 2 M5a.2xlarge instances along with 8 m5.2xlarge instances. All of the 10 servers have identical role and configurations. However, we are seeing 1) unexplained bursty spikes (Cpu > 60-70%) and 2) instance failures that require a stop/start (status check failing and instances unreachable for 15-20 minutes) with the m5a.2x instances.

Since the load, role and configurations are almost same across the m5.2x and the m5a.2x and the m5.2x instances are performing well, we have no reason to believe that the issue is with our code/architecture.

Is there any known technical issue that is causing the m5a to fail frequently? Has anyone else been facing issues with the m5a instances?"

Hello Leo,

I have reviewed your instances and there is an issue at VPC level: the Network ACL is only allowing inbound connection on port 3306. You need to modify your NACL in order to permit your traffic also on the 22.

The X-Forwarded-Proto headers won't be chained by either ALB or the classic load balancer. However for X-Forwarded-For headers, they would get chained by the ALB.

X-Forwarded-For : a.b.c.d

When ALB would forward it to the backend, it would overwrite the X-Forwarded-Proto to HTTP, but it would append the client IP in X-Forwarded-For. Therefore it would look like this

This means that we have to push a private DNS server via OpenVPN to all end users. Our 172.x.x.x private network range has an AWS DNS server I push as primary and then I have a backup, that is never used, as 8.8.8.8. This allows all aws private internal resources to be access over the VPN without any issue from our end users, which primarily use MacOS and Tunnelblick. Everything to support this is on latest release versions and over 50 employees.

 When we started using RedShift, we noticed a weird issue. We reached out to PostgreSQL and even PG Client developers to see if their apps push a hard coded DNS for redshift hostnames, and they do not. This can be an AWS Network or DNS issue or a MacOS libc issue.

 When we try to connect from PostgreSQL client apps or command line in the terminal, the hostname is always resolving the external IP of redshift. RedShift has an external IP/access for specific IP whitelisted clients but 99% is forced over VPN and the private network. After the first fails to resolve, since its firewalled to disallow all external traffic in redshift, the second attempt instantly works and resolves using the internal IP set by AWS for redshift.

 Whats weird is that nslookup and other commands all resolve the hostname using the VPNs pushed 172.x.x.x AWS DNS server. Its only when we use PostgreSQL and Redshift that we ever face this issue. MySQL RDS, EC2 and other resources never have this issue.

 Can anyone help we rule out the issue as we cant figure this out?

Notice the failure notice and the IP used on the first attempt to connect to Redshift:

[anthony@Anthonys-Mini ~]$ psql 'postgresql://username:passwordhidden@redshifthidden.us-east-1.redshift.amazonaws.com:5439/dbname'
psql: could not connect to server: Operation timed out
	Is the server running on host ""redshifthidden.us-east-1.redshift.amazonaws.com"" (34.206.57.41) and accepting
	TCP/IP connections on port 5439?


Now notice how it works after the first attemp timesout and fails:

[anthony@Anthonys-Mini ~]$ psql 'postgresql://username:passwordhidden@redshifthidden.us-east-1.redshift.amazonaws.com:5439/dbname'
psql (9.4.1, server 8.0.2)
SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1, cipher: DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA, bits: 256, compression: off)
Type ""help"" for help.
 
dbname=#


Here is the DNS resolution as well:

[anthony@Anthonys-Mini ~]$ nslookup redshifthidden.us-east-1.redshift.amazonaws.com:
Server:		172.31.0.2
Address:	172.31.0.2#53

Hi, 

I am looking for a complete instruction for the installation of Magento 2 Porto theme into an instance in AWS lightsail VPC. 

I upload app and pub directories from Porto theme through SFTP / FillZilla to my AWS lightsail instance /home/bitnami directory, and then I move both app and pub folders from this /home/bitnami directory to the Magento application directory by using following SSH code :

sudo mv /home/bitnami/app /opt/bitnami/apps/magento/htdocs/app
and
sudo mv /home/bitnami/pub /opt/bitnami/apps/magento/htdocs/pub

sudo chown -R daemon:daemon /opt/bitnami/apps/magento/htdocs/app
and
sudo chown -R daemon:daemon /opt/bitnami/apps/magento/htdocs/pub

and then I move to magento application directory to effect magento command lines :

cd /opt/bitnami/apps/magento/htdocs/

sudo bin/magento-cli setup:upgrade

sudo bin/magento-cli setup:static-content-deploy -f

Hello, 

I hope this is posted in the correct location, sorry if not.

I have been creating a web site/ server on AWS Cloud 9.  I can code away for around 10 minuets and then I get disconnected and have to login again. Some times it takes at least 5-10 mins wait, but then again some times it's instant.... that I can log in again. If I delete my cookies I can instantly log back in again and work.

Hi, we got the following message:

EC2 has detected degradation of the underlying hardware hosting your Amazon EC2 instance (instance-ID: http://...) associated with your AWS account (AWS Account ID: http://...) in the eu-west-1 region.

Your instance will be stopped after the specified retirement date. You can start it again at any time after it’s stopped. Any data on local instance-store volumes will be lost when the instance is stopped or terminated.

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)	"ELB 504 timeout without any attempt to reach web servers
We are seeing strange intermittent 504 errors from our Application Load Balancer (ELBv2). When we look at the logs the upstream endpoints never received the request. The health checks show the 2 targets were up the entire time and we never drained. When we look in cloud watch, the load balancer shows 5xx errors but when we look at the target groups they show no 5xx errors. It seems the load balancer isn't even attempting to forward the request. This happens maybe 2-5 times per day.

Our load isn't spiking, it's very consistent throughout the day. CPU for the web-servers averages in the single digits."
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)	"Re: ELB 504 timeout without any attempt to reach web servers
This is ABSOLUTELY a real problem, and not just you. I've had an open support case with them for well over a week now about this. It took them a couple days to actually even accept that there might be an issue with the ELBs.

Just yesterday, they finally came back and admitted that one of our ELB nodes had been experiencing resource exhaustion and that their monitoring hadn't caught it. The ELB team is still investigating for a fix.

One of ways to really call this out to them and make them pay attention is to ask them to look at Cloudwatch graphs of  ""Per LB, per AZ Metrics"" and compare latencies of the ELB nodes across different availability zones. When you see that most of your nodes are fine, but just one single node suddenly has a huge latency spike that the others didn't experience, it's obvious that that node is having issues and it's not your backend servers.

Stay on them about this. It's the only way they'll address it. They prefer to act like it's the fault of backend servers, or that you are incompetent."
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)	"Re: ELB 504 timeout without any attempt to reach web servers
Thanks tfeak. We're seeing this again today. Random 504 errors with no traffic and both servers healthy and up- I can ping them directly. How are you following up with AWS? Do you have a thread open on this forum or do you have a support case open?
I never had this problem with the classic ELB but now that we're heavily using Websockets I really like the native WS support in ALB."
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)	"Re: ELB 504 timeout without any attempt to reach web servers
We experienced this same issue when trying to switch to using an application ELB. In our case about 40% of the traffic did not make it through. Switched back to a classic ELB and it works perfectly."

Same situation. Spurious 504 error codes returned by the ALB even when the load is pretty low."

We have the same situation. 504 Gateway Timeout returned by ALB.

We have the same problem when using ALB. We configured nginx as backend and ALB (with 60s idle timeout) for load balancing. However, when request to ALB, it's return 504  randomly when request time is about 10s.

Thanks,"
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)	"Re: ELB 504 timeout without any attempt to reach web servers
We have the same situation , and looking at the situation during the 504 errors they happens when the Target group contains one or more instances in draining state.
I think ALB needs some time to understand that an instance is not available. But this is not the right behaviour"

I followed advices DigaoParceiro from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5309910/https-setup-in-amazon-ec2
1. With Certificates Manager I uploaded SSL certificate from Comodo,
2. I created security group for load balancer and enabled http and https inbound
3. I created Load Balancer (I tried both classic and application), 
4. I added listeners for http 80 and https 443
5. I selected uploaded ssl cert for https
6 I selected created security group
7.  I associated load balancer with my instance of EC2 (Target)
8. Form my EC2 instance I enabled http and https
9. In Route 53 in hosted zone I set for myproject.com record A as an alias with value that I copied from load balancer DNS Name: myproject-com-76258999.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com 

What are results:
1. http://myproject.com and http://www.myproject.com work fine
2. http://myproject-com-76258999.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com works, https://myproject-com-76258999.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com also works (I got ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID - domain do not fit the cert, but when I proceeded, Icould see working website)
3. https://myproject.com , https://www.myproject.com - does not work. After some changes now I see here ""Amazon Linux AMI Test Page"" (welcome.conf page) like my apache was not configured. But on http://myproject.com I still see website correctly.

The forums are intended for technical questions. The engineers that monitor the forums are not overly familiar with billing specifics, however, even if you don't have paid support, you are able to open cases with customer service regarding billing-related questions, such as this one.

You can get to the support section by going to the console, clicking ""Support"" dropdown and selecting ""Support Center"". Then, you can click ""Create case"" and select ""Account and Billing Support"" as the radio button option.

Read more here: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-cost-explorer-update-access-to-ec2-usage-data/

Did you have any luck finding the source of the 'EC2-Other' section of your billing console?"
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)	"Re: Billing: EC2-Other
Hi,

My understanding is that Cost Explorer groups costs into high-level categories. (And there used to be just one category for EC2, until they split it into Instances, ELBs and Other).

For an extremely detailed breakdown of costs, go back to the billing dashboard and click on ""Bill Details"" on the right.

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)	"Re: Billing: EC2-Other
Yeah, the ""Bill Details"" button on the Dashboard page is where you'll want to go.  For me, EC2-other was EBS charges plus cost for an EIP not associated with a running instance.  I knew that the latter kind of thing will cause unexpected charges to start accruing, but I'd forgotten to free up the EIP, when I reached the point where I really no longer needed it."

Maybe too late, but hope still useful.

Hi,

I can see that there is an outstanding Abuse Report against your instance - i-b3991884. I can also see that you have restricted outbound UDP communication from your instance. 

I suggest you to review your instance throughly again for any signs of malwares and root kits. You can use tools like Chkrootkit, Rootkit Hunter etc for detecting malwares but please do understand that no tools can guarantee 100% detection. If your instance is compromised, the best to do is to rebuild your instance from scratch, copying the required files carefully. You can get information on how to work with chkrootkit to analyze rootkits on your instance here [1].

I can also see that you have replied to the Abuse team. They will review it and get back to you soon.

I understand your concern but let me convince you otherwise. It has been a practice to save on-premise data to other locations but in the cloud, especially in aws you are in good hands.

You can either do a manual backup via a bash script which will copy the data on your ec2 instance to an s3 and then connect from your on-premise server to download this copy

you can just forget about it. S3 gives you the durability of 99.999999999% saves your data across multiple availability zones and is designed for  99.99% availability which gives you the following:

We had that happen as well, on our c5 instance, i-0d9ce3c7c38454cf7,  on us-east-a1 with the ""Reset Attempt Failed"" at the end of the log;

Hello.

Problem: No matter what I set the time to, every reboot sets it back to UTC time BUT...keeps my correct time zone. Example: It's 1500 ET right now. If I reboot (which I just did), the time changes to 20:00 ET. So time zone right, TIME wrong. Why?

Current state of affairs described above: Is with chronyd AND ntp but NOT uninstalled.

Also, this file does not exist: /etc/sysconfig/clock

I think it might have been crashing my machine when I had it there. Is that possible or was it chronyd?

I tried using the instructions: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/set-time.html

I'm running this version of linux: RHEL-7.6_HVM_GA-20181017-x86_64-0-Hourly2-GP2 (ami-011b3ccf1bd6db744)

...to set my time on EC2, RHEL.... the instance locks up in X-hours. Meaning I can't all of a sudden SSH in....and have to ""reboot"" using the management GUI.

This is becoming a headache.  

It appears: As soon as I UNinstall the service chronyd...everything works again (no crashing) BUT ... my time is EST expect 5 hours ahead (time zone correct), which screws up everything.

Please advise. Thank you for your help.

Hi AWS team,

I have tried creating many new instances today of instance type t3.micro and t2.micro. Even after passing the system status check, I am not able to connect to the instances through SSH.

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)	"Re: Not able to connect to EC2 instance through SSH
If you want connect to an EC2 instance's public IP address directly using SSH, make sure you create the EC2 instance with a public IP address in a public subnet. If you're using the non-default VPC, make sure that the subnet is connected to an Internet Gateway in the VPC and the routing table has an entry to route traffic through the Internet Gateway. And make sure it's the correct routing table — I've sometimes accidentally created a new routing table instead of using the default routing table."
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)	"SSH Operation Timed Out
Hello, I've just started Amazon's free trial and have been following the set up guide,https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html#ec2-launch-instance,  in order to set up a t2.micro instance. I've been having difficulties connecting to it via SSH due to operation timeouts on my macbook.

I've gone through a large number of troubleshooting threads concerning this issue but have not been able to work out a solution. My apologies if some of my logic for the following troubleshooting does not make sense as I'm fairly new to this. Most of my troubleshooting were taken from points found on other troubleshooting threads of the same vein. I just tried piecing it together from there.

This is my output:
ssh: connect to host ec2-x-xx-xxx-xxx.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com port 22: Operation timed out


First thing I did was perform a tcptraceroute to see if I was even reaching the servers. My output:

I thought maybe there was some issue with the instance's security parameters but that didn't seem to be the case. The Ports and Protocal Fields are all set to 'All'. I've also tried connecting to the instance with my Firewall turned off but that didn't seem to be the case either. Furthermore, I have enabled Remote Login in my macbook sharing settings but that didn't seem to be the case as well. Lastly, I have tried connecting via my school's ISP, which my instructor used to demonstrate connecting to his server.

I'm a bit at a loss as to what my issue is. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

I have been building out an environment into AWS and am hoping you can answer some (hopefully basic!) questions to help me along.

1) I would like guidance as to how to configure DHCP options on my VPC 172.30.0.0/16. I have a domain controller on my Private subnet 172.30.1.0/24 which is used to provide DNS resolution to other domain joined instances. For that reason I have enabled DHCP Options Set on my VPC, pointing DNS resolution to the domain controller. I also have servers within the same VPC but in a Public subnet 172.30.2.0/24 that routes out to the internet via internet gateway. These instances are not domain joined, however as a result pick up the DNS settings that are set on the VPC. How can I arrange this so that only domain joined instances receive DNS settings from my domain controller, the other instances be handled by Amazons DNS? I am not sure how this possible with a single VPC?


2) On each of my windows instances I receive the error when trying to Get Windows Password:

Password not available yet.
Please wait at least 4 minutes after launching an instance before trying to retrieve the auto-generated password.

I wait for hours but this never changes.   I am unable to log in using the administrator password of the keypair, nor the domain credentials.  The console shows the server has fully booted.  This happens with instances in London and Ireland zones.   If I create a new basic instance, I am able to retrieve the windows password and login.  The instances are ones I create from an existing custom AMI, and I need to be able to build instances using N2WS backed up AMI images for DR purposes.

3) I want to restrict any connectivity of the public facing servers to the private ones, but allow private access to the internet for updates etc.  Is this best achieved using a NAT gateway from the private into the public subnet?  

4) I have a security group I built consisting of incoming ports required for AD.  Outbound is left default to any,  I apply that on my Domain Controller.  For a domain member server, do I need also apply that same security group for its 'incoming' AD ports or is it only necessary for the DC?
