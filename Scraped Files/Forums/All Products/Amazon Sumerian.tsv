Hi,

I want to make an Augmented Reality application using Sumerian. But having trouble about how to add a marker entity to the scene. I can only found some official tutorials about using Sumerian for Augmented Reality that uses ARCore & ARKit (markerless).

It depends on the use case.  Typically, in the behavior editor, you add an action labeled 'emit' and type a message.

If your emit message and listening message are the same, the target entity will be able to execute functions connected to the 'listen' node."

Are there any more modern formats than OBJ? OBJ doesn't seem to have units and any sense of direction, cause when I import it's rotated 90 degrees and is 10 times bigger than everything else.

How about something more modern? Isn't collada supposed to be a modern interchange format?"
Amazon Sumerian	"Re: Import Formats
Hi famadorian,
When importing an OBJ, you can drag the textures alongside the OBJ file so that they get imported at the same time.  FBX is also a common format for content creators, so you may explore some other tools besides ArchiCAD.  As for the scaling and rotation, I suggest you either investigate the unit scale (in Sumerian, we're at 1 unit = 1 meter).  You can either adjust this at the export step or simply adjust the Transform component to scale down to .1 and rotate 90 degrees."

Amazon Sumerian	"Re: VR Glitch
Hi ricebukett,

It appears that your scene has some very large assets that are causing issues with the graphics drivers on some of the devices you're trying to use.

• Your Default Pack contains several textures that are large and irregularly shaped, such as Autoshop Floor Lifts 02.jpg(5376 x 2688 resolution). They aren't being used in the scene, but they may be contributing to the autosave problem you're experiencing. Hovering over the Default Pack and clicking the broom icon to remove unused dependencies will delete these textures.
• Your ""shop design"" and ""Walls"" packs each contain a texture atlas called CubeSurface_Color (10,000 x 10,000 resolution). We recommend using texture sizes that are as small as possible. Textures above 2048 x 2048 resolution can cause crashes and unpredictable behavior on many platforms.
• The scene is rendering a total of 1.8 million triangles over 376 draw calls. We recommend limiting draw calls to 100-200 if you're targeting low-end mobile devices. Though we have no recommended limit for poly count 1.8 million is on the high end, so you may see better performance if you reduce the triangle density of your meshes.
• There are 12 lights in your scene. Reducing the number of lights will reduce the size of shader programs and may improve compatibility across platforms.

The origin point of the object may be offset from the object.

Hi,
i was trying to add an action in my behaviour to show/hide an entity.

Thanks!"
Amazon Sumerian	"Re: Show/Hide action
It depends on the use case.  Typically, in the behavior editor, you add an action labeled 'emit' and type a message.  Then in your target enity's behavior editor, you can use the action labeled 'listen' and type the same message.  If your emit message and listening message are the same, the target entity will be able to execute functions connected to the 'listen' node."

PavithraS,

Sorry to hear about that situation.  I'm not seeing this happen when I create a new scene and import a host.  Can you help me with the following:

1.  Are you still seeing this issue?

Amazon Sumerian	"Import Formats
Are there any more modern formats than OBJ? OBJ doesn't seem to have units and any sense of direction, cause when I import it's rotated 90 degrees and is 10 times bigger than everything else. Also, it's totally white, so no textures are included in the OBJ file; they're in a separate file. When I try to export to FBX from ArchiCAD, it crashes. 

How about something more modern? Isn't collada supposed to be a modern interchange format?"
Amazon Sumerian	"Re: Import Formats
Hi famadorian,
When importing an OBJ, you can drag the textures alongside the OBJ file so that they get imported at the same time.  FBX is also a common format for content creators, so you may explore some other tools besides ArchiCAD.  As for the scaling and rotation, I suggest you either investigate the unit scale (in Sumerian, we're at 1 unit = 1 meter).  You can either adjust this at the export step or simply adjust the Transform component to scale down to .1 and rotate 90 degrees."

We will dive deep into the auto save issue and give you an update."
Amazon Sumerian	"Re: VR Glitch
Hi ricebukett,

It appears that your scene has some very large assets that are causing issues with the graphics drivers on some of the devices you're trying to use.

• Your Default Pack contains several textures that are large and irregularly shaped, such as Autoshop Floor Lifts 02.jpg(5376 x 2688 resolution). They aren't being used in the scene, but they may be contributing to the autosave problem you're experiencing. Hovering over the Default Pack and clicking the broom icon to remove unused dependencies will delete these textures.
• Your ""shop design"" and ""Walls"" packs each contain a texture atlas called CubeSurface_Color (10,000 x 10,000 resolution). We recommend using texture sizes that are as small as possible. Textures above 2048 x 2048 resolution can cause crashes and unpredictable behavior on many platforms.
• The scene is rendering a total of 1.8 million triangles over 376 draw calls. We recommend limiting draw calls to 100-200 if you're targeting low-end mobile devices. Though we have no recommended limit for poly count 1.8 million is on the high end, so you may see better performance if you reduce the triangle density of your meshes.
• There are 12 lights in your scene. Reducing the number of lights will reduce the size of shader programs and may improve compatibility across platforms.

I worked along with the tutorial 'Using the Dialogue Component and Amazon Lex to Build a Chatbot' and performed every step diligently, but when I play the scene I always have my Start (On AWS SDK Ready) state highlighted and it doesn't move beyond that.

Amazon Sumerian	"Re: VR is stuck at Start (On AWS SDK Ready)
Hi TanG, the issue could be either from the Cognito Pool ID or the state machine - could you double check to make sure you're using a valid Cognito Pool ID? If you use another Cognito Pool ID, can the state machine action move onto the next state? Also, could you send us screenshots of your State Machine setup?"
Amazon Sumerian	"Colliders in ""Physics Part"" tutorial
For any reason I don't know, the colliders in the ""Physics Part"" tutorial are working differently to what I would expect, in my own test but also in the ""scene"" to illustrate the example at the beginning of the tutorial, in the document: 
https://docs.sumerian.amazonaws.com/tutorials/create/beginner/physics-part-1/

I would expect to see the ball gliding on the ground, exactly over the surface, but what I can see is the ball moving over an imaginary floor, parallel to the real one, some units below (in the Y direction). I can change this by increasing the Y half extend parameter (to somehing like 5 instead 0.5) of the floor, but then also with problems with the flippers. It doesn't seems the right solution.

I'm working with the last version of Firefox (61.0.01). I've tried to check it in IE Explorer 11 and Chrome, but without success.

Please, is a problem of my browser (given that the problem is also in the example at the beginning of the tutorial), or the parameters in the tutorial? something missing?any clue?

Amazon Sumerian	"Tap to record audio via Lex works in Sumerian not in mobile app
I'm having issues interacting with a 3D object on a mobile app using ARCore and AWS Sumerian. Even when tapping the object on the mobile app, the 3D object does not respond. My phone is on the compatible ARCore phone list.

I've built my AWS Sumerian host and published it which uses tap to record audio to elicit a response via Lex and Lambda which works fine within AWS. Basically, it's a modified version of this URL here. https://docs.sumerian.amazonaws.com/tutorials/create/intermediate/augmented-reality-using-sumerian-arcore/

I've used the sample ARCore code here via Android Studio.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40236925/allowing-microphone-accesspermission-in-webview-android-studio-java

It appears in another thread that tap to interact with existing objects should work by default for Unity and doesn't concern ARCore. I'm wondering whether this is the case for AWS Sumerian also?
