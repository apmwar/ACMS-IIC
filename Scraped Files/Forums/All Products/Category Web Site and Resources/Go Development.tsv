Go Development	"Keep alive message timeout
Today i was testing the publish message from AWS server to my device. What i found was that if the device connect to the AWS server and never send any communication message for about 5 minutes to the AWS server and send the message after 5 minutes from the AWS server then the device did not receive any messages.

Default keep alive message is set to every 10 minutes.  But interesting part is that the server send the message after receiving the keep alive message that send from the device.

If i set 5 minutes keep alive message then it is fine. Is there any particular reason?"
Go Development	"Cognito user enable MFA
How can I enable SMS MFA for cognito user? I have tried several APIs from Python and Golang and all of them are implementation of AdminSetUserMFAPreference. I call it like that for Golang:
enableMFAStatus, err := cogIProv.AdminSetUserMFAPreferenceWithContext(ctx, &cip.AdminSetUserMFAPreferenceInput{
		UserPoolId: aws.String(userPoolID),
		Username:   aws.String(username),
		SMSMfaSettings: &cip.SMSMfaSettingsType{
			Enabled:      aws.Bool(true),
			PreferredMfa: aws.Bool(true),
		},
	})

And the next way for Python:
response = self.cognitoClient.admin_set_user_mfa_preference(
                        SMSMfaSettings={
                            'Enabled': True,
                            'PreferredMfa': True
                        },
                        UserPoolId=self.userPoolID,
                        Username=userID,
                    )

And I receive success result and no errors but nothing changes. Maybe there are other ways to enable SMS MFA for user? Please help me."

Go Development	"Gorilla/mux cannot return a value for path parameter.
Hi,
I’ve been using multiplexer from Gorilla/mux for a while and happy about it. Until suddenly it’s not working anymore when I redeployed my app to AWS Beanstalk.
Every time that I try to access a path with parameter, the value of the parameter is always empty. But that’s not the case if the path doesn’t have a parameter.

For example, given the URL of http://www.mydomain.net/myresource/{id}, the value of {id} is empty.
But it works if I have a path without parameter like the following example:
http://www.mydomain.net/myresource.

This is only happening if I do deployment from AWS CodePipeline which kicks of CodeBuild, and deploys directly to AWS Beanstalk. If I build from my local box and deploy it to AWS Beanstalk it will work. I can also run it it in my local box.
It seems there is something not right in AWS CodeBuild. I run dep, so the package that’s put in the vendor folder is the same version as what I have in my local box, and I have double checked to make sure they are identical.  Out of curiosity, I have also tried to update using other multiplexer and it gave the same result.  No error whatsoever, and I check the length of mux.Vars is 0

My question, what steps that I need to do to troubleshooting this?  I've been stuck with this for two days already.

Thanks
