AWS CodeDeploy	"AWS CodeDeploy with Autoscaling Launch Templates with Spot and On-Demand In
Hello! It is possible to configure an autoscaling group to use Launch Template instead of Launch Configuration. I want to use it because when I configure an autoscaling group using Launch Configuration I can not set mixed instances policy (ondemand + spot instances).

I have created launch template (name 'test') with such configuration:

        AMI Ubuntu 16, 
        some security groups and IAM Role with EC2, AutoScaling and CodeDeploy full access 
        and all other settings in default *Not specified* state.
    
        Launch Template ID lt-0e1111
        Default Version Number 1
        Launch Template Name test
        Owner arn:aws:iam::11111111:user/itsp
        Version  1 (Default)
        Name  test

Then I am creating an AutoScaling group with that launch template. Here is my autoscaling group configuration:

    Launch Template test
    Launch Template Version 1
    Launch Template Description -
    Instance Types -
    Spot Diversity 0
    Optional On-Demand Base 0
    On-Demand Percentage 0%
    Desired Capacity 1

    Health Check Grace Period 300
    Instance Protection - 
    Termination Policies Default

    Placement Groups -
    Default Cooldown 300
    Enabled Metrics -
    Creation Time Fri Feb 08 00:50:16 GMT+300 2019
    Service-Linked Role arn:aws:iam::11111111111:role/aws-service-role/autoscaling.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForAutoScaling 


Such configuration appears to be set when I choose 

    *Fleet Composition - Adhere to the launch template
    The launch template determines the instance type and purchase option (On-Demand or Spot).* 


option and my lauch template configuration is described above.

So there are no spots in my autoscaling group.

Then I configure a CodeDeploy application 'Application' and DeploymentGroup 'DG_TEST' inside of it with such configuration:

   Deployment type Blue/green
    Service role ARN arn:aws:iam::11111111111111:role/CodeDeployRole
    Deployment configuration CodeDeployDefault.AllAtOnce
    Rollback enabled -
    Environment configuration: Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups -> Name 'test' 



Ok, after everything is set up I set desired instances count to 1 in my Autoscaling group and new on-demand instance spawns in my 'test' group.

I am now starting a blue-green deployment with AWS CLI command:

    aws deploy create-deployment --application-name Application --s3-location bucket=codedeploybucket,key=application,bundleType=zip --deployment-group-name DG_TEST 


And I can see new autoscaling group with same lauch template appears in my green fleet.

So we just checked all our services are working as expected.


Now I want to tweak my autoscaling group configuration a little to mix ondemand and spot instances in it:

    Fleet Composition - Combine purchase options and instances
    Choose a mix of On-Demand Instances and Spot Instances and multiple instance types. Spot Instances are automatically launched at the lowest price available.
    Instance Types:
    t2.nano (1vCPUs, 0.5GiB)
    t2.small (1vCPUs, 2GiB)
    t2.micro (1vCPUs, 1GiB)
    Maximum Spot Price - Use default (recommended)
    Spot Allocation Strategy - Diversify Spot Instances across your 2 lowest priced instance types per Availability Zone
    Optional On-Demand Base - Designate the first 0 instances as On-Demand
    On-Demand Percentage 50% On-Demand and 50% Spot
    Desired Capacity 1
    Min 1
    Max 1 


I save it and try same AWS CLI command

    aws deploy create-deployment --application-name Application --s3-location bucket=codedeploybucket,key=application,bundleType=zip --deployment-group-name DG_TEST 


And now I have my deployment failed with such comment:

    The following validation error occurred: Valid requests must contain either LaunchTemplate, LaunchConfigurationName, InstanceId or MixedInstancesPolicy parameter. (Service: AmazonAutoScaling; Status Code: 400; Error Code: ValidationError; Request ID: 11111114-2b2b-11e9-93b7-11111111111) 



Another strange thing is that if I configure my Launch Templae to use spots only:

    Launch Template ID lt-00dc4c187d1111159
    Default Version Number   1
    Launch Template Name test2
    Owner

and use that option in my autoscaling group:

    *Fleet Composition - Adhere to the launch template
        The launch template determines the instance type and purchase option (On-Demand or Spot).* 


Then after same deployment command I receive another error in CodeDeploy (failed deployment reason):

    The IAM role arn:aws:iam::179966034910:role/CodeDeployRole does not give you permission to perform operations in the following AWS service: AmazonAutoScaling. Contact your AWS administrator if you need help. If you are an AWS administrator, you can grant permissions to your users or groups by creating IAM policies. 


And that is definitely not the case because my role for CodeDeploy have full EC2, Autoscaling and CodeDeploy access.


Am I doing something wrong or that are bugs? How can I configure mixed autoscaling group (ondemand+spot instances) with codedeploy using launch templates? Thanks in advance!"

AWS CodeDeploy	"Re: An error occurred (ThrottlingException) when calling the GetDeployment oper
Hi Adan, 

We do have account based limits on concurrent deployments. However, throttling could be due to various reasons. How many concurrent deployments are you running? Have you recently increased the number of concurrent deployment runs?"
AWS CodeDeploy	"Re: An error occurred (ThrottlingException) when calling the GetDeployment oper
We have been increasing the number of deployments as the project development grows.
We deploy to 4 environments, and each can have 3+ deployment pipelines each.
Just now we had 8 concurrent deployments via BitBucket Pipelines, 2 of which had this error.
Is there a way to increase this limit?

AWS CodeDeploy	"BlockTraffic/AllowTraffic durations
Hello

I've been playing with using CodeDeploy to push our applications live, but it always takes ages doing the BlockTraffic and AllowTraffic steps.

The load balancer I'm using it with has connection draining set to 60s, but the block and allow traffic steps both take (reasonably reliably) 4m25 (265s) to complete which really does drag out the process.

Is there a way to modify this timeout that I've missed?  Can I set the timeout on these steps in the appspec.yml even though these stages aren't documented for the hooks in that file?

Thanks

AWS CodeDeploy	"Re: BlockTraffic/AllowTraffic durations
I'm having this exact issue and was working on this yesterday 4/27. I wonder if it's a coincidence/service issue?

Currently I have a classic ELB with two EC2 nodes. So, If I do a CodeDeploy OneAtATime, the whole process takes up to 25 minutes.

-m"
AWS CodeDeploy	"Re: BlockTraffic/AllowTraffic durations
I have the same issue.  BlockTraffic and AllowTraffic take upwards of 5 minutes.  At first I thought it was due to the fact that my load balancer's Connection Draining was set to 300 seconds.  However, I disabled Connection Draining and got the same results.  I then enabled Connection Draining and set timeout to 5 seconds and still got the same results.

UPDATE: CodeDeploy is dependent on the ELB Health Check settings.  My settings had been:

Timeout	5 seconds
Interval	30 seconds
Unhealthy threshold	2
Healthy threshold	10

As a result, BlockTraffic and AllowTraffic were taking more than five minutes (30s interval * 10 healthy thresholds). After adjusting the settings to the following, BlockTraffic and AllowTraffic took about 20 seconds.

Timeout	2 seconds
Interval	5 seconds
Unhealthy threshold	2
Healthy threshold	2

AWS CodeDeploy	"Re: BlockTraffic/AllowTraffic durations
Yes CodeDeploy depends on the ELB Health Check settings that you have configured your ELB with. After an instance is bound to the ELB, CodeDeploy wait for the status if the instance to be healthy (""inService"") behind the load balancer. This health check is done by ELB and depends on the health check configuration you have set."

I migrated my Classic ELB to Application... and now my BlockTraffic is taking more than 5 minutes, it used to be 1 min, health conditions are the same as before the only change is the migration to Application vs Classic ELB"
AWS CodeDeploy	"Re: BlockTraffic/AllowTraffic durations
I've had the same issue. Has there been any solutions to this yet?"
AWS CodeDeploy	"Re: BlockTraffic/AllowTraffic durations
At a deployment CodeDeploy deregisters the target from the Targetgroup. The Targetgroup now blocks new incoming traffic and gives the instance some time to finish open connections/requests. The instance is now in draining state, which is 300s by default. You can adjust it right here: deregistration-delay.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-target-groups.html#deregistration-delay

  TargetGroup:

      TargetGroupAttributes:
        - Key: deregistration_delay.timeout_seconds

AWS CodeDeploy	"Help: ECS Blue/Green ""Install"" time slower than necessary?
I'm having issues with the deploy speed/performance for ECS CodeDeploy Blue/Green, using the Amazon ECS AMI and an ALB.

In particular, it seems that CodeDeploy has a significant delay in completing the ""Install"" step setting up the tasks in the secondary ALB Target Group. 

Containers start up and ECS says an initial ""stable"" is ready after 15 seconds. But it takes another minute or so for CodeDeploy to ""ready"" the Test ALB endpoint and complete the ""Install"" step. Everything else happens on CodeDeploy in ""Less than 1 second"".

I've watched the Target Groups and ECS registers the tasks in them right away. The health checks are not failing. So I'm not sure what CodeDeploy is waiting for?

Is there any reason why the CodeDeploy step is so slow? It seems to consistently take 1min 40s - 2min 30s for the CodeDeploy step to move forward, despite the containers ready to accept traffic after just 10 seconds or so.

Thanks in advance for any help!

Edit with more info after reviewing CloudTrail Logs:

1. I see the CloudTrail logs for API calls by AWS services during the deployments.
2. I can see that CodeDeploy polls the ECS DescribeServcies API every 20 seconds. 
3. I can see ECS API calls to register the containers with the ALB target group.
4. Then ECS and ALB API calls checking the TargetGroup health status for the Green/Blue ALB Target Groups. They both return ""healthy"" after ~10s. (ECS seems to poll once every 10 seconds). This ties in to when the ECS service logs consider the TaskSet ""Stable"".
4. However.. it takes CodeDeploy a full 1 minute / 3 ""DescribeServices"" API calls after this state to execute the ALB API calls to update the ""Test"" ALB listener to point to the ALB TargetGroup with the new containers.
5. When the ALB Listener is finally updated by CodeDeploy, it happens immediately following that DescribeService call

This means that I'm sitting waiting with ready-to-go containers for a whole extra minute before we can switch them over to live. 

Any reason CodeDeploy isn't performing step 5/Update ALB Listeners after the very first DescribeServices that would be returning the TaskSet as Stable?

AWS CodeDeploy	"CodeDeploy to instances in second subnet fail
Hi,

I'm experiencing some issues these days with CodeDeploy and EC2 instances. I have a VPC with two public subnets (VPC: 10.0.0.0/16 , subnet1: 10.0.0.0/24, subnet2: 10.0.1.0/24), both having assigned an internet gateway. I deploy an EC2 instance to both of them with the correct roles. The problem I have though, is that when using CodeDeploy to deploy to the instance in the first subnet (10.0.0.0/24) it works all the way but when I do the same thing to the instance in the second subnet it remains stuck in pending with no step completed and then times out. Both subnets seem to be the same as configuration but I have no idea why CodeDeploy works with the first one but not the second. 

Other details:

same security group
same roles
same launch template
if I create one more instance in the first subnet, it also works
different deployment groups (but identical, except for machine identification)


Do you have any idea? What could I check? Is there an obvious reason why it fails?

UPDATE:
I tried other scenarios and still no success.

What I tried:

have vpc 10.0.0.0/16 with only one subnet 10.0.1.0/24 and it doesn't work but as soon as I add subnet 10.0.0.0/24 it does
Create vpc 10.0.1.0/24 with one subnet 10.0.1.0/24 and again no success


Apparently it only works in 10.0.0.0/24?

so i think something about SNS, CloudWatch permission is needed somewhere.
but i don't know where.
please answering me.

AWS CodeDeploy	"Re: 'blue/green deploy' with 'auto scaling group' Fails
Unfortunately, this is an issue that customers will likely continue facing. When doing a blue/green deployment where we copy your ASG, we have to copy all of that configuration, which requires CodeDeploy to know about any new attributes that ASG supports. As such, there is a lag. We don't want to break our customers that use fields we don't support yet, so we send back an error message.

There are two options:

Remove field from ASG config SHORT TERM

If the field is non-critical, you can remove it from your ASG config, and the deployment should work.

Wait on CodeDeploy update LONGER TERM

Once CodeDeploy is aware of unsupported ASG fields, we roll out support as quickly as we can. In your case, we have an update rolling out now that should fix your issue, which should be in service in a week or two.

I have a Blue/green deployment with auto scaling group, and even though the deployment doesn't fail, at the end of the whole process, the new Auto scaling group does not have the Target group attribute set.

It does reddirect the traffic to the new instances, but the copy of the Original Auto Scaling group doesn't have the target group assigned at the end of the deployment."

AWS CodeDeploy	"How To Specify Lambda Function Package On CodeDeploy Revision/AppSpec File?
Hi,

I am trying to build a common Serveless DevOps Pipeline, where I expect when I commit code to a repository, this code automatically are compiled and deployed to a lambda function.

So my stack are: CodeCommit >> CodeBuild >> CodeDeploy, where the CodeCommit store the code and commits, the CodeBuild downloads the latest source, compiles and package the application, and CodeDeploy updates the lambda function package. All orchestrated by the CodePipeline and its stages/actions.

Well, my problem is at deploy. I am getting the error: BundleType must be either YAML or JSON at pipeline.


I read the CodeDeploy documentation, and understand the concept of revisions, that are the files that need to be updated on our running environments:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/application-revisions.html

And there are a auxiliar file called appspec (Application Specification), that describes a little bit the running environment that will receive the automatic updates:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/application-specification-files.html#appspec-files-on-lambda-compute-platform

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/reference-appspec-file-structure-resources.html#reference-appspec-file-structure-resources-lambda

But (my misunderstanding) the documentation states that, for lambda, the revision is the own appspec file:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/application-revisions-appspec-file.html#add-appspec-file-lambda


Maybe it justifies my error, because probably the pipeline is providing the latest package to CodeDeploy and not the appspec file.

So my doubt is, for lambda, how we specify the package that needs to be updated on function?

My googles, not to fix but to accomplish the goal, pointed to use of AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model), that uses some CloudFormation templates. But particularly it looks a huge solution for a simple problem. I am trying to use only CodeDeploy before follow this strategy (if I can't do that only with CodeDeploy).

Sorry for the ""big"" post.

Thanks in advance if someone can help. Maybe others would have this same error/doubt.

With the information available, it's hard to say exactly what happened.

If all of that doesn't add up, you may want to consider opening a ticket with support so that they can look at  load balancer configuration and look at things in the service to try to pinpoint the issue."

AWS CodeDeploy	"Re: CodeBuild fails with golang
Hello johnny326, thank you for reaching out to us. I have a suspicious of what is going on and I would love your help to see if we can determine what I suspect it to be. I believe when running go get./... you are in the wrong folder where it can see all dependencies. Have you tried go get github.com/gorilla/mux to see if that is the case? If it is able to get the mux dependency, I would change folders to the root folder and that should allow you to run go get./...

Another option is to use 1.11 and use Go modules. That should take care of handling dependencies altogether.

AWS CodeDeploy	"How to modify appspec.yml for different environments?
I have three environments:
(1) Development,
(2) Staging, and
(3) Production

The S3 bucket has artifacts and contains appspec.yml in the .zip file.

Once deployment starts, the artifacts go to ""Staging"" environment. If at staging it gets approved then it goes to production.

In appspec.yml, I have to check what is the current environment and execute the hook scripts accordingly. Like if the environment is Staging, it should deploy to a different folder and if environment is Production, it should deploy to a different folder in IIS and rename few files there in.

My appspec.yml looks something like this:

version: 0.0
os: windows
files:
  - source: \DemoApp
    destination: C:\inetpub\wwwroot
- source: \DemoApp
    destination: C:\inetpub\wwwroot\ProdApps
hooks:
    AfterInstall:
        - location: code_deploy/post_install.ps1
            timeout: 600
            runas: ec2-user


Here, the second source and destination is for Production Environment and the first one is for Staging. How to check the current environment and choose source and destination accordingly?"
AWS CodeDeploy	"Re: How to modify appspec.yml for different environments?
Hi,

You can combine with codepipeline to create Stage and Action to get approval.

It should not share your deployment environment to dev and staging or production.
In case you have separate servers for each of environments you will check the environment variable inside shared powershell code defined at hooks.

Hope this help."
AWS CodeDeploy	"Re: How to modify appspec.yml for different environments?
You don't in CodeDeploy. 

You can use a CI tool like CodePipeline, Jenkins, or Bamboo, to write a different version of the appspec for each environment. 

or

You can also write you script to read CodeDeploy Variables. https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/using-codedeploy-environment-variables/

I finally fixed the issue. There are several causes for this HEALTH_CONSTRAINT error and this is one of them.

I resolved this issue by creating an Elastic IP and associating it with EC2 instance. Internally there were some access related errors. After associating it, I edited the IIS Bindings and added one more IP (Elastic IP) with port 8080.

It worked."

AWS CodeDeploy	"How do you run PowerShell scripts in 64-bit mode from a hook?
Team,

According to my testing, the CodeDeploy agent runs PowerShell scripts (.ps1) in 32-bit mode and almost anything you do with a modern, 2012R2 Service instance is going to be in 64-bit mode.  

Is there some magic switch to get CodeDeploy to run your scripts in 64-bit mode?  I think I can put a wrapper around the hook script but that seems pretty ghetto and unnecessary.

Thanx!
  Richard"
AWS CodeDeploy	"Re: How do you run PowerShell scripts in 64-bit mode from a hook?
Hi,

We had a similar problem and solved it using the following method.

in the appsepc.yml file specify a batch file against the hook of your choice.

BeforeInstall:
    - location: \Scripts\runscript.bat

Then inside that execute a powershell script using the following method

%SystemRoot%\sysnative\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -command "".\runscript.ps1""

The Codedeploy agent is actually a 32bit application and as such the command prompt is also running under a 32bit environment. 

Using the sysnative virtual folder allows you to gain access to a 64bit powershell environment or any other 64 bit executable that you require.

Hope this helps you"
AWS CodeDeploy	"Re: How do you run PowerShell scripts in 64-bit mode from a hook?
I found a workaround to the problem of running 64-bit PowerShell scripts.  I found this little snippet on the PowerShell Code Repository and it works great.  Just add it to the top of your script and add your 64-bit code to the end.  Perfect!

Just an FYI to anyone thinking about implementing this work around  - 

If you go with this solution to restart powershell in 64bit mode, be aware that the new 64bit PS session will not pass exit codes back to CodeDeploy. So if you're script encounters an error, CodeDeploy will still report the deployment as a success.

$lastexitcode needs to be added to the 'exit 32 bit script section' so the exit code is passed back to the 32 bit PS session and then back to CodeDeploy. See below:

Hi jlatwork,

The timeouts are in seconds, but the timeout is for how long that specific script can take, not the hook as a whole. The time for each step includes running your script and doing the calls we need to do behind the scenes.

AWS CodeDeploy	"Re: Slow deployment
Hi, sorry I thought I'd get notices when someone replies. 

As you can see in the first part of my original post, this the deployment groups details for a single instance deployment:

ApplicationStop	5:48:00 PM UTC	5:48:01 PM UTC	less than one second	Succeeded		
DownloadBundle	5:50:42 PM UTC	5:51:02 PM UTC	20 secs			Succeeded

ValidateService	5:58:52 PM UTC	5:58:52 PM UTC	less than one second	Succeeded	


By 10'52"" duration, I mean the time difference between the start of the Application Stop and end of ValidateService steps.

By 4'27"" of action, I am totalling the time in the Duration column: 1'20"" + 1'41"" + 1"" + 1"" + 4"" + 1"" + 1"".

During these pauses I can look at top on the machine and nothing is apparently happening.

It's not surprising to me that the duration is so short - the scripts are trivial.  What is surprising is that it waits between these trivial steps for minutes sometimes."
AWS CodeDeploy	"Re: Slow deployment
This continues to be a problem.  I'm looking at a deployment which has been sitting ""In Progress"" for ApplicationStop for 30+ minutes.  (FYI: Deployments > Deployment d-RO92SPKRV > Instance i-087ecaed49c04a864).

ApplicationStop is literally service mv2 stop,  where mv2 is a java process that takes less than a second to stop; as well as a test for a pid file, then kill pid file contents and rm pid file.  The mv2 services is still running."
AWS CodeDeploy	"Occasional Network timeouts Re: Slow deployment
This is happening more and more often now.  The odd thing about these is that sometimes it works.  
Sometimes terminating the instances helps.  It appears to be irregular network timeouts to/from https://codedeploy-commands.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/, which works fine from the command line.

AWS CodeDeploy	"CodeDeploy, deployment failed (Error code: HEALTH_CONSTRAINTS)
Hi,

I'm new to CodeDeploy and trying to automate the whole build process. I have started loving AWS with lots of features and I do all sorts of experiments and learning it. So what I did now. I'm storing my code from my local system to BitBucket (through Git) and from there the automation starts & request goes to AWS S3 for storing build zip file and later CodeDeploy refers that zip file (in S3 bucket) for deployment on my EC2 instance (Unix). However the problem is the deployment fails everytime. And it is very simple test deployment and trying to deploy index.html.
I'm getting following error which is also not much in detailed :-

Deployment Failed
The overall deployment failed because too many individual instances failed deployment, too few healthy instances are available for deployment, or some instances in your deployment group are experiencing problems. (Error code: HEALTH_CONSTRAINTS)

Any idea about this error and how to get it rectified. My EC2 instance is up and running but then why it is showing as health contraints?

Thank you"
AWS CodeDeploy	"Re: CodeDeploy, deployment failed (Error code: HEALTH_CONSTRAINTS)
Hi Vinod,

From the failed deployments, I can see all lifecycle events were skipped. Instance  i-0bcc36e73851297f2 is currently in Stopped state but I can see IAM instance profile is missing. Your Amazon EC2 instances need permission to access the Amazon S3 buckets or GitHub repositories where the applications that will be deployed by AWS CodeDeploy are stored. To launch Amazon EC2 instances that are compatible with AWS CodeDeploy, you must create an additional IAM role, an instance profile. [1]

For such failures, you can always begin with general troubleshooting checklist for a failed deployment [2] and then look for troubleshooting guide on Deployment Issues and Instance issues[3].

[1]http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/how-to-create-iam-instance-profile.html
[2] http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/troubleshooting-general.html

AWS CodeDeploy	"Re: CodeDeploy, deployment failed (Error code: HEALTH_CONSTRAINTS)
To add to what Deepa said, if you do not want to deal with understanding of the IAM roles, instance profles, etc, you can always use our first run wizard to create everything for you. It runs a sample deployment with a lot of resources, EC2 instances and a dummy application, all of which you can re-use later in your deployments"
AWS CodeDeploy	"Re: CodeDeploy, deployment failed (Error code: HEALTH_CONSTRAINTS)
IAM roles etc. would have caused a different error.  Health Constraints would refer to the health check on your load balancer.  Check your health check grace period.  It might need to be increased to give the instance time to get deployed to if you get this error.

AWS CodeDeploy	"Re: CodeDeploy, deployment failed (Error code: HEALTH_CONSTRAINTS)
After working with Codedeploy for a few days I found this actually can be an ec2 instance profile issue.  To verify that is the issue, check your logs on your server.  They are located in:

/var/log/aws/codedeploy-agent/codedeploy-agent.log

If you are missing an EC2 instance profile you will get the error:

2017-09-04 16:42:13 ERROR https://forums.aws.amazon.com/: InstanceAgent::Plugins::CodeDeployPlugin::CommandPoller: Missing credentials - please check if this instance was started with an IAM instance profile"

AWS CodeDeploy	"Re: CodeDeploy, deployment failed (Error code: HEALTH_CONSTRAINTS)
So we have a codedeploy pipeline that sounds very similar to this issue except our instance do have the correct profiles and we have verified this via the cli, can you please have a look at what we are doing wrong because we have been at this for days now.

Cheers"
AWS CodeDeploy	"Re: CodeDeploy, deployment failed (Error code: HEALTH_CONSTRAINTS)
Having same problem with the CodeDeploy stage of the CodePipeline.  Got the IAM roles and Instance profile set up and attached.  CodePipeline successfully gets the source from GitHub, then successfully does the build, and then always fails at the CodeDeploy stage giving an error of a HEALTH_CONSTRAINT.  

However, looking at the logs on the server, I see that the actual problem says ""error code: 5, message: ""Access Denied"". for the put_host_command_complete, and the next line says ""Cannot reach Instance SErvice: Aws:: S3::Errors::AccessDenied.

 I went back and edited the instance profile that I had created and removed my settings and just imported an existing AWS EC2 to S3 Policy and it worked"
AWS CodeDeploy	"Re: CodeDeploy, deployment failed (Error code: HEALTH_CONSTRAINTS)
In my case, I had mistakenly chosen the 'Linux 2' AMI for my CodeDeploy instances, which do not have Ruby and other dependent packages.
Replaced the instances with the standard Linux AMI 2018.03.0, update CodeDeploy to use the new instances and then it worked."
AWS CodeDeploy	"please add support for multiple deployments
Right now, CodeDeploy forces you to bundle everything into one file (ZIP,...).  If you have a big set of files then it takes a long time for a deployment to finish.  This means that during development, if you change one file, you have to wait forever for all files to be deployed.  It would be nice if CodeDeploy supported multiple deployments (e.g. one after the other) then you could separate large binaries into one deployment (that occurs less frequently) and small things that get changed a lot (e.g. configuration files) into another deployment."

AWS CodeDeploy	"Python script support in deployment hook
I'm yet to try out but I wanted to know whether Codedeploy supports python scripts i.e. can i  h'v '.py' file instead of '.sh' file? I guess error handling for python & shell (sub-process) are different. Do i need to be aware of any gotchas to workaround for python support?

Another 'hack' i can think of is to use '.sh' file but use python interpreter at the top instead of bash. Not sure if that will work.

The reason why we want to go down python way is for json object handling during deployment of our package. 'jq' with bash is another option but the script will get convoluted & difficult to mange over time with enhancements.

Any thoughts or recommendation is welcome

AWS CodeDeploy	"CodeDeploy uses wrong revision
I have set up Bitbucket pipelines to build my system and upload it to a S3 bucket and everything works fine to this step. Then CodeDeploy kicks in and creates a Deployment and it seems to be a correct one (the Revision Location matches the latest S3 bucket build file) and deploys to my EC2 instance, however the code is not from the latest build file, it is using my previous build even though it says in Revision Location that it is the latest.

AWS CodeDeploy	"Deploy to Windows EC2 process hangs on ApplicationStart
Hi,

I am having trouble configuring Codedeploy to work with my Java program on a Windows EC2 instance. The ApplictionStart step hangs indefinitely, and nothing I have tried has resolved the issue.

My appspec.yml looks like this:
version: 0.0
os: windows
files:
  - source: my-jar-file.jar
    destination: C:\my-directory
  - source: my-config-file.json
    destination: C:\my-directory
hooks:
  ApplicationStart:
    - location: codedeploy\start.bat
  ApplicationStop:
    - location: codedeploy\stop.bat

And the start.bat file looks like this:
echo ""Start""
cd C:\my-directory
start my-process-name /B java -jar my-jar-file.jar  my-config-file.json
echo ""End""


I can see in the codedeploy logs on my EC2 instance that the start.bat runs the start command, but the final echo ""End""
 does not run.

According to this Codedeploy trouble shooting guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/troubleshooting-deployments.html#troubleshooting-long-running-processes) this may be due to the fact that the output streams are not closed. I tried adding the following to the start line in start.bat:
start my-process-name /B java -jar my-jar-file.jar  my-config-file.json >nul 2>nul <nul


However, the application still hangs indefinitely.

I can find lots of tips on resolving this issue for a Linux machine, but I haven't been able to find any solutions for Windows. 

I think its either I am not redirecting the output streams correctly or that I am incorrectly using the /B flag in the start statement to run my program.

Does anybody have any experience getting this working in Windows? I've tried every variation I can think of but nothing has worked so far."
AWS CodeDeploy	"Blue Green Failed deployment ASG dont get cleaned up
We have to manually come up with a logic to delete them. Otherwise they just hang  there doing nothing. Can CodeDeploy not clean them up after a defined interval or as part of the RollBack policy ?

AWS CodeDeploy	"Re: Blue Green Failed deployment ASG dont get cleaned up
Hello,

The Rollback option is available for Blue/Green deployment, however, it works in a different way. CodeDeploy initiates rollback only if the newly provisioned fleet already has started to serve traffic when the deployment fails or is stopped due to alarm.

CodeDeploy service doesn't perform a rollback if the deployment fails before traffic rerouting, as the current instances are unmodified and still serving traffic.

Pertain to clean up of newly created instances in case of failure, you are right it is not supported yet. I've informed the service team about this feature request, thanks for pointing our attention to this.

Best,
Ruslan."

I want now to configure a new stage in CodePipeline so once the dev changes have been manually approved CodeBuild will deploy the content to the production site in /var/www/html/www.domain.tld.

I cant seem to find a way to do this since Im only allowed one buildspec.yml file, is there anyway to use multiple buildspec files in CodeDeploy, how can I do this?

Any help will be appreciated! Thanks!"
AWS CodeDeploy	"BlockTraffic suddenly takes a lot more time
So, i'm using codedeploy for some time now and yesterday i noticed increased deployment-times.
We have 5 Applications using codedeploy and they all suddenly take 5 minutes more per server due to the BlockTraffic-step, which took 21seconds before (which roughly corresponds with the healthcheck settings of the targetgroups).

Those applications use different loadbalancers and different targetgroups. The last deploy before yesterday was at the 22nd of june, just a few days earlier. so between then and yesterday something changed.
So does anyone have an idea why this would happen?

AWS CodeDeploy	"Re: BlockTraffic suddenly takes a lot more time
Ok, i know now which value is responsible for the extended deployment times. It is the target groups deregistration_delay.timeout_seconds.
Even though the documentation states ""If a deregistering target has no in-flight requests and no active connections, Elastic Load Balancing immediately completes the deregistration process, without waiting for the deregistration delay to elapse.""[1] that is not the case, there are no connection or requests. Monitoring confirms that. I even created a new loadbalancer unknown to anyone.

What i couldn't figure out is, where this change of behaviour comes from. Whether it is to considering this value at all, or some part thinking there are connections.
I just know it worked differently before.

AWS CodeDeploy	"Re: BlockTraffic suddenly takes a lot more time
Hi sebastianreloadedone,

We previously were not honoring the deregistration delay. Since we fixed that, the BlockTraffic takes longer. I believe by default, the deregistration delay is set to 5 minutes.

Thank you"
AWS CodeDeploy	"Re: BlockTraffic suddenly takes a lot more time
Hi sebastianreloadedone, 

You are correct. The delay comes from the value that you set for deregistration_delay for your load balancer. Previously, there was a bug where CodeDeploy did not respect the deregistration_delay set by users for their load balancers and that affected users who wanted to have proper connection draining. Since the default deregistration_delay set by ELB is 300 secs you are suddenly seeing this increase in deployment time. You should be able to adjust the delay as appropriate for your service and that should reduce the deployment time. This is not a bug but a valid behavior."
AWS CodeDeploy	"Re: BlockTraffic suddenly takes a lot more time
Thank you for the confirmation.

One last question concerning this sentence in the documentation:
""If a deregistering target has no in-flight requests and no active connections, Elastic Load Balancing immediately completes the deregistration process, without waiting for the deregistration delay to elapse. However, even though target deregistration is complete, the status of the target will be displayed as draining until the deregistration delay elapses.""

Does this mean the BlockTraffic-step takes as long as the deregistration_delay is set, even though the deregistration is already complete?
Im asking because in my test setup there were definitely no requests and it still took 300 seconds."
AWS CodeDeploy	"Re: BlockTraffic suddenly takes a lot more time
Hello,

Yes, BeforeTraffic-step will take as long as deregistration_delay is set and by default deregistration_delay is set to 300 seconds."
AWS CodeDeploy	"Re: BlockTraffic suddenly takes a lot more time
Would be nice to shorten the step when the deregistration was already successful, but anyway thanks for solving this."

Hi

I am trying sample deployment to Amazon EC2 instances  using Amazon Code Deploy by following code deploy tutorial document at the final step when i hit the deploy button i am receiving a error 
"""" Error
The security token included in the request is invalid""""

I am at learning phase i am unable to figure out what  causing error any advise will be really appreciated.

many Thanks"
AWS CodeDeploy	"Re: Code Deploy --Error The security token included in the request is invalid
Since you said you ""hit the deploy button"" I am assuming you are using CodeDeploy console.
I believe after you login your token is set get invalid in short period of time.
You need to check this.

Also try this, when you get this message try logging in again in a new tab and see if you can deploy now."
AWS CodeDeploy	"Re: Code Deploy --Error The security token included in the request is invalid
I also hit this error while trying to follow the ""Deploy Code to a Virtual Machine"" tutorial. Per your suggestion, I tried logging out and logging immediately back in in another tab. I then proceeded through the 9 steps of the wizard as fast as possible. However, I still get ""Error: The security token included in the request is invalid."" 

I probably just need to learn how to troubleshoot my credentials, but this is hard to get past when I'm taking the tutorial as a total newbie!"
AWS CodeDeploy	"Re: Code Deploy --Error The security token included in the request is invalid
Happy to report that I was able to get past this and deploy for the tutorial by following the much more involved instructions (5 steps under Getting Started) here:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/getting-started-create-service-role.html

Of course in the service role part of the tutorial you'll then need to change it to use the existing role set up, which in the Getting Started step is CodeDeployServiceRole. It's hard for me to tell if something was assumed to be in place by the tutorial but wasn't in place for me, or if I just overlooked a step."
AWS CodeDeploy	"Re: Code Deploy --Error The security token included in the request is invalid
That did the trick. Thanks, reed9999

I created the service role from the IAM console (I gave it the suggested name from the tutorial) and then in the CodeDeploy console, contrary to what the tutorial https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tutorials/deploy-code-vm suggests, I chose Use an existing service role not Create a new service role, and selected the one I had previously created in the IAM console."

Is anyone having these types of failures?  Seems to be happening on random instances in the deployment group. The deployment group is not an Autoscaling type.  We typically start all instance up, then run the CodeDeploy/CodePipeline against them, then stop them via script. Looking at the event logs, there's an entry type like: ""The previous system shutdown at 5:15:58 AM on ‎8/‎8/‎2018 was unexpected."" But it looks as though the codedeployagent is starting up as expected.  Should I clean anything out on the instance so that the next deploy with be successful?

Any ideas?

Hi,
I had been looking to check the blue-green deployment using CodeDeploy and was following the below blog from Ramesh Adabala.

Find that the deployment fails when it tries to install the application at the ""Application Start"" stage. I looked to use the same set of codes as shared in the blog, yet got the error. 

Did look at other posts on similar error but none was at the ""Application Start"" stage.

I am having a similar issue as well.  I am using the same CodeDeploy application for different CodePipelines.  This is used as my staging server and we have multiple GitHub being deployed to this instance under different subdirectories unser /var/www/html.

AWS CodeDeploy	"Bug in AWS Console found - Revision location is always wrong
Hi guys,

I think I found a bug in the AWS Console with CodeDeploy.
And else its very anti user friendly :-D

So we are talking about adding a new deployment.
https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/home?region=eu-west-1#/deployments/new

1. Try with bucket=...
2018-08-06 23_31_53-AWS CodeDeploy Management.png
Revision location is ""bucket=my-bucket,key=appspec.yml,bundleType=YAML"".
Error message: The detected file type for the specified Revision Location is unsupported.

2. Try with the example s3://
s3://my-bucket/appspec.yml
2018-08-06 23_33_59-AWS CodeDeploy Management.png
Error message: Bucket, Key and BundleType must be specified

3. Try with the whole url
https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/my-bucket/appspec.yml
Error message: Bucket, Key and BundleType must be specified

OK let's help the web console a bit with the AWS CLI.
aws deploy register-application-revision --application-name MyDeployApp --s3-location bucket=my-bucket,key=appspec.yml,bundleType=YAML

Ah, now it shows me this revision in the autocomplete of the web console.
But oh no, I get the same error again, if I want to select this revision.
Error message: Bucket, Key and BundleType must be specified

I tried with a distribution.zip file on S3 and with different S3 permissions.
At the end I tried to only have the appspec.yml there because its working when I specify it manually.

So I dont know but I tried this now since 3-4 hours.
This must be a bug on aws web console.
I dont know what the mistake could be.
The examples says something about s3:// and the docs saying something similar.

Please check.
Thanks in Advance.
But I give up now. Its not possible :-D"
