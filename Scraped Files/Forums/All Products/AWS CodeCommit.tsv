AWS CodeCommit	"how resolve the merging issue
Hi,
Using Code Commit console when I am trying to merge the branch I get the following error.

There are conflicts between branch and master that cannot be merged in the AWS CodeCommit console. Merge conflicts must be resolved locally before merging.

what step do I need to take to resolve the issue.  I am new to code commit."
AWS CodeCommit	"Re: how resolve the merging issue
Hi bshah,

Sorry you are having problems merging branches in CodeCommit console. Don't worry if you are new, we can help you.

CodeCommit supports only merging branches by Fast Forward, which means that merging is only possible if the branch you are trying to merge into (destination) has not advanced - don't have any new commit - after the branch you are using as source was created.

If you are seeing that error message, it means that destination branch has indeed advanced and now you need to manually resolve that conflict.

To resolved it, you need to fetch the Pull Request branch, rebase it with the destination branch and push the result back to CodeCommit, updating the Pull Request branch. After that, console should say the pull request is mergeable.

There are more information here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/how-to-close-pull-request.html?icmpid=docs_acc_console_pr#why-git-merge"

AWS CodeCommit	"No access over IPv6
I'm trying to use CodeBuild in a VPC without a NAT gateway (in order to save costs). This means that my build can only access IPv6 addresses on the internet. 
Unfortunately, this seems to mean that the build cannot access CodeCommit in order to check out my code. In the DNS, there is no AAAA record for git-codecommit.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com.
This also means that I cannot pull or push code from my laptop when I'm connected via an IPv6-only network.
Are there any plans to enable IPv6 access to CodeCommit?"

AWS CodeCommit	"Re: Notification Event Format
1. What are the possible values for `eventName`?
TriggerEventTest (used when you test a trigger in the console or call the TestRepositoryTriggers API), ReferenceChanges (used when there is a push to the repo)

2. What is the purpose of `eventPartNumber` and `eventTotalParts`?
The event may be split into multiple messages due to payload size restrictions in SNS and Lambda. For example, this would happen when pushing more than 20 branches or tags in a single ""git push"", or when migrating a repository to CodeCommit that has many branches and tags. All messages for the same event will share the same ""eventId"", and can be re-assembled using ""eventPartNumber"" and ""eventTotalParts"".

3. Will I ever receive multiple records in the `Records` array?
We do not currently send multiple records in the Records array, but the format allows us to do so in the future."

AWS CodeCommit	"Commit has the wrong Author
Hello,

A commit to CodeCommit repository has an Author an IAM user X (the one used to initialize eb cli), while it has been pushed using the credentials of another IAM user Y which is the one having ""AWSCodeCommitFullAccess"" permission.

I guess I am missing something here.
Does anybody have a clue?"
AWS CodeCommit	"Re: Commit has the wrong Author
Hi,

Git commits have two identifying pieces of information(author, and committer). In the AWS console, we (currently) only display the 'committer' value, (which is confusingly labeled as 'author'). I suspect your commit has differing author and committer values.

To validate these values with CodeCommit, you can call our 'get-commit' api directly from the AWS CLI. To do this, first configure your system with the AWS CLI (follow instructions on https://aws.amazon.com/cli/), and configure the CLI with credentials to access your AWS account where your CodeCommit repository lives.

Provide the repository name and 40-character SHA-1 of the commit to the api input:
 aws codecommit get-commit --repository-name <repository-name> --commit-id <c2c67acfe...> 


The output should contain both Author and Committer information, and you should be able to validate the author and committer are as you expect. More information on 'get-commit' can be found on the get-commit cli documentation page: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/codecommit/get-commit.html

I have also filed an issue internally to display both Author and Committer values through the AWS Console page when the values differ. Thanks for your feedback!"
AWS CodeCommit	"Re: Commit has the wrong Author
Hi David,

Thank you for your reply.
The API has returned the same user for Author and Committer: the user that initialized the EB CLI and the local git repository.

The thing that I was confused about is the following:
the commit had been pushed using the Git Credentials of another user which has the ""AWS CodeCommit Managed Policy"", which I thought would make this user to show as Committer in CodeCommit.

Could you please provide some links or information on how to have two committers (IAM users) in AWS cloud9 environment? So eventually in CodeCommit, we will see the two IAM users show, each one for his own commits."
AWS CodeCommit	"Re: Commit has the wrong Author
For future inquirers, CodeCommit console does show the author of the commit.
If more than one developer are committing to the repository, the author of a commit can be set in a convenient way while committing like the following:

git commit --author=""NAME <EMAIL>"" -m ""commit label"""
AWS CodeCommit	"Slow clone speed using CodeBuild
Hi, we've recently started using CodeBuild and the `DOWNLOAD_SOURCE` step which clones from CodeCommit is very slow.

For a branch that has not been built before it can take between 4 and 6 minutes to clone the repository, which is a huge proportion of the total build time. Building the same branch repeatedly speed things up, and after 10 builds it can be down to ~45 seconds. Pushing a single commit will reset things back up to the 5 minute mark.

Our repository is ~600mb, with a ~250mb .git folder, and we are using a clone depth of 1.

Generally we find all git operations are slow with CodeCommit - 45 second pull / push times for a commit are common, which is significantly slower than any other git hosting service."

Hi, I'm sorry to hear about this issue. Let's see if we can figure out what's going on here; agree that it's not a great experience to re-create the repository and lose the commit history. A few questions for you:

1. Can you confirm there weren't any concurrent operations, like a DeleteFile or a GitPush (that deletes the blob), that may have deleted the blob inadvertently?
2. Has this occurred just once or every time you re-create the repo with the same blob?
3. If possible, can you try using a different branch and then view the blob?"

Hi All,
I've configured my repo to trigger a lambda on ALL repo events and branches. When I push any branch, I can see my Lambda being invoked.

AWS CodeCommit	"Re: PR merge via CodeCommit UI does NOT trigger my Lambda?
Hi Scott,

You have found a bug - we are currently not emitting Trigger events on Merge Pull Request. We are working to enable this feature. However, in the meantime, you can consider using Cloudwatch Events (CWE) to enable the expected behavior.

To do this:
1. Create a CloudWatch Events Rule.
    Service Name: CodeCommit
    Event Type: CodeCommit Repository State Change

You can specify ""Any resource by ARN"", or select specific repositories by choosing ""Specific resource(s) by ARN"" and supplying the ARN of your CodeCommit repository(ies).
2. On your CWE Rule, select the 'Targets'. These are the service(s) which will be notified about the events. In your case, you would likely want to select 'Lambda function'.

You can choose your existing Lambda function - or write a new one. The thing to note is that the payload from CWE about repository events is not the same format as the one used with Triggers, so it won't map 1:1 with your existing function.

This rule will publish CodeCommit repository events (such as referenceCreated, referenceUpdated, referenceDeleted) to your CWE Rule targets. This includes events from Pull Request merges, in addition to reference updates directly from Git pushes.

Here is some documentation on the CodeCommit event type payloads, which should help with modifying/creating a new lambda function: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/EventTypes.html#codecommit_event_type"

AWS CodeCommit	"Code Commit Branching Error
Hello, I hope someone can help, we keep going into AWS Commit Visualiser and there is a big black line going up through the middle (for which i think is the master branch), however we have two branches, branch a seems to generate a new line from the master branch of a different colour and goes back in like we expect, however branch b does not.

Here is the visualiser, it shows branch a working fine however its not showing it on branch b.

Change to Branch
Make Changes
Commit Changes
Push To Origin
Change To Master
Merge Branch we made the changes on into Master."
AWS CodeCommit	"Re: Code Commit Branching Error
Hi,
If I understood your use case correctly, you have a branch master that look say look like this 
C2 -> C1 -> C0.
You create a branch off C1 (lets call this branch B1).
You create another branch from C1 (lets call this branch B2) and add a commit C4
Now you create a commit C3 to branch B1 and merge it into master (creating a merge commit C5).  At this time you repo looks like this
          B2
           |
master    C4    
 |          \ 
C5 -> C2 -> C1 -> C0
     \      / 
        C3 
        |
        B1

Now from the graph the history of master branch includes commits C5, C2, C3, C1, C0.  Hence when you visualize the master branch in the commit visualizer you can see commits C3 (which is part of branch B1 and master since we merged it into master).  However we don't see C4 since it's part of branch B2 and was never merged into master.

The black line in the commit visualizer is the color of the current branch that you have selected.  So if you select master, commits C5 C2, C1 and C0 are part of the black line and commit C3 will be of a different color and will come back into master since we merged it.

I hope I understood your use case and this answers your question.

AWS CodeCommit	"Re: Code Commit Branching Error
I hope this explains better:

AWS CodeCommit	"Re: Code Commit Branching Error
Hi,
Git does a fast forward merge by default whenever it is possible (https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#git-config-mergeff).  So when you merged the your first branch to master, since they shared the same parent commit, git did a fast forward merge.  That's the reason you don't see the branching in the graph.
Now follow the same steps as you did except for a slight difference in step 3
1. Commit and push to master branch
2. Create a new branch and commit a file
3. Change to master and merge using the following command
git merge --no-ff <branchname>

--no-ff means don't do a fast forward merge which will force to create a new merge commit.
And then follow the rest of the steps.

Please let me know if that resolved your question.

Hi,

There is some news about GIT LFS support with AWS CodeCommit ?

Thx !"
AWS CodeCommit	"Re: CodeCommit support for git-lfs
I've just done a test and I cannot push with LFS. We know we don't use codecommit now."
AWS CodeCommit	"Re: CodeCommit support for git-lfs
I would love to have git-lfs support in code commit, for several reasons:
() consolidation of storage and revision control on a single platform, 
() (hopefully) consistent pricing between GIT-LFS and S3
() the possibility of transitioning old versions of large blobs to glacier storage, etc.

Imho GIT-LFS is one of the areas in which AWS could obtain a clear lead with respect to other established GIT services providers.

Thanks
Stefano"
AWS CodeCommit	"Re: CodeCommit support for git-lfs
agree with others here that adding support for git-lfs as a standard part of AWS code commit with objects stored in S3 would be perfect.

There is already some people creating ways of doing this if you host your own git lfs server so people can probably roll their own (e.g .https://github.com/meltingice/git-lfs-s3 ) but isnt this what AWS is all about - providing not only building blocks (like s3 and code commit) but also saving others the effort of creating things they need (and things they dont know they need until they start using them) ?"
AWS CodeCommit	"Re: CodeCommit support for git-lfs
Please consider to speed up the integration of this feature! Bigger projects can't be really hosted on CodeCommit now."
AWS CodeCommit	"Re: CodeCommit support for git-lfs
It would be really helpful to have support to git LFS in AWS code pipeline indeed.
Such a great feature from git, and is supported by a lot of CI systems. It is a pity it is not supported here yet."
AWS CodeCommit	"Codecommit sns trigger problem
Hey folks, 

Having a bit of a headscratcher. I have a repository with a trigger set to post all events from all branches to an SNS topic which gets funneled to SQS where a Jenkins plugin picks up the changes.

The issue I am having is when I use the 'Test Trigger' button when setting up the trigger everything works just fine. However when one of the devs, commits using their tools it does not appear that the trigger fires. I can see nothing propagating to SQS. 

I know the repo itself works, I have a different trigger that calls a Lambda function that does get triggered. So it appears to be an issue with SNS to SQS specifically. 

Attempts to remedy:
1. I have removed the trigger and added it again.
2. I have changed the SNS policy to allow any user, even though they were all set up by the same user. 
3. I have verified that all components are in the same region. 
4. I added my mobile as a subscriber to the topic, and it is getting the triggered.

It is just strange that the 'Test Trigger' button does work as expected, but the real commit events do not.

Any thoughts or direction to try would be appreciated.

Hi humansimulator,

Your SQS queue policy needs to allow SNS to do SQS:SendMessage on it. Something like this:
{
  ""Version"": ""2012-10-17"",
  ""Id"": ""..."",
  ""Statement"": [
    {
      ""Sid"": ""..."",
      ""Effect"": ""Allow"",

I appreciate the feedback. I think I identified the issue. It is a bug in the SQS Codecommit Jenkins plugin when using Pipelines. The plugin receives the message from SQS, but is not detecting changes and therefore will not trigger a build."
AWS CodeCommit	"No GitClone event in CloudTrail?
Does anyone have any insight as to why there are CloudTrail events for GitPull and GitPush, but not GitClone?

Given the purpose of CloudTrail, it feels like an oversight that a user can perform a clone of a CodeCommit repo without it being recorded in a trail.....?"
AWS CodeCommit	"Re: No GitClone event in CloudTrail?
Hi,

Git clones are fundamentally the same as Git pulls, except that the data transferred to the client includes the full git repository history. In CodeCommit, the action governing clones (and pulls and fetches) is GitPull. Your clones will show up in CloudTrail as GitPull actions, and will indicate that pack data was transferred to the client.

Are you referring to composer the PHP dependency management system? https://getcomposer.org/doc/05-repositories.md ?

It seems like you would need to generate a pair of public private SSH key pair.

Upload your public key to your IAM user's CodeCommit SSH Keys.

Record your SSH Key ID for your public key (starts with APKA)

Make sure your private and public key is registered with composer.

Can I generate Git credentials for the IAM users in the primary account and use them for a repository in the secondary at all? 

Unfortunately, you cannot use Git Credentials or SSH keys to access a CodeCommit repository in another account (You would have to configure the Credential Helper). For the simplest configuration, we recommend creating an IAM user in your secondary account, generate Git Credentials for that user, and use that for accessing your repository. However, by following the link above, there are instructions for setting up the x-account user configuration via credential helper authentication.

Sorry to hear you're having trouble. It might be possible that your operating system is caching the credentials you first provided.

Go to: Control Panel\User Accounts\Credential Manager
Under ""Windows Credentials"", see if there are any git-related credentials under ""Generic Credentials"". If so, deleting them should require vs to re-prompt you for your credentials again.

If that doesn't work, I would check to see if you have other credential managers configured for visual studio's git instance. It's likely the credential may be cached there."

Hi philsw,
Sorry to hear your developers have slow experience when using codecommit.

AWS CodeCommit	"getDifferences alternates before/after blob ID locations inconveniently
Short Story:
My life would be easier if getDifferences responses always placed the blobID (of the version of interest) immediately adjacent to the changeType.  Today it does this for Adds and Deletes, but not for Modifications, which include the pre-modified blobID between the current blobID and the changeType. This forces me to make multiple match attempts, rather than testing the response with a single pattern, to get the info I need. 

Background:
I'm working on a Python language lambda function in which I use .getDifferences to figure out which files changed between two commits.  I used the list to build or delete files in an S3 bucket, so that the S3 bucket is kept up-to-date with the repository.

The problem I had was this:  
File Adds and file Deletes listed in the .getDifferences response placed the desired blob ID in the blob data field immediately preceding the changeType field (which indicate D,A,M, etc..).  The response, though, for Modified files includes both beforeBlob and afterBlob, but places the blob of interest (afterBlob) in the first position, meaning another blobID exists between the desired blobID and the changeType field.  

I can't just look for the afterBlob ID (which was my first thought) because deletes require the beforeBlob. 

In order to make my regex work it would have to be twice as complex, if it can even be done (not saying it can't, I just haven't figured it out).  The alternative, that I went with, was to just run two tests, one for the Add/Delete pattern and then another for the Modification pattern.  Here is the final result:

Hi linklight,

Thanks for the contact.

I see you are having problems with the order in which the getDifferences API returns the data.

I also see that your function seems to be receiving a string to parse. Are you using boto3 SDK or calling the CLI from your python script to call getDifferences?"
AWS CodeCommit	"Re: getDifferences alternates before/after blob ID locations inconveniently
Apologies, I'm fairly new to both Python and AWS and didn't realize I was getting a dictionary object for my event.  I recoded without regex and just properly accessed the necessary dictionary entries.  (Originally I had flattened it to a string and searched it for matches) 

So... I retract my earlier complaint.  Thanks for taking a moment to respond, though!"
AWS CodeCommit	"Pull requests are showing old changes
We recently ran into an issue with viewing pull requests in CodeCommit.  We were able to get ourselves working again (see below), but we're not sure why the issue came up in the first place, and are nervous it may happen again.  We have several projects in CodeCommit and this was only happening to one of them.

When viewing a pull request in CodeCommit, several files are showing up as having been changed which were not changed by the pull request, even if no changes have been made to the destination branch since creating the source branch.  

Steps to reproduce:

1. git clone <url>
2. cd <project_directory>
3. git co dev
4. git pull
5. git co -b test2
6. add whitespace character to README file in the base directory
7. git-gui
8. Move README to Staged changes
9. Type commit message
10. Click commit
11. Click push
11a. On the command line, diff dev test2 (shows only whitespace change)
12. Log into project in CodeCommit
13. Click Pull requests
14. Click create pull request
15. Leave destination as dev
16. Set Source as test2
17. Click compare
18. Scroll down to see 65 files are marked as having been changed.
19. On the menu on the left in CodeCommit, select Compare
20. Choose dev as Destination branch
21. Choose test2 as source branch
22. Click compare
23. Scroll down to see that only the whitespace change to README is showing up.

As another test, we created a branch (test3) with no changes to it, and created a pull request from that branch.  CodeCommit correctly showed that there were no changes to merge. 

From the command line, we merged the branch with the whitespace character:
git checkout dev
git pull
git checkout test2
git pull
git checkout dev
git merge --squash test2

Oddly enough, merging the test2 branch caused CodeCommit to auto close the pull request made against test3.  

This last merge fixed the issue and our pull requests started appearing correctly again.  However, if anyone has seen something like this before and knows what may have caused it, it would really help to ease our minds."
AWS CodeCommit	"Re: Pull requests are showing old changes
Hi, Is this reproducible and still happening?  I followed the steps to reproduce at my local, but seems I cannot reproduce it at the moment.  Can you provide the git graph to help us better understand the context?"
AWS CodeCommit	"Re: Pull requests are showing old changes
Unfortunately, it is not at all reproducible.  We did a merge with an whitespace change, and that somehow reset whatever was causing this inconsistency to happen, and we haven't had problems since.  Before that reset, though, the steps I listed out were very consistent and reproducible, but only on that repository.  We have several other repositories under the same account, and this was not happening to any of the other repositories.  

As a developer, I know how incredibly unhelpful that is to hear, and there's probably not much you can do about it, but, at the time, we needed to get our checkins back on track, so we did what we could.  I tried creating a support ticket, but, after being on hold for an hour, I sort of gave up.  Mostly, I posted this to see if anyone else had experienced this and if they were able to figure out what they'd done wrong so we could prevent it in the future, and, so that, if it started happening repeatedly, it might raise the priority of the issue.  For now, though, I think we can consider this as a one off and hope it doesn't happen again.

Though, I am curious as to why the Compare and Create Pull Request screens were showing different results.  To me, they seem like almost identical functionality.  And, if it helps, we tried doing the step where you create a pull request from the compare screen, and the pull request created still showed the extra files, where the compare screen did not.

AWS CodeCommit	"Re: Pull requests are showing old changes
This happens a lot with me. Sometimes happens when we reset the branches to have only one commit before the PR. Sometimes is because the page was not refreshed others I don't know. It's too random and is a major problem for me to manage the changes. Usually I don't trust AWS and use the GitExtensions to see what I'm going to merge."
AWS CodeCommit	"No support of recursive merger for PullRequests - unnecessary conflicts
Hi,
one of the reasons I really do not like working with code commit is that reports false merge conflicts while all other major git repositories including local git can do it.

We work on a code base which contains files for configuration management and IAS. 
And multiple people develop multiple parts of a system which do not rely on each other but code needs to be in one repository - this is very typical use-case

So we create multiple branches where branch_A does not contain files from branch_B and then 2 PRs are created PR_A, PR_B. 
When PR_A  is merged CodeCommit uses fast-forward strategy, but then CodeCommit reports that PR_B cannot be merged due existing merge conflicts. 
The only conflict is that PR_B does not contains files from a master branch.
This is typically resolved using recursive merge strategy, however now I need to manually update from master branch_B and push again to update PR_B.

It would be nice if CodeCommit could do it as all other git services can (github, gitlab, bitbucket..).

In the meantime is there any workaround apart from updating manually and re-pushing?

How to reproduce:

example:

1) Master -> Create files a, b | push origin master
echo ""a"" > a; echo ""b"" > b
git add .
git commit -am ""Add files a and b""
git push origin master


2) checkout A -> create file 'aa` | push origin A
git checkout -b A
echo ""aa"" > aa
git add .
git commit -am ""Add aa""
git push origin A


3) chekcout B -> create file `bb` | push origin B
git checkout -b B
echo ""bb"" > bb
git add .
git commit -am ""Add bb""
git push origin B

4) Go to CodeCommit
5) Create PR_A for A 
6) Create PR_B for B 
7)  Merge PR_A into master
8) Try to merge PR_B to master -> CodeCommit says it's merge conflict but it's not"

AWS CodeCommit	"Bug when viewing pull request with collapsed code.
In viewing a pull request, there was an area of untouched code which had been collapsed.  It looks like this was maybe an edge case where the collapse threshold had just been reached, see original.png attached, and notice that the same if block is displayed twice, with the line numbers repeated.

If we expand that area in the pull request, we see the same if block repeated (see expanded.png attached.)  

If we expand other areas of the code within the same file, but not necessarily near the if block, the if block is repeated once for each time an area of code was expanded (see otherareaexpanded.png.)  In each case, the line numbers appear correctly, but it makes it look as though untouched code is repeated over and over again.  

Although this is the only spot in the pull request that we have found this to happen, it is very reproducable within this pull request.  We see the same thing on different machines and after refreshing.  Unfortunately, my whole team dismissed the option to view the old console, and I'm unable to switch back, so I couldn't tell you if the problem is only in the new console, or if this was a pre-existing bug."

Lets assume that you own account B and want to access an repository in account A. The HTTP credentials that you have are attached to an IAM user in account B.

Is there any update on this or are there any workarounds, for example can I GET codecommited files over https?

I note that uploading and editing single files by API is possible:  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/how-to-create-file.html#how-to-create-file-cli

However of the usual core functionality for any data store, only two of five seem to be supported:


Create a single file - aws codecommit put-file
List files - Not supported
Read a single file - Not supported
Update a single file - aws codecommit put-file
Delete a single file - Not supported


A consistent and thorough API would be great!   A workaround is to do a git shallow copy, but that get all the files, just so that I can read one - hardly efficient, slow and might not always fit inside the lambda function.  Update: Just tested and it took 7 seconds to clone when the time budget for the entire function is under 100 milliseconds, so far too slow.  It really does need `get-file` as a very minimum.  The fact that you have a code browser indicates that you have this functionality internally, it is just a matter of exposing it to us hungry developers for consumption.

AWS CodeCommit	"Re: Pull request merging to the wrong branch
Hi,

We would like to help you uncover what went wrong with the Pull Request Merge. Your description does have some good information on it, but we will need a bit more information to try to track what happened.

For our benefit (just to rule out that the pull request wasn't accidentally created to merge to destination branch 'stage', can you navigate to the Pull Request page for which this request was Merged (You may need to filter for 'All Pull Requests')? From this page, underneath the title there should be a line that looks like:

Destination <branchName> <-- Source <branchName>


Can you provide the two branch names in the pull request?

Another option for debugging what happened would be to check your CloudTrail logging (if you have this enabled, which many accounts do by default now IIRC). If you look for the entries for CreatePullRequest and MergePullRequestByFastForward api calls with the associated 'pullRequestId', you can check the 'pullRequestTargets' to make sure the source and destination were configured correctly."

Sorry for the delay.  I was at the AWS Summit and didn't check my email much  The issue was actually caused by a conflict in a feature branch giving a partial pull.  Then when the pull request was made, the files reverted because of the partial pull were missed because the UI shows all files that have been changed in the source branch since the pull request was created, so files outside of what the developer changed are ignored.  

We've since changed our merging strategy to have a merge master who will do a squash to make debugging issues like this easier until CodeCommit is able to handle it in the UI.  We know it's coming soon   We're excitedly and patiently waiting!"

AWS CodeCommit	"Re: Clone repo: RPC failed curl 52 Empty reply from server
To me, it really seems AWS Code Commit is unable to handle these larger repos. This same repo is working fine with other services like bitbucket or gitlab.

For small in-house projects, it is adequate, but anything large like the linux kernel, or even a lot of the Android AOSP repos are painful to use with CodeCommit.

A lot of time we use the public repo, until we need to make changes and then we need a mirror within CodeCommit. Probably half of the repos used with AOSP are unable to be pushed into code commit due to limits on tags/branches. The only option seems to be stripping the tags and/or only pushing our specific branch.

Using the bulk uploader example python script has only ever worked once or twice for me, most of the time it just hangs forever and eventually fails.

I think until these limitations are removed from CodeCommit we will be looking elsewhere to host our git repositories."

In our project, we are creating pull request before merging anything to master.

AWS CodeCommit	"Re: Visual Studio Git CodeCommit Integration
I'm sorry to hear you're still having trouble getting Visual Studio to connect.  One point of clarification is that you cannot use an IAM username and password to connect with our SSH endpoint, only an SSH key with the SSH key ID as the user name.  So your example of ""ssh://A***sshkeyid*****A@git-codecommit.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/TestGit"" as a repository URL is correct, but ""ssh://myIamUsername:myIamUserpassword@git-codecommit.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/TestGit"" is not.

It seems like the error you saw (""Unable to exchange encryption keys."") happens when Visual Studio isn't sending the correct public key (or any public key) to the server.  This blog post recommends using a plugin so that Visual Studio uses TortoiseGit to connect instead of its own git support.

AWS CodeCommit	"Re: IAM User with Read Only permissions cannot see specified allowed repo
Hi folks,

First, I’m sorry you are experiencing issues with setting up your IAM policies for CodeCommit. Regarding the codecommit:ListRepositories issue, you should be able to resolve this by creating a policy which has codecommit:ListRepositories permission on resource “*”.  ListRepositories is not a repository-specific API, so having this permission on any resource other than “*” won’t work, it needs to be “*”. 

A sample policy for your Read Only use case might look like:
{
    ""Version"": ""2012-10-17"",
    ""Statement"": [
        {
            ""Effect"": ""Allow"",
            ""Action"": [
                ""codecommit:ListRepositories""
            ],
            ""Resource"": ""*""
        },
        {
            ""Effect"": ""Allow"",
            ""Action"": [
                ""codecommit:BatchGetRepositories"",
                ""codecommit:Get*"",
                ""codecommit:GitPull"",
                ""codecommit:List*""
            ],
            ""Resource"": ""arn:aws:codecommit:<region>:<account-id>:<repo-name>”
        }
    ]
}

Note that in the console, the users will be able to see that other repositories exist in your account, but clicking on them will show an error rather than allowing them to browse or pull the code.

As for the documentation, I believe you are correct and that the statement about scoping the policy to a specific repository does not explain the ListRepositories action very well, and I will work with our documentation writers to improve this for clarity. Thanks for pointing this out, we do appreciate it!

AWS CodeCommit	"Pipeline triggered with every merge to CodeCommit
Right now, in our pipeline, as soon as code is merged to a branch associated with a pipeline, that pipeline is kicked off.  Initially, in order to prevent the code from being deployed to ElasticBeanstalk, we disabled transition step just after CodeCommit, and, then, when we wanted to deploy, we had to re-enable the step, and when the deploy was done, we disabled it.  We ran into issues, though, because we'd forget to disable the step again.  Additionally, whenever that step was re-enabled, the flow continued from the previous execution, which caused a lot of confusion.  So, we added an approval step in addition to disabling.  This is also not working for us because we're struggling to figure out which execution we're rejecting.  So now, the solution is to enable and reject while periodically refreshing every few minutes.  Overall, it's not ideal.  Is there a way to not have the pipeline execute at all until someone manually hits the Release Change button?"
AWS CodeCommit	"Re: Pipeline triggered with every merge to CodeCommit
Yes, this is possible!

There's a parameter on most source actions called PollForSourceChanges: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/reference-pipeline-structure.html#w207aac36b9b9c15b3

More info: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/run-automatically-polling.html

The behaviour of this parameter can be hard to understand (it's documented here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/pipelines-about-starting.html#change-detection-methods ), so I'll explain here:

A pipeline is either started by polling for changes in CodeCommit (PollForSourceChanges = true) or through a Cloudwatch Event.

If you're using CloudWatch events to trigger your pipeline, you can simply remove the cloudwatch event, and the pipeline will stop triggering automatically. Basically, you want to undo the change described here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/triggering.html

Then, make sure PollForSourceChanges is set to false. For example, your source action configuration will look like this:

{
    ""PollForSourceChanges"": false,
    ""RepositoryName"": ""my-repo"",
    ""BranchName"": ""my-branch""
}


If you're using polling to detect source changes, then you just need to set PollForSourceChanges to false and it'll stop detecting changes.

If you're used to configuring your pipeline via the console, you can find this setting under the source action's configuration named ""Change detection options"". Choose the ""Use Amazon CloudWatch Events to automatically start my pipeline when a change occurs (recommended)"" and then make sure that the Cloudwatch event is deleted in the Cloudwatch console."

AWS CodeCommit	"Re: Better format notification emails
Hi KatieR,

We appreciate your feedback on our notifications, I will discuss with our team to try to address the wordiness with our notifications.

One of the reasons that we chose to not include the comment in the notification was because we assume that comments in your code reviews could contain snippets of code and thus your intellectual property and should be treated with care. We encrypt all comments at rest and no one is able to decrypt, and read comments without an authenticated and authorized request to CodeCommit with AWS Credentials.

Since email does not have authorization or authentication, we want to make sure only people who are authorized to read comments can have access to them. In addition, there is no way to revoke access to these comments once we send them through email. This is why we provide a link to the AWS console by default, instead of delivering the comment directly in the email.

All this being said, if you want to customize the email notification, you can build a lambda function that formats the email to your liking, including having HTML formatted emails if you send emails through SES.

You can use the following APIs within the lambda function to enrich the emails:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/APIReference/API_GetComment.html
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/APIReference/API_GetPullRequest.html

This was good and helpful feedback.  We were looking into using lambdas with our pull requests anyway, since we're looking for a workaround to having to update the branches on other pull requests after one has been merged.  

However, even without the comments themselves, it would be helpful to know how to access the other variables listed, such as the person who performed the action, the title of the pull request, the url to access the pull request, and the pull request id.  All of those variables except for the pull request title are in the current message, just not in a very readable format."
AWS CodeCommit	"Re: Better format notification emails
The cloudwatch event notification will have the PullRequestId or the CommentId associated with the notification.

If you pass that into GetPullRequest or GetComment, you will be able to get the ""authorArn"" which is the IAM identity ARN that represents the person that created the pull request or commented.

If you are looking for the IAM username, from that ARN, it is the last portion in that arn string.

Starting July 13, the Last Updated column never updates. When you open a repository, you will see commits committed after the Last Updated column value. This is down for several days, so time zone offset will probably not be the case.

With approximately 100 repositories and a hard limit on the number of associated AWS Lambda, it has gotten harder to see without calling APIs what repositories have had commits.

Would be helpful when the last update date would be available again. Otherwise, please remove it since it confuses users."

Thank you for the finding, we can reproduce the issue you've found.  We will prioritize this work. Your feedback is very much appreciated."

I've spotted this too. Last update for us is June 15th, despite several repositories of ours having had commits made to them since that date.

Silly, minor issues like this make it harder to convince me to go all-in on the AWS ecosystem. The console these days seems to be erratically unstable in places. It's very clear that different people are responsible for different parts of the console. The vast array of designs makes this pretty obvious (there's some Engrish error messages dotted around too).

Please, co-ordinate your teams, get the console into a decent state, get a QA team involved in the release process, and please...be consistent"

Thanks, I will await a solution."

We have fixed the bug and now it start to deploy.  It should reach to all regions pretty soon.  I will let you know once the deployment is done.

Any news on this? It hasn't reached London as of 29th June @ 1pm UK time."
AWS CodeCommit	"Re: CodeCommit dashboard broken: last update date no longer updated July 13
The bugfix has been deployed to all public CodeCommit regions. Note that this won't backfill the last-modified-date for previous changes, but future changes should update the last-modified-date correctly.

Please let us know if you are still experiencing this issue after today. Thanks!"

Thanks, is available and works again."

Hello Guru's,

I am building an AWS Code Pipeline which will allow EC2 instance to pull code from AWS Code commit. To make this working i have enabled outbound https connection to 0.0.0.0/0, I tried doing nslookup to get ip range but after setting it up, The Deployment fails with timeout error.

Hi BijithNair007

If you set up a CodePipeline pipeline with CodeCommit as a source action, you do not to explicitly clone your repository from CodeCommit with your EC2 instance. CodePipelines does not clone your repository either. When you specify a deployment step which deploys to EC2 instances, CodePipeline will deliver a compressed artifact bundle consisting of the tip of your pipeline tracking branch to each of your instances. This artifact bundle is downloaded from an S3 bucket in your account.

If you need to clone your repository from your EC2 instances, to get previous repository history, the following IP's are CodeCommit's git frontend IPs in ap-southeast-1:

54.240.226.213	
54.240.226.221	
54.240.227.194

They may be subjected to change at a later date. If you think that VPC endpoints for CodeCommit would be a better solution for you, let us know so we can prioritize accordingly."
AWS CodeCommit	"Initial push to CodeCommit repo fails with unpack error/unknown commit
I am unable to push existing commits to a newly created CodeCommit repository.  The scenario is a newly created CodeCommit repository that is empty.

AWS CodeCommit	"Re: Initial push to CodeCommit repo fails with unpack error/unknown commit
Hi,
Is the existing repository a shallow repository by any chance? (cloned using shallow clone?).  If so can you try cloning a fresh full copy from your existing repository and then push that to CodeCommit? 
Thanks,
Aashwin"
AWS CodeCommit	"Re: Initial push to CodeCommit repo fails with unpack error/unknown commit
I just ran into this same issue and as stated above, the existing repository was shallow cloned so it only pulled down the last 50 commits. Using a full clone resolved the issue."
