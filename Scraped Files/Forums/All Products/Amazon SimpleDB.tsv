Amazon SimpleDB	"Delete SimpleDB data from console?
How can I delete my SimpleDB data?  I don't even remember how to use it and there's no option in the console. I'm being charged for it every month, but can't get rid of it."
Amazon SimpleDB	"Re: Delete SimpleDB data from console?
You can use SDBExplorer. SDBExplorer provides a simplified way to edit and manage your data from Amazon SimpleDB. SDBExplorer displays the Amazon SimpleDB data in a table view and it allows you to edit the contents of a cell directly and within the table. In addition, it is so easy to add, delete, edit and update your data by using SDBExplorer. Using SDBExplorer you can Delete Domain, Empty your domain, Delete selected rows and delete attribute value pairs. 

You just need to download a SDBExplorer Version. http://www.sdbexplorer.com/simpledb-download.html

It's free for 30 days so you can give it try

Amazon SimpleDB	"Re: Can't connect to MYSql server on RDS
I had the same problem, and found that I had to go to ""DB Security Groups"" in the Amazon RDS settings, and allow either my EC2 instances or specific IPs (through their CIDR/IP settings) access to the DBs. 

Looks like RDS by default denies access to any outside machines, including your own EC2 instance until you set up the security settings properly.

Also, if you are accessing RDS from an EC2 instance and specifying the IP address of the EC2 instance, make sure to specify the internal IP of the RDS instance, not the external one. You can find this info from the AWS console or typing ifconfig on your Linux EC2 instance shell. Add that IP address to the DB security group.

I noticed today that my monthly AWS bill shows some storage used in SimpleDB. This is curious because I have no recollection of ever using SimpleDB myself. However, it's even more curious that I see entries for EU (Ireland) - this would be my usual region - AND for US East (Northern Virginia).

Amazon SimpleDB	"Timeouts on SimpleDB requests.
I am getting sporadic timeout errors when querying SimpleDB from the tooling in Visual Studio (Visual Studio .Net Tools and SDK) and our application is unable to perform a search on a specific table and instead simply spins without ever returning an error result.

I believe the two are related, with the second problem (with the application) with code in the error marshaller. http://aws-sdk-net\AWSSDK_DotNet35\Amazon.Runtime\Internal\Transform\UnmarshallerContext.cs - the context of this issue is around line 38. It seems to be getting back a result somewhere from the service that starts ""Status Report"", while it appears to be looking for ""Error/Type"" in the response. Therefore the Unmarshall function enters an infinite loop and never returns (occupying significant CPU cycles).

I believe the overall problem is the timeout I mentioned first. Can someone please let me know if there are any known issues currently, on SimpleDB, with timeouts? The second problem seems to be how whatever error is returned and I can open a ticket with the SDK group on that one.

Thanks,

I often have timeouts when querying simpledb - no response is coming for 20 secs and even for 200 secs. I don't know how to solve this. The database I operate is very small, just several thousand records in one table.

More details: the SimpleDB returns HTTP response headers, which specify chunked encoding, but then nothing comes in the body:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

While SimpleDB continues to be visible as a service selection in the AWS service pages (but no longer in the AWS Products and Solutions menu!), the continued lack of investment in a console and relatively low key nature of its presence in the API documentation (with no recent example code, etc) makes me wonder about the utility of investing in a new application which uses the service.

Amazon SimpleDB	"Re: Has SimpleDB been Deprecated?
I couldn't disagree more that about the ""final nail"" or ""death spiral"" remarks. Here we are .. 3 years down the road from those remarks and nothing has changed.  AWS can't simply shoot the elephant while it still has a lot of its customers riding on it.

It would seem to me .. and this is purely speculation by the way .. that DynamoDB simply provides a better product for sales purposes (for AWS) than SimpleDB.  With SimpleDB many customers are getting great performance without needing to set it up with WCUs and RCUs.  Honestly .. if I was selling SDB and Dynamo and profit was the goal ... obviously I would push the product where you have to may more to get incrementally better result.  And on top of that, tuning the product for the correct performance vs value usually ends up with the client wanting to err on the side of caution in terms of not wanting performance degradation vs not wanting to see a few more $ a month on their AWS bill.

The path to mapping at correct performance setup vs value is certainly not straight forward and for many projects .. is in fact pretty muddled.

SimpleDB lives  up to its name in being very simple and still fits many use cases for which DynamoDB is still an over-kill fluster cluck of complexity not qualified for many simple but critical tasks.

I would venture to postulate that until DynamoDB can be significantly simplified, its complexity will keep SimpleDB alive.

Alex,

You might check your root certificate authority file on the system. I am still waiting to hear back from AWS support but I believe  AWS updated their cert on Friday (17th). We also experienced SSL handshake issues on the 17th and traced it down to their certificate chain using a CA authority that wasn't present in our old cacerts file used by Java.

Amazon SimpleDB	"SimpleDB Backup
I realize that SimpleDB is designed to be very durable. I'm still having a problem switching my applications to it, even though in most respects it seems like the perfect solution. The reason is Data Backup.

What happens if I right click on the wrong domain and delete 10M records? What if I have a typo in my code that drops the wrong domain or iterates irreversible changes with massive data loss?

With a relational database I can roll-back anytime-- even if I drop a database. I can also very easily make backups and snapshots of my data. This gives me a lot of comfort knowing that if I screw up (human error)-- I can get my data back?

This doesn't seem possible in SimpleDB at all. I know I could run SimpleDB requests to multiple domains and I could theoretically pull down full backups of SimpleDB. Maybe these are the right solutions-- just seems pretty limited compared to what I can do in MySQL. 

I'm wondering how major services like Netflix deal with the human-error side of data reliability?"
Amazon SimpleDB	"Re: SimpleDB Backup
We are also very interested in having a backup/rollback functionality available in SimpleDB.

 In order to avoid human error or faulty code, we extensively use the IAM capability. When signing into Bolso/SDB Explorer/any other client, we use credentials that do not have drop domain privileges. We use a similar tactic with our code and isolate permissions based on the domains the particular code needs to access. It has been very helpful since we have used it. 

Nonetheless, there are numerous other situations where a backup would be very useful."

Hi guys,

I'm working on a project of a website whose content are all rendered on browser (single page application) and I need to store some user data (eg, the user profile) on a back-end and I'm wondering if simpledb would fit our need.

 We plan to have around 2M profiles stored on simpledb using the user-id as key so queries to locate a given profile would be excellent. When the user logs on with his user-id we would retrieve the correspondent profile from simpledb.

However after reading the Simpledb documentation I was unsure if it's limitations would made our application not practical. We need to be able to handle dozens, sometimes even hundreds, of concurrent logins. Is this possible to be done with simpledb?

What are the limits for concurrent select over a deterministic key?

Thanks for any advice,

Eric"
Amazon SimpleDB	"Re: Advices on using simpledb as storage for simple user profile
Amazon SimpleDB is made for storage of smaller, non-structural data. It has many  limits . You can take advantage of the support for concurrency by writing multithreaded programs for interacting with it but you can achieve much higher data access rates to multiple domains than to a single domain. Other links:  1,  2. Storage limitation is again the issue. You can put your data into Amazon S3 and can link with Amazon SimpleDB by putting virtual path onto Amazon SimpleDB. You cost may increase in this case.  

Amazon DynamoDB may fit on your case. Amazon DynamoDB can be useful for those who need a fast, highly scalable non-relational database. There is no limit on the storage size per table and you can specify how much request capability you require. Amazon DynamoDB offers good performance and incremental scalability. 

DynamoDB is really designed for high performance database but DynamoDB charge money by capacity of Read/Writes per seconds and NOT index your whole data.  link"

Hi Ashish,

Thanks for your inputs however most of those articles and docs approach to write throughput or the query throughput (in the sense of selecting trough a data set). However very little to none information is found regarding simpledb performance for GettAttribute function. In my scenario the writing is not a problem. My concern is about reading since I'm planning to call simpledb GetAttribute directly from the browser (don't worry about the security aspects).

For example, assuming that I'll have multiple simultaneous call of GetAttribute for a dataset on a single domain where each call is getting a distinct Item, how would it perform? What average timings can I expect? Are there any limits about how many items/sec can I read concurrently ?

Amazon SimpleDB	"Re: Advices on using simpledb as storage for simple user profile
What Siddharth Anand said about read performance?:
Reads are throttled at a much higher throughput threshold, perhaps 5x (i.e. 350 reads per second per > domain). However, as your data size grows, your read performance will degrade. 

source

You may find Amazon SimpleDB slow in your usecase as SimpleDB only returns back 2500 results at a time. When there are more results you cursor through the result set using a token mechanism. So you can only issuing requests one after another, with each request starting only when the previous one completes.  Please refer the ""Parallelizing queries by splitting the search range"" on  page if it can help in your case. 

Other related limits:
*Records are not returned in a sorted order
*All data comparisons are done lexicographically
*Maximum response size for SELECT is 1 MB.
