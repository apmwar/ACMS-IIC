Amazon FreeRTOS	"Same MQTT Handle for publishing messages and OTA
Hello,

Is it logical to have the same MQTT handle for publishing messages to AWS and for OTA updates?

I am using ESP32 and running into a memory issues and trying to figure out where to optimize. And so far I had all other custom apps running and MQTT publisher app and then additionally I was just using OTA demo task for updates.  

Thanks

Hi,

Yes, you can reuse the same MQTT handle for both OTA and publishing messages to AWS.

Please let us know if you run into any issue.

Amazon FreeRTOS	"How to detect MQTT disconnections when using Shadow API
My device code is based on the Shadow Demo, that is, it is using Shadow API.
I need to identify connection lost and then to react on it.
I see in aws_api.c prvShadowMQTTCallback that if the MQTT event is eMQTTAgentDisconnect then the code resets the subscriptions to update\get\delete and return with no additional actions.
My questions here are:
1. How can I know that there was a disconnection?
2. Is there any mechanism that I can use to automatically try to resubscribe?"
Amazon FreeRTOS	"Re: How to detect MQTT disconnections when using Shadow API
Please see the response here: https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos/issues/326#issuecomment-465749771

Please let us know if you have any feedback about the new library. We are very interested in your feedback.

Thanks."

Hey,

Have you set up esp IDF path to user profleas in https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/add-idf_path-to-profile.html ?
""export IDF_PATH=~/esp/esp-idf""
Because you don't need to.
Try ""make clean"" and then recompile your project and do ""make erase_flash"" before flashing new firmware."
Amazon FreeRTOS	"Re: Amazon Freertos Espressif ESP32 DevKitC demo is failing to connect
no, IDF_PATH is not defined.
doing the other items described did not help. fails the same way."
Amazon FreeRTOS	"Re: Amazon Freertos Espressif ESP32 DevKitC demo is failing to connect
Hi sblu,

To to re-iterate what FreeOurToes has suggested:

1. Make sure that IDF_PATH is not defined in your system environment variables.
2. Run ""make erase_flash"" before running ""make flash monitor"".

I see the error message ""ERROR: Object with label Device Priv TLS Key not found."" As you may already know, that is probably related to the SPIFFS unable to mount and so the keys could not not be written. 

I have a ESP32DevKitC and I am running the latest version of Amazon FreeRTOS from https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos. The only files I have updated are: aws_clientcredential.h. aws_clientcredential_keys.h, and sdkconfig with only my serial port.

Here are my commands and the output following in the msys32 terminal:

Amazon FreeRTOS	"Re: OTA stuck on a old/previous job
What happens if the OTA library looses connection/disconnects/looses sync with the job and there is an active subscribe to $aws/things/%s/streams/%s/data/cbor?

In the MQTT library, when a new subscribe is started, it checks the subscribe manager list and removes any matching topics. The stream topic will be different for each job / portion of file, correct? Could this be the reason why my subscription manager ran out of room?

Is there a way to purge all subscriptions associated with a mqtt connection from the subscription manager list?"

Amazon FreeRTOS	"Possbility of including a data serialization into FreeRTOS?
Using Proto Buffers right now. Love it, but... 

For me to use protobufs in my AWS IoT application, specifically to keep the BLE packet size small, I need to lambda each incoming and outgoing device message to adjust the data payload. That's a lot of JSON to ProtoBuf conversion. I'd much rather store human readable event data in the database.

Hi SloRo,

Thanks for letting us know.

Amazon FreeRTOS	"New project setup and other Amazon FreeRTOS questions
Hi,

I am very new to Amazon FreeRTOS, but I am looking at using it for a new project, mainly to get the OTA capability.

Some background: The product would probably on based on the ESP32. The product involves some realtime/motion control software (which would be running on the ESP32). Ideally, I'd want to run the wireless/communication on one core and my application on the other. The product must be paired to a phone, and we have fairly realtime requirements for communication. 

Specific questions:
1. Sanity check: Does this sound like an appropriate application for Amazon FreeRTOS on an ESP32?

2. We need to talk point to point to a phone through BTLE. We do not want to go through wifi, and we do not want our messages to hit the cloud. Using the Amazon BTLE library, can we use the phone as a proxy device to get both OTA and direct messaging to the phone? We have full control of our messaging, so if we need to pack it in an MQTT message, that's fine.

3. It's my observation that the Amazon docs are extremely extensive covering the configuration, building and testing of the demos. The Amazon docs seem to stop exactly short of actually taking the Amazon libraries and creating a new non-demo project. This seems to also be the case for the Android proxy app too. What is the best practice way to spin up a fully custom project using AFRTOS? Should I simply copy the libraries out of the demo repo? In that case, it makes upgrading the libs a little bit dirty. I suppose I could also make my new app exist outside of the AFRTOS demo repo, but reference the libs in the demo repo.

Thanks!
Chris"
Amazon FreeRTOS	"Re: New project setup and other Amazon FreeRTOS questions
Hi Chris,

Thanks for looking into Amazon FreeRTOS.

1. Perhaps, but it depends on your communication (and motion control) requirements.  BLE messages can be configured to be sent about every 7.5-20ms.

2. Yes, Amazon FreeRTOS with BLE is currently in Beta, and you can use it to get both MQTT messages and perform OTAs through the phone via BLE. If you do not want to heavily modify the app and device code, you would need to wrap the messages in MQTT. You can configure your MQTT agent to connect to an endpoint of your choice.

Likewise, for OTA with the Amazon FreeRTOS OTA agent, OTA updates would also need to be wrapped by MQTT to use without significant modification. The demo phone application acts as a middle man between the AWS IoT OTA job and the device, and the device OTA agent expects OTAs to be formatted like and respond to requests as the AWS IoT OTA job would.

3. I think there are many ways to start building your custom application - the ways you've suggested could work, and you could also fork the repo & copy/rename/modify the demo folder.

Hope this helps,
Alexa"

Amazon FreeRTOS	"Re: esp-idf, can we get an updated version?
Hi Chris,

Thanks for this input.  The tip of master is based on v3.1.1 of the Espressif IDF (which as you have pointed out, does not have CAN driver code).  

We are currently working on updating our processes to incorporate updated versions of driver libraries more quickly, but I'm not sure what the timeline is for pulling in a version of the IDF that has CAN drivers included.  I will pass this feedback on for prioritization. 

My understanding from our partners at Espressif is that there are a couple additional steps that must be taken in addition to redirecting the makefile to a newer version of the IDF:
-Remove common components that are already present in Amazon FreeRTOS (such as the FreeRTOS kernel or mbedTLS)
-Modify the bootloader to comply with Amazon FreeRTOS over-the-air update requirements

In the meantime, the guidance from Espressif is that it would likely be easier to pull the CAN driver changes into Amazon FreeRTOS rather than point the makefile to an external IDF.

Amazon FreeRTOS	"pxcallback invoking eMQTTAgentDisconnect in endless loop
On one device recently I noticed that I would receive the eMQTTAgentDisconnect in the event callback (pxCallback of the connectionParams) after successfully connecting and successfully subscribing to the broker. My firmware is structured such that there is a 4-6 second delay before reconnecting if the connection was closed. 

Basic pseudo code
mqtt agent create
while(1)
{
mqtt connect
mqtt subscribe
     while(!error)
     {
          mqtt publish
          if error or disconnect callback invoked
              disconnect
      }
delay 4 seconds
}

I am not sure why I was receiving the disconnect message from the broker. I power cycled the device and it connected fine. I do not know if there was something lingering in the MQTT agent instance or what. 

The mqtt broker log showed the connect and disconnect occurring but without any errors. There were a couple of throttling errors reported but the delays were > than the 1 second limit. Right after resetting the device it looks like there was a duplicate client id error and then it recovered. My client ID's are the device MAC address so it should be unique to my device. 

I have had problems with the duplicate client ID issue due to device resets and the disconnect callback seems like the only way to handle it.

What happens if the broker sees a duplicate id scenario but there is only one real client and that is my board? Could there be a possible looping scenario as described above?"

Amazon FreeRTOS	"OTA Updates and bootloader
Hi,

I'm quite new to AWS and aFreeRTOS, so any help would be appreciated.

Basically, I would like to better understand the mechanism for OTA updates. My end goal is to have an STM32 based device that can be upgraded OTA.

So, I assumed that a bootloader would be required for this... there is a reference bootloader provided by Amazon that can be ported.

I'm just a little confused about the responsibility of the bootloader vs the application when doing OTA updates. Normally I would have said that it is the responsibility of the bootloader to allow reprogramming, but maybe the idea is we can first store the updated binary at runtime and attempt to load it next time we reset.

My question is, is it intended that the code in the OTA demo should be located in the""Application"" space of the device, or the bootloader space? I haven't yet understood what should happen when an OTA job is set up... should the device be reset and put into bootloader mode, or handle the firmware download, then trigger a reset and let the bootloader handle the switch over?

I understand that the STM32 is not yet fully supported, so would need a bootloader and OTA port.

Apologies if this sounds a little confused, I am! but that's OK 

Thanks

Ant"
Amazon FreeRTOS	"Re: OTA Updates and bootloader
The OTA library for Amazon FreeRTOS is designed to be able to share a single network socket handle with the application. That approach isn't mandatory, but based on the likely scenario that app data as well as OTA job data are both coming from the AWS IoT MQTT broker, exchanging both using a single context handle reduces our minimum RAM footprint (potentially by a lot). 

Once the device OTA library receives notification of a new update, it subscribes to a new MQTT topic and begins downloading the image. Once all ""chunks"" of the image have been received, the OTA library validates the digital signature of the new image. If the signature checks out, a callback to the app is triggered so that a reboot can be scheduled. There is a portable layer for the OTA library, which you will have to modify, that is responsible for writing image chunks to storage, as well as for performing the signature check. For reference, check out the one for our Visual Studio based simulator, https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos/blob/master/lib/ota/portable/pc/windows/aws_ota_pal.c.

After the reboot, it is the responsibility of the bootloader to load the newest firmware image that has a valid digital signature. For more information, please see our demo bootloader, https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos/tree/master/demos/common/ota/bootloader."
Amazon FreeRTOS	"Re: OTA Updates and bootloader
DanG,

Thanks for taking the time to reply, your answer has cleared up a few things I was unsure about.

I'm glad that you suggested looking at the visual studio based simulator, because that is what I ended up starting on, once I have worked my way through that a bit more I can move on to the bootloader side.

In terms of the bootloader, I will need to understand how the STM32 dual bank flash works, it looks a little different to the Microchip part in that there is not a re-programmable ""boot flash""... only a fixed bootloader (no good), but that is a different problem for a different day.

Thanks again

Amazon FreeRTOS	"Re: OTA update task is failed when it try to get stream
Hello, first, when you create the OTA job in the AWS console for your Amazon FreeRTOS device, please double check that job creation is succeeding. It should display as ""in progress"" in your Jobs view on the console. 

Second, confirm that the OTA job role you're using is configured with sufficient rights as described in https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/create-service-role.html. Note that the OTA service attempts to create the stream from the S3 bucket that contains your digitally signed firmware image. 

Third, can you please describe how you're creating your ""Code signing profile""?"
Amazon FreeRTOS	"Re: OTA update task is failed when it try to get stream
DanG,

Thanks for your reply.

I reviewed settings according to your suggestions, then I was able to start downloading a image.
What I did is re-creating ""Code signer profile"" as following CLI command.

Before (not working)
aws signer put-signing-profile \
--profile-name stm32_dev_profile \
--signing-material certificateArn=arn:aws:acm:ap-northeast-1:<aws id>:certificate/<cert id> \
--platform AWSIoTDeviceManagement-SHA256-ECDSA \
--signing-parameters certname=/ 

After (working!)
aws signer put-signing-profile --profile-name stm32_dev_ota \
--signing-material certificateArn=arn:aws:acm:ap-northeast-1:<aws id>:certificate/<cert id> \
--platform AmazonFreeRTOS-Default \
--signing-parameters certname=/cert

After creating a profile, I created OTA job via web console selecting this profile.
Then, STM started downloading image.

For one's information, would you please let me know difference between these two platforms, ""AmazonFreeRTOS-Default"" and ""AWSIoTDeviceManagement-SHA256-ECDSA""?

Thanks.

Hi uhey22e, you can get the list of signing platforms from the CLI command aws signer list-signing-platforms. A signing platform is a predefined set of instructions for the hash and encryption algorithms used to sign the image. With AmazonFreeRTOS-Default"" and ""AWSIoTDeviceManagement-SHA256-ECDSA, the difference is the signing image format. Hope this helps!

Thank you for your response, Dan.

It turns out I actually didn't have to rename the folder - I just did that when I didn't see it  immediately show up as an MPLAB X project in the project browser.

I just deleted everything and redownloaded from Git today to get the latest files and match your setup. So now, we have the same files. But, compilation still fails for me, with the same errors as before.

Amazon FreeRTOS	"Re: No luck compiling PIC32MZEF demo in MPLAB X v5.10 with XC32 v2.15
I have successfully reproduced the problem. Two considerations:

First, there is a path length limit in XC32 on Windows. For this project, the various nested driver and BSP subdirectories can cause you to come close to, if not over, that limit. Therefore, try making the base path of your repo clone as short as possible. 

(The most extreme example, I suppose, being something like:)
git clone https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos c:\M

Second, as you already know, aside from the above, v2.10 appears to work. A cursory analysis of the errors reported by v2.15 suggests that it may have become more sensitive to certain violations of the C standard. We're working on confirming."
Amazon FreeRTOS	"ESP32 Greengrass
Hi,

I have problems connecting to the greengrass device. 

I have functional greengrass core with multiple devices on it and successfully sending data between each other. 

I wanted to connect esp32 to it. 
My steps were: Created new thing inside greengrass group by adding device. Used 1 click configurations etc. I downloaded certificates. Used CertificateConfigurator.html to create aws_clientcredential_keys.h . Setup endpoint and wifi settings. All setup was done using a cloned freertos repo. 

I redeployed greengrass core which included new esp32 device thing. 

I successfully, did MQTTEchoDemo. Device was publishing to the cloud. 

But when I comment out mqttechodemo and un-commented greengrass discovery demo. It fails to connect.
Did I missed any steps? I am not sure where things are going wrong.
Thanks

Hello,

It looks like in the first log, you are unable to connect to any of the addresses returned by AWS IoT.  Can you check that the GG core is online?

In the second log, it looks like you can connect, but get disconnected upon initiating an MQTT connection.
Can you check that GG subscriptions and your AWS IoT policy are configured correctly?

For subscriptions, can you try # (all topics), just to ensure that the subscriptions are not the issue.

A few other things to check on your core:
In your greengrass/ folder, is there a crash.log file?  This means your core crashed some time ago.
In greengrass/configuration/group, make sure that group.json is correct.  The ARN must match the group ARN on AWS IoT.
Also make sure that greengrass/configuration/config.json is correct.

An example config.json:
{
    ""coreThing"": {
        ""caPath"": ""root-certificate.pem"",
        ""certPath"": ""xxxx-certificate.pem.crt.txt"",

Thanks,

So I couldn't find any crash log, and I would like to believe that greengrass is functioning ok, because I have other devices connected to that publishing and subscribing works. And new greengrass deployments go down successfully. config.json seems to be good too. 

The only other detail I could tell that Core connectivity was set to find endpoints automatically, and inside Core endpoints I have multiple IP addresses. But from debugging it seems that it finds the core. 

for Subscription i did ""#"" for the topics. And deployed this update, rebooted esp32 and still same results.

My conclusion was that with debugging enabled it was success most of the time. but but with debugging disabled it was 0% success, maybe it's all just a coincidence. 

I write firmware with ""make erase_flash all flash monitor -j9"" command

Sometime it just fails to connect to the AP. I would like to write off most of these errors to bad wifi. We are using CloudTrax to mesh wifi around the office, but it's horrible and we planning to replace it. 
I did not change anything else in the code but the enable metrics or debugging and just reset device like a million times.

Now even with debugging enable I just get.

Could #define mqttconfigENABLE_METRICS    ( 1 )

be affecting this or it was just a coincidence?
Could all this be just our wifi problems?

Amazon FreeRTOS	"ESP32 OTA + Code Signature - E (###) ota_pal: signature verification failed
I have followed the OTA setup procedures for the ESP32 with much success but am having issues with the code signature verification. I am able to successfully download all of the blocks but the update is failed due to the following error:

E (5320617) ota_pal: signature verification failed

The problem stems from a lack of understanding of how we are intended to properly integrate the signature keys into the esp firmware build for verification. I have created the code sign certificate following this https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/ota-code-sign-cert-esp.html. 

I then included the cert that I created into aws_ota_codesigner_certificate.h as outlined here https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/ota-download-freertos.html. I followed the same formatting as recommended for the Microchip Curiosity PIC32MZEF with the new lines as quotes. So that it looked like the following:

static const char signingcredentialSIGNING_CERTIFICATE_PEM[] = ""-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----/n""
""MIIBVjCB/aA######################################################wwT/n""
""YWRyaWF######################################################EwMTAyMDUy/n""

""EwY######################################################1hDe/n""
""Cip1######################################################r/6U/n""
""w##########H1Q==/n""
""-----END CERTIFICATE-----"";

(I have replaced most of the key here with a random number of hashes for obvious reasons)

I have also tried the key as a single line with similar results.
My best guess as to what is going wrong is that I do not know what the proper ""Pathname of code signing certificate on device"" is when creating a code signing profile for the IOT job for the ESp32. I have tried ""ecdsasigner.crt"", ""/"", and ""signingcredentialSIGNING_CERTIFICATE_PEM."" 

Similarly, I put ""/"" for the ""Pathname of firmware image on device."" I assume that any input here would be okay since it is just needed to allow me to click next (the box should be optional in the form but it is not).

Any help would be much appreciated. I can also provide any additional information that is pertinent. Thanks!"

I am getting the signature verification failed also.  I have triple checked the procedure.  I believe the signingcredentialSIGNING_CERTIFICATE_PEM[] constant I'm using is OK.
When you had success, which code signing platform did you use when creating the OTA job? (ESP-WROVER-KIT or ESP32-DevKitC).  I'm unclear why they would be different - they are both SHA256WITHECDSA.
Did using ""/"" as the ""Pathname of firmware image on device."" work OK? (I also assume it doesn't matter).
Do you have other suggestions for things I should check or verification I should do?
I am using a ESP32 version 0 (over a year old) - would the version make a difference?  What hardware did you run your OTA on?

Amazon FreeRTOS	"Re: ESP32 OTA ""Job in self test but platform state is not!""
Hello,

It looks like the OTA image self-test fails, which causes a rollback.

Can you check that the OTA image you are downloading has a version number greater than the image on your device?

Also, which version of Amazon FreeRTOS are you using?  We have recently made some fixes to improve the reliability of OTA, so please make sure you are using the latest version."
Amazon FreeRTOS	"Re: ESP32 OTA ""Job in self test but platform state is not!""
Thanks, I managed to have a successful OTA.

Ok, So today I downloaded the newest version from github. 

Configured credentials. did,  make erase_flash
then make flash monitor -j9
. incremented the build number in fw version. make all
 Uploaded newest bin, did all jazz in the console and it worked. 

But I am sure I was increment-ing build version before, because I did like 10 tries of different things and and code I was using was from this week too.
But I noticed one difference.
So after some unsuccessful tries (few things that I was changing were ""Pathname of firmware image on device"" field in ota from example /device/update to just having ""/"".)
In debugging window I started to have an error about partitions. 
E (108) boot: ota data partition invalid and no factory, will try all partitions
 


Even after flashing new firmware this error existed, but after doing make erase_flash, and then flashing new firmware it went away and OTA was success.
