JavaScript Development	"AWS Cognito Authentication of user not working
Hello 

I have created the cognito user Pool and trying to  Register my user through simple HTML Registration page where my user is sign up but after sign up I am getting verification code. and I need to Authenticate that user so that after authentication I will be able to verify my user through the OTP code sent on my Registered mail Id.

JavaScript Development	"Resend Temporary Password from client-side
I working on a scenario when the user never got (or lost) the email with the temporary password. Now common sense will drive the user to the ""forgot password"" process. But here, he'll get an error saying ""User password cannot be reset in the current state."" What now? I'm trying to find a way to re-send the email with the temporary password FROM the client-side. 

I know there's the option of AdminCreateUser with ""MessageAction"": ""RESEND"" but that involves the back-end and I would prefer keeping this logic in a component in client-side (where the rest of the authentication logic already is). 

I've been trying with the method ""resendConfirmationCode"" of CognitoUser but I get a ""NotAuthorizedException"" error with the message ""Can't resend confirmation code for this user""

Every other post I've read regarding this very scenario ultimately proposes the AdminCreateUser option without even trying to explain why ""resendConfirmationCode"" doesn't work.  

Even if it can't be done, any help with this issue will be greatly appreciated.

JavaScript Development	"Signiature Version 4 Test Suite Inconsistency
The AWS Signature Version 4 Test Suite from Amazon consists of 24 tests.  Each test consists of 5 files:
(1) Request (.req) , (2) Canonical Request (.creq), (3) String to Sign (.sts), (4) the correct Authorization header
(.authz) and, finally, (5) the Signed Request (.sreq)  showing the original request with the Authorization header in
context.

In 22 of the 24 tests, in accordance with the specification, the last line of the String to Sign file is the SHA-256 digest
of the Canonical Request file.  This is no surprise.  The spec says that the last line of the String to Sign is supposed to be a hash of the Canonical Request, and in the test suite, SHA-256 is the chosen hash in all cases.

In 2 of the tests, this is not the case.  Those two tests are (1) post-x-www-form-urlencoded-parameters; and (2) post-x-www-form-urlencoded.   

Why is this?  Is it an error in the test suite?  

This is not just nit-picking.  I happen to have a use-case which is similar to the two test suite examples.  My code works for ALL the test suite examples, except for the two cases which are similar to my actual use case, and I cannot get my code to work.   It is a common case.

JavaScript Development	"Re: Lambda Nodejs
Hello
When your lambda function gets called the first time, it is a cold start. Meaning AWS needs to allocate where will it run and separate the memory and all the background process needed to run it. Once you run it, AWS keeps your function online for a while before releasing the memory and everything else.
So in the case of your function, calling it multiple consecutive times just adds to the list Array and that's why you see the result as

Hello
Recursion is a big issue because it consumes too much memory and runs for long time which in turn becomes a bottleneck and increased costs
Depending on what you are trying to do, you could put objects in SQS or S3 and then trigger a lambda call.  So each lambda call does only one thing, runs in parallel, and there is no recursion.

JavaScript Development	"AWS SDK for JS in Browser with a CognitoUser instead of IAM credentials?
Greetings,

I have a browser app that interacts with S3. Since it was mostly an in-house tool, after handling authenticating to an API, it directly received the ID and secret for a very restricted IAM user which was then used to setup the AWS SDK in the browser.

I am now trying to change that app to use Cognito for authentication. I wound up using AWS Amplify just to handle the authentication part, and now I'm trying to figure out if there's a way of using the credentials I get from Cognito to setup the AWS JavaScript SDK and replicate the same functionality from that point on. (The way Amplify currently handles interaction with S3 does not cover all my needs)

Is there a way of doing this? Alternatively, if I can use only the JS SDK (no Amplify) to login a user via Cognito, that is also preferable to me.

Thank you."

My application has to authenticate with 2 services (one of which is AWS Cognito) before proceeding.  After successful authentication, I attempt to get the groups for that user but am returned with UserNotFoundException. This was interesting as I had just authenticated with the same user credentials and the user is clearly in the pool.

JavaScript Development	"Writing files to AWS Elastic Beanstalk at Runtime
I have developed a web application with a Node.js backend on a local machine using Webstorm IDE. Among other things, the application creates a new unique folder and writes 7 javascript (.js) files to this folder during runtime each time a user requests a new account. Everything works properly in the local development environment.

When the application is uploaded and deployed to AWS Elastic Beanstalk, and a new user is requested though the application web page, I am receiving the following 404 (Not Found) error in the browser's Developer, JavaScript Console. The same error appears for each of the 7 files. The number 1541877962401 is the unique folder name generated by the application when a user requests a new account and user.js is one of the 7 javascript files copied to this newly created folder. savedUser is an existing folder in the file structure and is not created during runtime.

I am guessing that the application does not have the correct permissions to create the folder and/or files in AWS?

Within the context of the Elastic Beanstalk environment, what is the best method to create a folder and copy javascript files to this folder during runtime? It is fairly easy to restructure the location of the folder and the files within it in the development environment so as to match the ASW EB environment. Reengineering the application to store the contents of these files in an AWS MySQL database engine would take a lot more work.

Bye the way, these 7 files are not tmp files and they are not config files...

Thanks..."
JavaScript Development	"Re: Writing files to AWS Elastic Beanstalk at Runtime
Hi,

I am going to assume this is a Node.js ElasticBeanstalk environment.
How do you write/copy those files and where? If you use a node module, like fs for example, you should be able to log what is going on.
Since this is working in your local environment I assume you are mounting the new routes to be accessible by your users.

Going forward you probably need to think about several aspects. If this is a load balanced EB environment then you are generating those files just in one of the instances so when somebody hits the load balancer there is a chance they are not going to hit the same instance always.
Another thing to keep in mind is that instances can be terminated, for a variety of reasons, so if you are trying to maintain any kind of state, you should be doing that outside of the instances themselves.
I am not sure about the scope of your application but copying files for any user that hits your application is not a scalable solution, you may have to think of different strategies.

Best regards
Emanuel"
JavaScript Development	"Re: Writing files to AWS Elastic Beanstalk at Runtime
Hi, thank you for your response.  And even though I am an experienced developer this is my first AWS deployment.  Let me address each of your questions in turn:
1. Yes, this is a Node.js Elastic Beanstalk environment.  I will look at the BS logs to confirm that what I think is happening is in fact happening.  I did include the error message that I am seeing through the browser's Developer, JavaScript Console which is basically that the application either can't see the newly created file or that the files are not being created in the first place. 
2. Yes, the folder and files are generated using the node.js file system module.  Each time a user requests a new account 1) a new unique folder (1541877962401 in my example) is created and 2) the 7 javascript files are copied from 7 startup files in the application into the newly created folder.  These 7 files are then updated by users through the application interface as more information is required.  All of these files are located in the root directory in a folder entitled 'data'.
3. Yes I am using a load balanced environment which I set up through the EB Configuration page.  Very good point and agree entirely.  Separation of the business logic, or data, from the application logic is a concept that I am quite familiar with.  This separation is also important when updating the application.  Can you give me some direction as to how this can be done?  It sounds to me like this is at the core of my problem?
4. Yes I agree, given that these files are really data files, they need to be stored outside of the instance itself for all the reasons you have indicated.  
5. Fully understand that you do not have a high-level view of the application, but scalability is not an issue.  Suffice it to say that when one user creates an account there will be a number of other users that utilize that account.

Looks like what this comes down to is how and where do I locate the 'data' files in an AWS BS environment that is independent of the instance?  I am guessing this will be on a separate AWS server?  If you can point me in the right direction that would be very helpful.

Once again thanks for your help.

JavaScript Development	"Re: Writing files to AWS Elastic Beanstalk at Runtime
Hi,

Thank you for the detailed observations, they definitely help building a clearer picture.

1. You need to look at the logs on the server side, as the browser console messages will not tell you much as you can probably have determined by now. I think this should be relatively straightforward.
You can retrieve the server logs from the EB console.
2. My understanding, at this point is, that this is some sort of working directory for the user. What happens with it when the user is done editing? Do you save the state? Do you remove the files? Can the user continue at a later time?
3,4&5. I need a bit more information about how your application handles the state of those files in relation to the user (see the questions above). Based on the information gathered so far, I think it would be a good idea to store this data in AWS S3, a storage service. That would allow you to process those files independent of the EB instances.The changes to your app will be relatively straightforward.
Depending on the answer on question 2, there might be other things you may want to consider.

Best regards
Emanuel"
JavaScript Development	"Re: Writing files to AWS Elastic Beanstalk at Runtime
Sure thing, yes I am aware of how to access the log files within the EB Console. I will send a copy of the node.log and error.log at the end of this response.
To answer your first question, when the user completes their changes, the results are updated to the files.  The files are maintained, and no there is no programmatic means to remove them.  The user can, and will need to, make additional updates at a later time on an ongoing basis.
I will definitely check out the AWS S3 storage service. It sounds like this will allow me to process these files independent of the EB instances which I think is what is needed.  Changes to the application should be straightforward and limited to changing the path where the files are saved.  All data files are located in this one data folder.

This is helpful.  Gives me somewhere to focus. If you have additional suggestions, as always they will be appreciated.  Many thanks..."
JavaScript Development	"Re: Writing files to AWS Elastic Beanstalk at Runtime
Hi, as you suggested, it looks like Amazon S3 is the correct solution.  Amazon recommends that you use the aws-sdk module to access S3 buckets.  I am quite familiar with using modules within node.js.  I even found some code off of the aws development center that imports an aws-sdk module, instantiates a new bucket object, creates the bucket and copies a data object into the bucket.  Looks promising. Thanks again.

P.S. I'm going to mark this question as answered.

Cheers man..."
JavaScript Development	"Re: Writing files to AWS Elastic Beanstalk at Runtime
Hi,

Sorry for the delay in response.
I am glad that you were able to move in the right direction with your application. Yes, you should use the AWS SDK to interact with S3 and make sure to assign the appropriate IAM role to your EC2 fleet.
There is one point that is missing though: you mentioned your users are able to save the state of their work and resume at a later point in time. How do you allow that, do you use some sort of database? And how are they logging into your App?

Best regards
Emanuel"
JavaScript Development	"Re: Writing files to AWS Elastic Beanstalk at Runtime
Hi, not a problem.  One nice thing about a discussion forum is that you can respond to it when it's convenient to you not the other way around.

I'm looking at both Amazon S3 and DynamoDB as possible data solutions.  As far as I can make out, Amazon S3 is a storage service while DynamoDB is a nosql database service.  One drawback of the nosql solution would be that I would need to rewrite the application data interfaces.  This would take some effort but I think is doable.  Right now the application uses proprietary, i.e. I designed it, data storage based on the JSON file format.

Having said that I like the fact that I can download dynamoDB to my local development computer and in the process have a development environment that mirrors the aws production environment. This is a major plus to me.

Suggestions or comments?

Cheers..."
JavaScript Development	"Re: Writing files to AWS Elastic Beanstalk at Runtime
If your storage of user data is JSON-based, DynamoDB feels like a natural fit for your app.
You will need to make some changes but those are rather straightforward and I think it will pay off quickly.

JavaScript Development	"Node.js + Amazon Linix + Single Instance + Nginx HTTPS failure
Problem and Errors
I'm trying to configure HTTPS for my Single Instance Elastic Beanstalk Node.js server using LetsEncrypt certificates.  I've set it up according to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/https-singleinstance-nodejs.html with some slight tweeks.  The HTTP -> HTTPS redirect is working, but I get a '<URL> unexpectedly closed the connection' and ERR_CONNECTION_CLOSED page when visiting the site in Chrome.

Nginx Configuration
See contents of .ebextensions/https-instance.config below (minus the indentation...).  The only difference between this and the Amazon recommended config file is that I'm pulling the Cert/Key directly from the /etc/letsencrypt directory rather than having this file generate them for me.  After looking at a bunch of forums, this doesn't seem like it should cause issues.  I've obviously confirmed that that the LetsEncrypt generation was successful and that the files are actually there.  I should also note that my DNS is Namecheap, and I have 3 A records pointing to the instance (root, www, and wildcard).

I am trying to implement an app which handles authentication with Cognito and then allows users to upload data to an S3 bucket.

I know how to handle the uploads using the aws-sdk for JavaScript, but it seems to me that now the recommended way to handle in-browser direct interaction with AWS services is with AWS Amplify. 

First question: Is this the case? Is it at allpossible to handle Cognito authentication using the aws-sdk for JavaScript or do I have to use Amplify?

I have managed to handle log-in (including changing password) correctly, using Amplify's Auth class, and now I am trying to handle the S3 upload.

Second question: Do I need to create an Identity Pool to work with Amplify Storage? If so, Why? Is there a work around?

It also seems like ""Storage"" updates files in one of three categories (public, private, etc). 

Third question: Is there a way to prevent this? To upload in a more free-form manner?

Finally, using the aws-sdk, I get events that keep track of upload progress, allowing me to present this information to the users.

Fourth question: Is there any such functionality with AWS Amplify?

Okay, so by some carefully placed console.logs I was able to determine that the response was sent before the promise was finished.  Therefor the response.say didn't work.

JavaScript Development	"Unknown error, the response body from fetch is undefined-Auth.confirmSignIn
Describe the bug
I am trying to send the verification code received by the user to confirm the signIn, I have the SMS_MFA enabled. However, I keep getting this error Unknown error, the response body from fetch is: undefined and thats all I get, there is nothing else to help me understand what the error is about. And everything else is working fine, I call signIn, signUp, confirmSignUp and resendSignUp, they all work fine. The problem is only with confirmSignIn and I have no idea what it could be, I already researched online, but had no success. Another strange thing that happens, when I enter the wrong code, it shows me the 'CodeMismatchException', but it fails with 'Unknown error' when code is the right one. PS: I already have cognito configured to work with SMS MFA

To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
I just installed aws-amplify and started using Auth according to the docs, everything else works fine, it's just when I call confirmSignIn

Expected behavior
Receive a successful response when the correct code is sent for verification.

Smartphone (please complete the following information):
The problem happens in android and iOS

Additional context
I'm using:
react-native version 0.55.4
aws-amplify version ^1.0.11

Code
I have a file where a call all the Auth functions and export them

export const confirmSignIn = (cognitoUser, code) => Auth.confirmSignIn(cognitoUser, code, 'SMS_MFA');

Then I call that confirmSignIn function from a different file

confirmSignIn(cognitoUser, code).then((userSession) => {
         console.log(userSession);

I have a lambda function which uses 'request' to get a stream of a file by URL and suppose to upload it to a bucket on s3. It is working perfectly on my local machine using node but not inside the lambda. After running the lambda, I have an empty file with the name I wanted.

Stuff you should know

The lambda function is async
The node version is 8.10
In the example you see putObject, but I have also tried with upload
Even when adding a manual sleep of 90-120 seconds to let the lambda run, the file is not uploaded
I tried using context.succeed or callback('some result'), but it still did not work properly

JavaScript Development	"How to use an API Gateway JavaScript client SDK with WebPack?
Greetings!

I'm writing a serverless webapp with React + API Gateway + Lambda and it's great!
Currently the API is public and access is not controlled, and I can use very simple AJAX to interact with the API.
Now I'd like to control access to a large part of the API using IAM policies.
From what I understand, I have (at least) these options on the client side to gain access to the protected part of the API

1. Write my own code to sign the requests with Signature Version 4, per  these instructions 
2. Use API Gateway to generate a JavaScript client SDK, include the downloaded SDK .js files, and instantiate the client with credentials, and get the SigV4 signing for free. See  this reference 

My problem is that I'm using WebPack to manage the dependencies in the project. The javascript package that API Gateway generates does not play well with WebPack because of a lack of exports and requires in the included .js files. This is my first three weeks doing JavaScript development, so I'm very much in the deep end with the tooling involved. I've scoured StackOverflow and the rest of the web and haven't found a solution. 

It seems that a similar issue was recently, like in the last month-ish, resolved by AWS with the Cognito JS SDK. See their  blog post.

I've killed several days playing dependency whack-a-mole with export-loaders and import-loaders in WebPack, but there's no end in sight.

Has anyone solved this?

Is there an obvious workaround that I'm missing?

Thanks everyone!"

JavaScript Development	"Signing an API Call to S3 using Security Credentials from Instance Metadata
Hello, 

I am running a Java/Tomcat app on an EC2 instance and need to make GET and PUT calls to S3. I have an IAM role correctly giving permissions to the EC2 to communicate with S3 and I can run CLI commands which work fine. 

My problem is I need to make these calls within the Java app and cannot use the AWS SDK. The Java app allows me to run JavaScript services which is what I am using to make the calls. I created a service that successfully calculates the AWS Signature Version 4, essentially creating presigned url that the SDK will give you in 1 line of code. 

The code works with an actual IAM User (with the exact same permissions as the EC2 IAM Role). But I am trying to use the role instead of the user since our security org will not allow me to use a user in production plus I would have to chage the id and key every 90 days...blah, blah, blah. 

I know I can make calls to http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/ and get the name of my IAM Role, add that to the url and call it again to get an ID, Key, and Token. referenced here: http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/. 

When I use the credentials from the instance metadata, sending the ID and Key from the metadata rather than the IAM User, I receive the error ""InvalidAccessKeyId, The AWS Access Key Id you provided does not exist in our records."" Through some searching, I found I probably needed to send the Token as a header as well. I URI encode the token returned from the instance metadata, add the header to my whole signing calculations. Sending the ID, Key, and Token, I receive the error ""InvalidToken, The provided token is malformed or otherwise invalid."" So I've tried no encoding the token, but that gives me a signature mismatch error. 

I am stuck. I know the IAM role has the correct permissions to talk to S3. I know the code calculates the signature correctly using an IAM User ID and Key. But I receive errors as soon as I start using the instance metadata. 

Has anyone calculated their own AWS signature v4 using the instance metadata? What am I missing?

Thanks,
Chris"

lambda does not print the above log.

I am not able to figure out the issue. Can someone help me out!"
JavaScript Development	"Re: Not able to invoke simple lamba function
There are 2 types of errors which could occur here when invoking a Lambda with RequestResponse, both of which you need to catch differently: connectivity errors (e.g. network issue connecting to the Lambda API) and functional errors (e.g. bad request).
I don't think your log statement would catch connectivity issues as you don't catch a failed promise.

Try something like the following to debug further:

return lambda.invoke(params).promise().then(res => {
   if (res.FunctionError) {
       // Functional error (e.g. bad request)
        console.log(`FunctionError returned. Error details: ${res.Payload}`);
        return;
    }
    // Success
    console.log('Success': res.Payload);
}).catch(err => {
   // Connectivity issue
   console.log(""Error invoking Lambda: "", err);
});"
JavaScript Development	"Re: Not able to invoke simple lamba function
Thanks for the reply Paul!

Well, My code snippet was working. I replaced console.log with context.done(null, res). And the response was being displayed.

Also, InvocationType was set to RequestResponse.

JavaScript Development	"Problems with invoking lambda and returning async api call
Hi all.

I have this function that I use to get an access token from another lambda function. I then query google api to get some photo data. I then want to return this photo data from the function. The problem is that I can't seem to actually return any data from my function as written, or any other way with promises/async/await. 

I get this log error: 
{
  ""errorMessage"": ""Converting circular structure to JSON"",
  ""errorType"": ""TypeError"",
  ""stackTrace"": []
}


Here is my function:

const request = require('request-promise');
const aws = require('aws-sdk');
const lambda = new aws.Lambda({
  region: 'us-east-1'
});   
 
const params = {
    FunctionName: ""getTokenThingy"", 
    InvocationType: ""RequestResponse"", 
    LogType: ""Tail""
};
 
exports.handler = async (event, context) => {
    console.log(""Starting invoke of function"");
    console.log(""Invoking access function"");
    // Get access token
    return await lambda.invoke(params, async (err, data) => {
        if (err) {
            console.log(error);
            return ""test"";
        }
        else {
            console.log(""Retrieved data from payload""); 
            let payloadReponse = JSON.parse(data.Payload);
            const accessToken = payloadReponse.body.accessToken;
 
            console.log(""Access token "" + accessToken);
            
            let photoResult = await libraryApiGetPhotos(accessToken);
            console.log(""Got photo results: "" + photoResult.length);
            return ""test"";
            
        }   
    });
}
 
async function libraryApiGetPhotos(accessToken) {
    let photos = [];
    let error = null;
    const bodyParams = { 
        ""filters"": {
            ""mediaTypeFilter"" : { 
                ""mediaTypes"": [ ""PHOTO""]
            }
        }
    };
    let options = { 
        method: 'POST',
        uri: process.env.googlePhotosAPIEndpoint + process.env.mediaListSearchAffix,
        body: bodyParams,
        json: true,
        auth: { 'bearer' : accessToken }
    }
 
    return request(options)
        .then( (parsedBody) => {
            console.log(""Getting media items"");
            photos = photos.concat(parsedBody.mediaItems);
            console.log(""Count of photos: "" + photos.length);
            return photos;
        }).catch( (err) => {
            error = err.error.error ||
                {name: err.name, code: err.statusCode, message: err.message};
            console.log(error);
        });
}


All the logs occur in the correct order but there is no response at the end and just that error. I have tried varied different ways of converting to promises instead of await/async with no luck. Would love some suggestions.

JavaScript Development	"How to get new token from Cognito from the frontend?
I have a react app and I am using Cognito to handle user's authentication. I need to know how do I make a call to Cognito with the refresh token so that it gives me back a new token?

JavaScript Development	"How to get Cognito User Id with acces Token or Cognito user sub from IAM
Hi,

I am using NodeJS 8.1 for a lambda function called by Alexa.
I am also using the Swift SDK.
I am using Cognito Identity to identify users though the iOS app and the account is linked with the Alexa skill.

The problem is that we use the cognito user-sub to store data under an S3 bucket. 

We want to limit acces to cognito user with the key {cognito-identity.amazonaws.com:sub} which, in fact is the user ID and not the sub. 

Actually, from the alexa lambda function I am using the GET /oauth2/userInfo service, which only returns the user-sub and which is the only API I found I can use with the accesToken delivered by the account linking.

Is there a way to get the user ID from the alexa Lambda function or to get the user sub to restrict the policy under the IAM console ?"
