AWS Marketplace	"Can't connect to SQL Server 2014 Express AMI
Hello,

When I use the RDP session I only see one Command Prompt window.  I don't see a Windows UI.  Is this AMI bad?

Additionally, I'm trying to remotely connect to the SQL Server that is provided by this AMI.  I have all ports inbound ports open but I can't figure out how to remotely connect and configure it.  I can connect to it locally in the RDP session.

Is there a default port for this SQL instance?

The AMI contains Windows Server Core Install : https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh846323(v=vs.85).aspx, so seeing only Command Prompt is expected.

By default the network services are disabled on SQL Server. Need to restart network services to be able to reach SQL Server (port 1443) from outside server.

Following is the way to enable the networking service:
1. Use netstat -a -b to verify port 1433 is not LISTENING
2. Run C:\Windows\SysWOW64\SQLServerManager12.msc from cmd.exe to open SQL Server 2014 Configuration Manager
3. Follow Steps in Microsoft Article   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/enable-or-disable-a-server-network-protocol?view=sql-server-2017  to check the network status, enable, and restart SQL Server
4. After SQL Server restart, check for port status using netstat -a -b
5. Should be able to connect from other servers after that, off course assuming the port is allowed.

Hope this helps."

Perfect response!  Thank you so much.  That's very helpful."

Is there a set of default credentials for remote server management?

I can telnet to the port 1433 and that responds so I know the server is running.  I'm not able to figure out the default credentials using the remote management server tool so I can't log in to begin adding databases, etc."
AWS Marketplace	"How to use SageMaker model from marketplace with GPU instances
Hi, I subscribed to the GluonCV YOLOv3 Object Detector https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-5jlvp43tsn3ny model at the Marketplace but when I try to create a batch transform job with this model on a GPU accelerated instance type (ml.p2.*) the console returns me the following error: ""Requested instance type cannot work with all containers of the model"". How can I use this model with GPU instances?"
AWS Marketplace	"Re: How to use SageMaker model from marketplace with GPU instances
Currently, the listing https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-5jlvp43tsn3ny does not support GPUs. You can find the instance types currently supported for batch transform on the ""Subscribe to this software” page of the listing, which appears when you click on the “Continue to Subscribe” button on the listing page."
AWS Marketplace	"Is CustomerIdentifier always unique per user?
In the following guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/configuring-your-saas-application-to-accept-new-customers.html), ResolveCustomer is used to get CustomerIdentifier and ProductCode.

Is CustomerIdentifier is always associated to a single AWS user?

I.e. does CustomerIdentifier always mean an individual, or can it also resolve to an organization that individual belongs to? In other words, can two different AWS users ever have the same CustomerIdentifier?

Thank you,
Alex"
AWS Marketplace	"Re: Is CustomerIdentifier always unique per user?
CustomerIdentifier is associated with a single AWS account. If multiple users share the same AWS account (through IAM roles, for example), yes, they will share the same CustomerIdentifier."
