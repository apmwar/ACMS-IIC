Amazon Lambda,Certificate Errors When Using an SDK     
Amazon Lambda,"Because AWS SDKs use the CA certificates from your computer, changes to the certificates on the AWS servers can cause connection failures when you attempt to use an SDK. You can prevent these failures by keeping your computer's CA certificates and operating system up-to-date. If you encounter this issue in a corporate environment and do not manage your own computer, you might need to ask an administrator to assist with the update process. The following list shows minimum operating system and Java versions:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Microsoft Windows versions that have updates from January 2005 or later installed contain at least one of the required CAs in their trust list.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Mac OS X 10.4 with Java for Mac OS X 10.4 Release 5 (February 2007), Mac OS X 10.5 (October 2007), and later versions contain at least one of the required CAs in their trust list.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (March 2007), 6, and 7 and CentOS 5, 6, and 7 all contain at least one of the required CAs in their default trusted CA list.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Java 1.4.2_12 (May 2006), 5 Update 2 (March 2005), and all later versions, including Java 6 (December 2006), 7, and 8, contain at least one of the required CAs in their default trusted CA list.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"When accessing the AWS Lambda management console or AWS Lambda API endpoints, whether through browsers or programmatically, you will need to ensure your client machines support any of the following CAs:     "

Amazon Lambda,Starfield Services Root Certificate Authority - G2     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Starfield Class 2 Certification Authority     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Root certificates from the first two authorities are available from Amazon Trust Services, but keeping your computer up-to-date is the more straightforward solution. To learn more about ACM-provided certificates, see AWS Certificate Manager FAQs.     "
Amazon Lambda,"In this Getting Started exercise you create a Lambda function using the AWS Lambda console. Next, you manually invoke the Lambda function using sample event data. AWS Lambda executes the Lambda function and returns results. You then verify execution results, including the logs that your Lambda function created and various CloudWatch metrics.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,To create a Lambda function     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Open the AWS Lambda console.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Choose Create a function.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For Function name, enter my-function.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Choose Create function.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Lambda creates a Node.js function and an execution role that grants the function permission to upload logs. Lambda assumes the execution role when you invoke your function, and uses it to create credentials for the AWS SDK and to read data from event sources.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Use the Designer     
Amazon Lambda,The Designer lets you configure triggers and view permissions.     
Amazon Lambda,"Choose Amazon CloudWatch Logs to view the log-related permissions that the execution role grants the function. When you add a trigger or configure features that require additional permissions, Lambda modifies to the function's execution role or resource-based policy to grant the minimum required access. To view these policies, choose the key icon.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Choose my-function in the designer to return to the function's code and configuration. For scripting languages, Lambda includes sample code that returns a success response. You can edit your function code with the embedded AWS Cloud9 editor as long as your source code doesn't exceed the 3 MB limit.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Invoke the Lambda Function     
Amazon Lambda,Invoke your Lambda function using the sample event data provided in the console.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,To invoke a function     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"In the upper right corner, choose Test.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"In the Configure test event page, choose Create new test event and in Event template, leave the default Hello World option. Enter an Event name and note the following sample event template:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,{     
Amazon Lambda,"  ""key3"": ""value3"",     "
Amazon Lambda,"  ""key2"": ""value2"",     "
Amazon Lambda,"  ""key1"": ""value1""     "
Amazon Lambda,}     
Amazon Lambda,"You can change key and values in the sample JSON, but don't change the event structure. If you do change any keys and values, you must update the sample code accordingly.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Choose Create and then choose Test. Each user can create up to 10 test events per function. Those test events are not available to other users.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda executes your function on your behalf. The handler in your Lambda function receives and then processes the sample event.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Upon successful execution, view results in the console.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The Execution result section shows the execution status as succeeded and also shows the function execution results, returned by the return statement.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The Summary section shows the key information reported in the Log output section (the REPORT line in the execution log).     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The Log output section shows the log AWS Lambda generates for each execution. These are the logs written to CloudWatch by the Lambda function. The AWS Lambda console shows these logs for your convenience.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note that the Click here link shows logs in the CloudWatch console. The function then adds logs to Amazon CloudWatch in the log group that corresponds to the Lambda function.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Run the Lambda function a few times to gather some metrics that you can view in the next step.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Choose Monitoring. This page shows graphs for the metrics that Lambda sends to CloudWatch.     
Amazon Lambda,"For more information on these graphs, see Monitoring Functions in the AWS Lambda Console.     "
Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda Concepts     
Amazon Lambda,"AWS Lambda lets you run functions in a serverless environment to process events in the language of your choice. Each instance of your function runs in an isolated execution context and processes one event at a time. When it finishes processing the event, it returns a response and Lambda sends it another event. Lambda automatically scales up the number of instances of your function to handle high numbers of events.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Function – A script or program that runs in AWS Lambda. Lambda passes invocation events to your function. The function processes an event and returns a response. For more information, see Working with Lambda Functions.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Runtimes – Lambda runtimes allow functions in different languages to run in the same base execution environment. You configure your function to use a runtime that matches your programming language. The runtime sits in-between the Lambda service and your function code, relaying invocation events, context information, and responses between the two. You can use runtimes provided by Lambda, or build your own. For more information, see AWS Lambda Runtimes.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Layers – Lambda layers are a distribution mechanism for libraries, custom runtimes, and other function dependencies. Layers let you manage your in-development function code independently from the unchanging code and resources that it uses. You can configure your function to use layers that you create, layers provided by AWS, or layers from other AWS customers. For more information, see AWS Lambda Layers     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Event source – An AWS service, such as Amazon SNS, or a custom service, that triggers your function and executes its logic. For more information, see AWS Lambda Event Source Mapping.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Downstream resources – An AWS service, such as DynamoDB tables or Amazon S3 buckets, that your Lambda function calls once it is triggered.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Log streams – While Lambda automatically monitors your function invocations and reports metrics to CloudWatch, you can annotate your function code with custom logging statements that allow you to analyze the execution flow and performance of your Lambda function to ensure it's working properly.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"AWS SAM – A model to define serverless applications. AWS SAM is natively supported by AWS CloudFormation and defines simplified syntax for expressing serverless resources. For more information, see What Is AWS SAM? in the AWS Serverless Application Model Developer Guide.     "
Amazon Lambda,Command Line Tools     
Amazon Lambda,"Install the AWS Command Line Interface to manage and use Lambda functions from the command line. Tutorials in this guide use the AWS CLI, which has commands for all Lambda API actions. Some functionality is not available in the Lambda console and can only be accessed with the AWS CLI or the AWS SDK.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The AWS SAM CLI is a separate command line tool that you can use to manage and test AWS SAM applications. In addition to commands for uploading artifacts and launching AWS CloudFormation stacks that are also available in the AWS CLI, the SAM CLI provides additional commands for validating templates and running applications locally in a Docker container.     "

Amazon Lambda,"Limits for other services, such as AWS Identity and Access Management, Amazon CloudFront (Lambda@Edge), and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud, can impact your Lambda functions. For more information, see AWS Service Limits and Using AWS Lambda with Other Services.     "
Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda Permissions     
Amazon Lambda,"You can use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to manage access to the Lambda API and resources like functions and layers. For users and applications in your account that use Lambda, you manage permissions in a permissions policy that you can apply to IAM users, groups, or roles. To grant permissions to other accounts or AWS services that use your Lambda resources, you use a policy that applies to the resource itself.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"A Lambda function also has a policy, called an execution role, that grants it permission to access AWS services and resources. At a minimum, your function needs access to Amazon CloudWatch Logs for log streaming. If you use AWS X-Ray to trace your function, or your function accesses services with the AWS SDK, you grant it permission to call them in the execution role. Lambda also uses the execution role to get permission to read from event sources when you use an event source mapping to trigger your function.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If your function needs network access to a resource like a relational database that isn't accessible through AWS APIs or the internet, configure it to connect to your VPC.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Use resource-based policies to give other accounts and AWS services permission to use your Lambda resources. Lambda resources include functions, versions, aliases, and layer versions. Each of these resources has a permissions policy that applies when the resource is accessed, in addition to any policies that apply to the user. When an AWS service like Amazon S3 calls your Lambda function, the resource-based policy gives it access.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"To manage permissions for users and applications in your accounts, use the managed policies that Lambda provides, or write your own. The Lambda console uses multiple services to get information about your function's configuration and triggers. You can use the managed policies as-is, or as a starting point for more restrictive policies.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You can restrict user permissions by the resource an action affects and, in some cases, by additional conditions. For example, you can specify a pattern for the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a function that requires a user to include their user name in the name of functions that they create. Additionally, you can add a condition that requires that the user configure functions to use a specific layer to, for example, pull in logging software. For the resources and conditions that are supported by each action, see Resources and Conditions.     "

Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda Execution Role     
Amazon Lambda,"An AWS Lambda function's execution role grants it permission to access AWS services and resources. You provide this role when you create a function, and Lambda assumes the role when your function is invoked. You can create an execution role for development that has permission to send logs to Amazon CloudWatch, and upload trace data to AWS X-Ray.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,To create an execution role     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Open the roles page in the IAM console.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Choose Create role.     
Amazon Lambda,

Amazon Lambda,"Permissions – AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole, AWSXrayWriteOnlyAccess     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Role name – lambda-role     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You can add or remove permissions from a function's execution role at any time, or configure your function to use a different role. Add permissions for any services that your function calls with the AWS SDK, and for services that Lambda uses to enable optional features.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The following managed policies provide permissions that are required to use Lambda features:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole – Permission to upload logs to CloudWatch.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,AWSLambdaKinesisExecutionRole – Permission to read events from an Amazon Kinesis data stream or consumer.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,AWSLambdaDynamoDBExecutionRole – Permission to read records from an Amazon DynamoDB stream.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,AWSLambdaSQSQueueExecutionRole – Permission to read a message from an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole – Permission to manage elastic network interfaces to connect your function to a VPC.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,AWSXrayWriteOnlyAccess – Permission to upload trace data to X-Ray.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"When you use an event source mapping to invoke your function, Lambda uses the execution role to read event data. For example, an event source mapping for Amazon Kinesis reads events from a data stream and sends them to your function in batches. You can use event source mappings with the following services:     "

Amazon Lambda,"In addition to the managed policies, the Lambda console provides templates for creating a custom policy that has the permissions related to additional use cases. When you create a function, you can choose to create a new execution role with permissions from one or more templates. These templates are also applied automatically when you create a function from a blueprint, or when you configure options that require access to other services. Example templates are available in this guide's GitHub repository.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Using Resource-based Policies for AWS Lambda     
Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda supports resource-based permissions policies for Lambda functions and layers. Resource-based policies let you grant usage permission to other accounts on a per-resource basis. You also use a resource-based policy to allow an AWS service to invoke your function.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For Lambda functions, you can grant an account permission to invoke or manage a function. You can add multiple statements to grant access to multiple accounts, or let any account invoke your function. For functions that another AWS service invokes in response to activity in your account, you use the policy to grant invoke permission to the service.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For Lambda layers, you use a resource-based policy on a version of the layer to let other accounts use it. In addition to policies that grant permission to a single account or all accounts, for layers, you can also grant permission to all accounts in an organization.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You can only update resource-based policies for Lambda resources within the scope of the AddPermission and AddLayerVersionPermission API actions. You can't author policies for your Lambda resources in JSON, or use conditions that don't map to parameters for those actions.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Resource-based policies apply to a single function, version, alias, or layer version. They grant permission to one or more services and accounts. For trusted accounts that you want to have access to multiple resources, or to use API actions that resource-based policies don't support, you can use cross-account roles.     "

Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"When you add a trigger to your function with the Lambda console, the console updates the function's resource-based policy to allow the service to invoke it. To grant permissions to other accounts or services that aren't available in the Lambda console, use the AWS CLI.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Add a statement with the add-permission command. The simplest resource-based policy statement allows a service to invoke a function. The following command grants Amazon SNS permission to invoke a function named my-function.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,$ aws lambda add-permission --function-name my-function --action lambda:InvokeFunction --statement-id sns \

Amazon Lambda,"This lets Amazon SNS invoke the function, but it doesn't restrict the Amazon SNS topic that triggers the invocation. To ensure that your function is only invoked by a specific resource, specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource with the source-arn option. The following command only allows Amazon SNS to invoke the function for subscriptions to a topic named my-topic.     "
Amazon Lambda,

For Amazon S3, however, the source is a bucket whose ARN doesn't have an account ID in it. It's possible that you could delete the bucket and another account could create a bucket with the same name. Use the account-id option to ensure that only resources in your account can invoke the function.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,$ aws lambda add-permission --function-name my-function --action lambda:InvokeFunction --statement-id s3-account \

Amazon Lambda,Granting Function Access to Other Accounts     
Amazon Lambda,"To grant permissions to another AWS account, specify the account ID as the principal. The following example grants account 210987654321 permission to invoke my-function with the prod alias.     "

Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You can grant cross-account access for any API action that operates on an existing function. For example, you could grant access to lambda:ListAliases to let an account get a list of aliases, or lambda:GetFunction to let them download your function code. Add each permission separately, or use lambda:* to grant access to all actions for the specified function.     "

In addition to common conditions supported by all actions, Lambda defines condition types that you can use to restrict the values of additional parameters on some actions.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For example, the lambda:Principal condition lets you restrict the service or account that a user can grant invocation access to on a function's resource-based policy. The following policy lets a user grant permission to SNS topics to invoke a function named test.     "

When a Lambda function is invoked, AWS Lambda starts executing your code by calling the handler function. AWS Lambda passes any event data to this handler as the first parameter. Your handler should process the incoming event data and may invoke any other functions/methods in your code.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Context – AWS Lambda also passes a  context  object to the handler function, as the second parameter. Via this context object your code can interact with AWS Lambda. For example, your code can find the execution time remaining before AWS Lambda terminates your Lambda function.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"In addition, for languages such as Node.js, there is an asynchronous platform that uses callbacks. AWS Lambda provides additional methods on this context object. You use these context object methods to tell AWS Lambda to terminate your Lambda function and optionally return values to the caller.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Logging – Your Lambda function can contain logging statements. AWS Lambda writes these logs to CloudWatch Logs. Specific language statements generate log entries, depending on the language you use to author your Lambda function code.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Logging is subject to CloudWatch Logs limits. Log data can be lost due to throttling or, in some cases, when the execution context is terminated.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Exceptions – Your Lambda function needs to communicate the result of the function execution to AWS Lambda. Depending on the language you author your Lambda function code, there are different ways to end a request successfully or to notify AWS Lambda an error occurred during execution. If you invoke the function synchronously, then AWS Lambda forwards the result back to the client.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Concurrency – When your function is invoked more quickly than a single instance of your function can process events, Lambda scales by running additional instances. Each instance of your function handles only one request at a time, so you don't need to worry about synchronizing threads or processes. You can, however, use asynchronous language features to process batches of events in parallel, and save data to the /tmp directory for use in future invocations on the same instance.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Your Lambda function code must be written in a stateless style, and have no affinity with the underlying compute infrastructure. Your code should expect local file system access, child processes, and similar artifacts to be limited to the lifetime of the request. Persistent state should be stored in Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, or another cloud storage service. Requiring functions to be stateless enables AWS Lambda to launch as many copies of a function as needed to scale to the incoming rate of events and requests. These functions may not always run on the same compute instance from request to request, and a given instance of your Lambda function may be used more than once by AWS Lambda.

Amazon Lambda,"To create a Lambda function you first create a Lambda function deployment package, a .zip or .jar file consisting of your code and any dependencies. When creating the zip, include only the code and its dependencies, not the containing folder. You will then need to set the appropriate security permissions for the zip package.     "

Amazon Lambda,Permissions Policies on Lambda Deployment Packages     
Amazon Lambda,"Zip packages uploaded with incorrect permissions may cause execution failure. AWS Lambda requires global read permissions on code files and any dependent libraries that comprise your deployment package. To ensure permissions are not restricted to your user account, you can check using the following samples:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Linux/Unix/OSX environments: Use zipinfo as shown in the sample below:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,$ zipinfo test.zip     
Amazon Lambda,Archive:  test.zip     
Amazon Lambda,"Zip file size: 473 bytes, number of entries: 2     "
Amazon Lambda,-r--------  3.0 unx        0 bx stor 17-Aug-10 09:37 exlib.py

Amazon Lambda,"2 files, 234 bytes uncompressed, 163 bytes compressed:  30.3%     "
Amazon Lambda,"The -r-------- indicates that only the file owner has read permissions, which can cause Lambda function execution failures. The following indicates what you would see if there are requisite global read permissions:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,$ zipinfo test.zip     
Amazon Lambda,Archive:  test.zip

Amazon Lambda,"2 files, 234 bytes uncompressed, 163 bytes compressed:  30.3%     "
Amazon Lambda,"To fix this recursively, run the following command:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,$ chmod 644 $(find /tmp/package_contents -type f)     
Amazon Lambda,$ chmod 755 $(find /tmp/package_contents -type d)     
Amazon Lambda,"The first command changes all files in /tmp/package_contents to have read/write permissions to owners, read to group and global.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The second command cascades the same permissions for directories.     
Amazon Lambda,Accessing AWS Resources from a Lambda Function     
Amazon Lambda,"Lambda does not enforce any restrictions on your function logic – if you can code for it, you can run it within a Lambda function. As part of your function, you may need to call other APIs, or access other AWS services like databases.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Accessing AWS Services     
Amazon Lambda,"To access other AWS services, you can use the AWS SDK. AWS Lambda automatically sets the credentials required by the SDK to those of the IAM role associated with your function – you do not need to take any additional steps. For example, here’s sample code using the Python SDK for accessing an S3 object.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,import boto3     
Amazon Lambda,import botocore     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,BUCKET_NAME = 'my-bucket' # replace with your bucket name     
Amazon Lambda,KEY = 'my_image_in_s3.jpg' # replace with your object key     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,s3 = boto3.resource('s3')     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,try:     
Amazon Lambda,"    s3.Bucket(BUCKET_NAME).download_file(KEY, 'my_local_image.jpg')     "
Amazon Lambda,except botocore.exceptions.ClientError as e:     
Amazon Lambda,"    if e.response['Error']['Code'] == ""404"":     "
Amazon Lambda,"        print(""The object does not exist."")     "
Amazon Lambda,    else:     
Amazon Lambda,        raise     
Amazon Lambda,"For convenience, AWS Lambda includes versions of the AWS SDK as part of the execution environment so you don’t have to include it. See AWS Lambda Runtimes for the version of the included SDK. We recommend including your own copy of the AWS SDK for production applications so you can control your dependencies.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Accessing non AWS Services     
Amazon Lambda,"You can include any SDK to access any service as part of your Lambda function. For example, you can include the SDK for Twilio to access information from your Twilio account. You can use AWS Lambda Environment Variables for storing the credential information for the SDKs after encrypting the credentials.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Accessing Private Services or Resources     
Amazon Lambda,"By default, your service or API must be accessible over the public internet for AWS Lambda to access it. However, you may have APIs or services that are not exposed this way. Typically, you create these resources inside Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) so that they cannot be accessed over the public Internet. These resources could be AWS service resources, such as Amazon Redshift data warehouses, Amazon ElastiCache clusters, or Amazon RDS instances. They could also be your own services running on your own EC2 instances. By default, resources within a VPC are not accessible from within a Lambda function.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"AWS Lambda runs your function code securely within a VPC by default. However, to enable your Lambda function to access resources inside your private VPC, you must provide additional VPC-specific configuration information that includes VPC subnet IDs and security group IDs. AWS Lambda uses this information to set up elastic network interfaces (ENIs) that enable your function to connect securely to other resources within your private VPC.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Important     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"AWS Lambda does not support connecting to resources within Dedicated Tenancy VPCs. For more information, see Dedicated VPCs.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"To learn how to configure a Lambda function to access resources within a VPC, see Configuring a Lambda Function to Access Resources in an Amazon VPC     "
Amazon Lambda,Configuring AWS Lambda Functions     
Amazon Lambda,"You can use the AWS Lambda API or console to configure settings on your Lambda functions. Basic function settings include the description, role, and runtime that you specify when you create a function in the Lambda console. You can configure more settings after you create a function, or use the API to set things like the handler name, memory allocation, and security groups during creation.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"To keep secrets out of your function code, store them in the function's configuration and read them from the execution environment during initialization. Environment variables are always encrypted at rest, and can be encrypted in transit as well. Use environment variables to make your function code portable by removing connection strings, passwords, and endpoints for external resources.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Versions and aliases are secondary resources that you can create to manage function deployment and invocation. Publish versions of your function to store its code and configuration as a separate resource that cannot be changed, and create an alias that points to a specific version. Then you can configure your clients to invoke a function alias, and update the alias when you want to point the client to a new version, instead of updating the client.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"As you add libraries and other dependencies to your function, creating and uploading a deployment package can slow down development. Use layers to manage your function's dependencies independently and keep your deployment package small. You can also use layers to share your own libraries with other customers and use publicly available layers with your functions.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"To use your Lambda function with AWS resources in an Amazon VPC, configure it with security groups and subnets to create a VPC connection. Lambda uses elastic network interfaces (ENIs) to create the connection, so you need to ensure that your account has enough ENI capacity to handle the number of connections made as your function scales up under load.

Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Execution role – The IAM role that AWS Lambda assumes when it executes your function.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Description – A description of the function.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Memory – The amount of memory available to the function during execution. Choose an amount between 128 MB and 3,008 MB in 64 MB increments.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Lambda allocates CPU power linearly in proportion to the amount of memory configured. At 1,792 MB, a function has the equivalent of 1 full vCPU (one vCPU-second of credits per second).     "

Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Reserved concurrency applies to the entire function, including all versions and aliases.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Function settings can only be changed on the unpublished version of a function. When you publish a version, code and most settings are locked to ensure a consistent experience for users of that version. Use aliases to propagate configuration changes in a controlled manner.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"To configure functions with the Lambda API, use the following actions.     "
Amazon Lambda,

Amazon Lambda,"For function configuration best practices, see Function Configuration.     "
Amazon Lambda,Managing Concurrency     
Amazon Lambda,"The unit of scale for AWS Lambda is a concurrent execution (see Understanding Scaling Behavior for more details). However, scaling indefinitely is not desirable in all scenarios. For example, you may want to control your concurrency for cost reasons, or to regulate how long it takes you to process a batch of events, or to simply match it with a downstream resource. To assist with this, Lambda provides a concurrent execution limit control at both the account level and the function level.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Account Level Concurrent Execution Limit     
Amazon Lambda,"By default, AWS Lambda limits the total concurrent executions across all functions within a given region to 1000. You can view the account level setting by using the GetAccountSettings API and viewing the AccountLimit object. This limit can be raised as described below:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,To request a limit increase for concurrent executions     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Open the AWS Support Center page, sign in if necessary, and then choose Create case.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For Regarding, select Service Limit Increase.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For Limit Type, choose Lambda, fill in the necessary fields in the form, and then choose the button at the bottom of the page for your preferred method of contact.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Function Level Concurrent Execution Limit     
Amazon Lambda,"By default, the concurrent execution limit is enforced against the sum of the concurrent executions of all functions. The shared concurrent execution pool is referred to as the unreserved concurrency allocation. If you haven’t set up any function-level concurrency limit, then the unreserved concurrency limit is the same as the account level concurrency limit. Any increases to the account level limit have a corresponding increase in the unreserved concurrency limit. You can view the unreserved concurrency allocation for a function by using the GetAccountSettings API or using the AWS Lambda console. Functions that are being accounted against the shared concurrent execution pool will not show any concurrency value when queried using the GetFunctionConfiguration API.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,You can optionally set the concurrent execution limit for a function. You may choose to do this for a few reasons:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The default behavior means a surge of concurrent executions in one function prevents the function you have isolated with an execution limit from getting throttled. By setting a concurrent execution limit on a function, you are reserving the specified concurrent execution value for that function.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Functions scale automatically based on incoming request rate, but not all resources in your architecture may be able to do so. For example, relational databases have limits on how many concurrent connections they can handle. You can set the concurrent execution limit for a function to align with the values of its downstream resources support.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If your function connects to VPC based resources, you must make sure your subnets have adequate address capacity to support the ENI scaling requirements of your function. You can estimate the approximate ENI capacity with the following formula:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Concurrent executions * (Memory in GB / 3 GB)     
Amazon Lambda,Where:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Concurrent execution – This is the projected concurrency of your workload. Use the information in Understanding Scaling Behavior to determine this value.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Memory in GB – The amount of memory you configured for your Lambda function.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,You can set the concurrent execution limit for a function to match the subnet size limits you have.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If you need a function to stop processing any invocations, you can choose to set the concurrency to 0 and throttle all incoming executions.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"By setting a concurrency limit on a function, Lambda guarantees that allocation will be applied specifically to that function, regardless of the amount of traffic processing remaining functions. If that limit is exceeded, the function will be throttled. How that function behaves when throttled will depend on the event source. For more information, see Throttling Behavior.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Concurrency limits can only be set at the function level, not for individual versions. All invocations to all versions and aliases of a given function will accrue towards the function limit.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Reserved vs. Unreserved Concurrency Limits     
Amazon Lambda,"If you set the concurrent execution limit for a function, the value is deducted from the unreserved concurrency pool. For example, if your account's concurrent execution limit is 1000 and you have 10 functions, you can specify a limit on one function at 200 and another function at 100. The remaining 700 will be shared among the other 8 functions.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"AWS Lambda will keep the unreserved concurrency pool at a minimum of 100 concurrent executions, so that functions that do not have specific limits set can still process requests. So, in practice, if your total account limit is 1000, you are limited to allocating 900 to individual functions.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Setting Concurrency Limits Per Function (Console)     
Amazon Lambda,"To set a concurrency limit for your Lambda function using the Lambda console, do the following:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Open the Lambda console Functions page.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Choose a function.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Under the Configuration tab, choose Concurrency. In Reserve concurrency, set the value to the maximum of concurrent executions you want reserved for the function. Note that when you set this value, the Unreserved account concurrency value will automatically be updated to display the remaining number of concurrent executions available for all other functions in the account. Also note that if you want to block invocation of this function, set the value to 0. To remove a dedicated allotment value for this account, choose Use unreserved account concurrency.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Setting Concurrency Limits Per Function (CLI)     
Amazon Lambda,"To set a concurrency limit for your Lambda function using the AWS CLI, do the following:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Use the PutFunctionConcurrency operation and pass in the function name and concurrency limit you want allocated to this function:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,$ aws lambda put-function-concurrency --function-name my-function --reserved-concurrent-executions 100     
Amazon Lambda,"To remove a concurrency limit for your Lambda function using the AWS CLI, do the following:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Use the DeleteFunctionConcurrency operation and pass in the function name:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,$ aws lambda delete-function-concurrency --function-name my-function       
Amazon Lambda,"To view a concurrency limit for your Lambda function using the AWS CLI, do the following:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Use the GetFunction operation and pass in the function name:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,$ aws lambda get-function --function-name my-function       
Amazon Lambda,Setting the per function concurrency can impact the concurrency pool available to other functions. We recommend restricting the permissions to the PutFunctionConcurrency API and DeleteFunctionConcurrency API to administrative users so that the number of users who can make these changes is limited.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Throttling Behavior     
Amazon Lambda,"On reaching the concurrency limit associated with a function, any further invocation requests to that function are throttled, i.e. the invocation doesn't execute your function. Each throttled invocation increases the Amazon CloudWatch Throttles metric for the function. AWS Lambda handles throttled invocation requests differently, depending on their source:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Event sources that aren't stream-based: Some of these event sources invoke a Lambda function synchronously, and others invoke it asynchronously. Handling is different for each:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Synchronous invocation: If the function is invoked synchronously and is throttled, Lambda returns a 429 error and the invoking service is responsible for retries. The ThrottledReason error code explains whether you ran into a function level throttle (if specified) or an account level throttle (see note below). Each service may have its own retry policy. For a list of event sources and their invocation type, see Using AWS Lambda with Other Services.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Asynchronous invocation: If your Lambda function is invoked asynchronously and is throttled, AWS Lambda automatically retries the throttled event for up to six hours, with delays between retries.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Poll-based event sources that are also stream-based: such as Amazon Kinesis or Amazon DynamoDB, AWS Lambda polls your stream and invokes your Lambda function. When your Lambda function is throttled, Lambda attempts to process the throttled batch of records until the time the data expires. This time period can be up to seven days for Amazon Kinesis. The throttled request is treated as blocking per shard, and Lambda doesn't read any new records from the shard until the throttled batch of records either expires or succeeds. If there is more than one shard in the stream, Lambda continues invoking on the non-throttled shards until one gets through.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Poll-based event sources that are not stream-based: such as Amazon Simple Queue Service, AWS Lambda polls your queue and invokes your Lambda function. When your Lambda function is throttled, Lambda attempts to process the throttled batch of records until it is successfully invoked (in which case the message is automatically deleted from the queue) or until the MessageRetentionPeriod set for the queue expires.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Monitoring Your Concurrency Usage     
Amazon Lambda,"To understand your concurrent execution usage, AWS Lambda provides the following metrics:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"ConcurrentExecutions: This shows you the concurrent executions at an account level, and for any function with a custom concurrency limit.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,UnreservedConcurrentExecutions: This shows you the total concurrent executions for functions assigned to the default unreserved concurrency pool.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"To learn about these metrics and how to access them, see Monitoring and Troubleshooting Lambda Applications.     "
Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda Environment Variables     
Amazon Lambda,"Environment variables for Lambda functions enable you to dynamically pass settings to your function code and libraries, without making changes to your code. Environment variables are key-value pairs that you create and modify as part of your function configuration, using either the AWS Lambda Console, the AWS Lambda CLI or the AWS Lambda SDK. AWS Lambda then makes these key value pairs available to your Lambda function code using standard APIs supported by the language, like process.env for Node.js functions.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You can use environment variables to help libraries know what directory to install files in, where to store outputs, store connection and logging settings, and more. By separating these settings from the application logic, you don't need to update your function code when you need to change the function behavior based on different settings.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Setting Up     
Amazon Lambda,"Suppose you want a Lambda function to behave differently as it moves through lifecycle stages from development to deployment. For example, the dev, test, and production stages can contain databases that the function needs to connect to that require different connection information and use different table names. You can create environment variables to reference the database names, connection information or table names and set the value for the function based on the stage in which it’s executing (for example, development, test, production) while your function code remains unchanged.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The following screenshots show how to modify your function's configuration using the AWS console. The first screenshot configures the settings for the function corresponding to a test stage. The second one configures settings for a production stage.

Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You can also use the AWS CLI to create Lambda functions that contain environment variables. For more details, see the CreateFunction and UpdateFunctionConfiguration APIs. Environment variables are also supported when creating and updating functions using AWS CloudFormation. Environment variables can also be used to configure settings specific to the language runtime or a library included in your function. For example, you can modify PATH to specify a directory where executables are stored. You can also set runtime-specific environment variables, such as PYTHONPATH for Python or NODE_PATH for Node.js.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The following example creates a new Lambda function that sets the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable, which is used to specify a directory where shared libraries are dynamically loaded at runtime. In this example, the Lambda function code uses the shared library in the /usr/bin/test/lib64 directory. Note that the Runtime parameter uses nodejs6.10 but you can also specify nodejs8.10.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,$ aws lambda create-function --function-name myTestFunction \     
Amazon Lambda,    --zip-file fileb://package.zip \     
Amazon Lambda,    --role role-arn \     
Amazon Lambda,"    --environment Variables=""{LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/bin/test/lib64}"" \     "
Amazon Lambda,    --handler index.handler --runtime nodejs6.10     
Amazon Lambda,Rules for Naming Environment Variables     
Amazon Lambda,There is no limit to the number of environment variables you can create as long as the total size of the set does not exceed 4 KB.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Other requirements include:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Must start with letters [a-zA-Z].     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores ([a-zA-Z0-9_].     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"In addition, there are a specific set of keys that AWS Lambda reserves. If you try to set values for any of these reserved keys, you will receive an error message indicating that the action is not allowed. For more information on these keys, see Environment Variables Available to Lambda Functions.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Environment Variables and Function Versioning     
Amazon Lambda,"Function versioning provides a way to manage your Lambda function code by enabling you to publish one or more versions of your Lambda function as it proceeds from development to test to production. For each version of a Lambda function that you publish, the environment variables (as well as other function-specific configurations such as MemorySize and Timeout limit) are saved as a snapshot of that version and those settings are immutable (cannot be changed).     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"As application and configuration requirements evolve, you can create new versions of your Lambda function and update the environment variables to meet those requirements prior to the newest version being published. The current version of your function is $LATEST.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"In addition, you can create aliases, which are pointers to a particular version of your function. The advantage of aliases is that if you need to roll back to a previous function version, you point the alias to that version, which contains the environment variables required for that version. For more information, see AWS Lambda Function Versioning and Aliases.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Environment Variable Encryption     
Amazon Lambda,"When you create or update Lambda functions that use environment variables, AWS Lambda encrypts them using the AWS Key Management Service. When your Lambda function is invoked, those values are decrypted and made available to the Lambda code.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The first time you create or update Lambda functions that use environment variables in a region, a default service key is created for you automatically within AWS KMS. This key is used to encrypt environment variables. However, should you wish to use encryption helpers and use KMS to encrypt environment variables after your Lambda function is created, then you must create your own AWS KMS key and choose it instead of the default key. The default key will give errors when chosen. Creating your own key gives you more flexibility, including the ability to create, rotate, disable, and define access controls, and to audit the encryption keys used to protect your data. For more information, see the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If you use your own key, you will be billed per AWS Key Management Service Pricing guidelines. You will not be billed if you use the default service key provided by AWS Lambda.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If you’re using the default KMS service key for Lambda, then no additional IAM permissions are required in your function execution role – your role will just work automatically without changes. If you’re supplying your own (custom) KMS key, then you’ll need to add kms:Decrypt to your execution role. In addition, the user that will be creating and updating the Lambda function must have permissions to use the KMS key. For more information on KMS keys, see the Using Key Policies in AWS KMS.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"AWS Lambda authorizes your function to use the default KMS key through a user grant, which it adds when you assign the role to the function. If you delete the role and create a new role with the same name, you need to refresh the role's grant. Refresh the grant by re-assigning the role to the function.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Storing Sensitive Information     
Amazon Lambda,"As mentioned in the previous section, when you deploy your Lambda function, all the environment variables you've specified are encrypted by default after, but not during, the deployment process. They are then decrypted automatically by AWS Lambda when the function is invoked. If you need to store sensitive information in an environment variable, we strongly suggest you encrypt that information before deploying your Lambda function.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Fortunately, the Lambda console makes that easier for you by providing encryption helpers that leverage AWS Key Management Service to store that sensitive information as Ciphertext. The Lambda console also provides decryption helper code to decrypt that information for use in your in Lambda function code. For more information, see Create a Lambda Function Using Environment Variables To Store Sensitive Information.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Error scenarios     
Amazon Lambda,"If your function configuration exceeds 4KB, or you use environment variable keys reserved by AWS Lambda, then your update or create operation will fail with a configuration error. During execution time, it's possible that the encryption/decryption of environment variables can fail. If AWS Lambda is unable to decrypt the environment variables due to an AWS KMS service exception, AWS KMS will return an exception message explaining what the error conditions are and what, if any, remedies you can apply to address the issue. These will be logged to your function log stream in Amazon CloudWatch logs. For example, if the KMS key you are using to access the environment variables is disabled, you will see the following error:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Lambda was unable to configure access to your environment variables because the KMS key used is disabled.      
Amazon Lambda,            Please check your KMS key settings.     
Amazon Lambda,Create a Lambda Function Using Environment Variables     
Amazon Lambda,This section will illustrate how you can modify a Lambda function's behavior through configuration changes that require no changes to the Lambda function code.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"In this tutorial, you will do the following:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Create a deployment package with sample code that returns the value of an environment variable that specifies the name of an Amazon S3 bucket.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Invoke a Lambda function and verify that the Amazon S3 bucket name that is returned matches the value set by the environment variable.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Update the Lambda function by changing the Amazon S3 bucket name specified by the environment variable.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Invoke the Lambda function again and verify that the Amazon S3 bucket name that is returned matches the updated value.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Set Up the Lambda Environment     
Amazon Lambda,The code sample below reads the environment variable of a Lambda function that returns the name of an Amazon S3 bucket.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Open a text editor and copy the following code:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"exports.handler = function(event, context, callback) {     "
Amazon Lambda,  var bucketName = process.env.S3_BUCKET;     
Amazon Lambda,"  callback(null, bucketName);     "
Amazon Lambda,};     
Amazon Lambda,Save the file as index.js.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Zip the index.js. file as Test_Environment_Variables.zip.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Create an Execution Role     
Amazon Lambda,Create an IAM role (execution role) that you can specify at the time you create your Lambda function.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Follow the steps in IAM Roles in the IAM User Guide to create an IAM role (execution role). As you follow the steps to create a role, note the following:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"In Select Role Type, choose AWS Service Roles, and then choose AWS Lambda.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"In Attach Policy, choose the policy named AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Write down the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role. You need this value when you create your Lambda function in the next step.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Create the Lambda function and Test It     
Amazon Lambda,"In this section, you create a Lambda function containing an environment variable that specifies an Amazon S3 bucket named Test. When invoked, the function simply returns the name of the Amazon S3 bucket. Then you update the configuration by changing the Amazon S3 bucket name to Prod and when invoked again, the function returns the updated name of the Amazon S3 bucket.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"To create the Lambda function, open a command prompt and run the following Lambda AWS CLI create-function command. You need to provide the .zip file path and the execution role ARN.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,$ aws lambda  create-function --function-name ReturnBucketName \     
Amazon Lambda,--zip-file fileb://file-path/Test_Environment_Variables.zip \

Amazon Lambda,"Next, run the following Lambda CLI invoke command to invoke the function.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,$ aws lambda invoke --function-name ReturnBucketName outputfile.txt     
Amazon Lambda,"The Lambda function will return the name of the Amazon S3 bucket as ""Test"".     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Next, run the following Lambda CLI update-function-configuration command to update the Amazon S3 environment variable by pointing it to the Prod bucket.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,$ aws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name ReturnBucketName \     
Amazon Lambda,--environment Variables={S3_BUCKET=Prod}     
Amazon Lambda,"Run the aws lambda invoke command again using the same parameters. This time, the Lambda function will return the Amazon S3 bucket name as Prod.     "
Amazon Lambda,Create a Lambda Function Using Environment Variables To Store Sensitive Information     
Amazon Lambda,"Along with specifying configuration settings for your Lambda function, you can also use environment variables to store sensitive information, such as a database password, using AWS Key Management Service and the Lambda console's encryption helpers. For more information, see Environment Variable Encryption. The following example shows you how to do this and also how to use KMS to decrypt that information.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"This tutorial will demonstrate how you can use the Lambda console to encrypt an environment variable containing sensitive information. Note that if you are updating an existing function, you can skip ahead to the instruction step outlining how to Expand the Environment Variables section of Step 2: Configure the Lambda Function.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Step 1: Create the Lambda Function     
Amazon Lambda,Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Lambda console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Choose Create a Lambda function.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"In Select blueprint, choose the Author from scratch button.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"In Basic information, do the following:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"In Name, specify your Lambda function name.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"In Role, choose Choose an existing role.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"In Existing role, choose lambda_basic_execution.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If the policy of the execution role does not have the decrypt permission, you will need add it.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Choose Create function.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Step 2: Configure the Lambda Function     
Amazon Lambda,"Under Configuration, specify the Runtime of your choice.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Under the Lambda function code section you can take advantage of the Edit code inline option to replace the Lambda function handler code with your custom code.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Note the Triggers tab. Under the Triggers page, you can optionally choose a service that automatically triggers your Lambda function by choosing the Add trigger button and then choosing the gray box with ellipses (...) to display a list of available services. For this example, do not configure a trigger and choose Configuration.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Note the Monitoring tab. This page will provide immediate CloudWatch metrics for your Lambda function invocations, as well as links to other helpful guides, including Using AWS X-Ray.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Expand the Environment variables section.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Enter your key-value pair. Expand the Encryption configuration section. Note that Lambda provides a default service key under KMS key to encrypt at rest which encrypts your information after it has been uploaded. If the information you provided is sensitive, you can additionally check the Enable helpers for encryption in transit checkbox and supply a custom key. This masks the value you entered and results in a call to AWS KMS to encrypt the value and return it as Ciphertext. If you haven't created a KMS key for your account, you will be provided a link to the AWS IAM console to create one. The account must have encrypt and decrypt permissions for that key. Note that the Encrypt button toggles to Decrypt after you choose it. This affords you the option to update the information. Once you have done that, choose the Encrypt button.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The Code button provides sample decrypt code specific to the runtime of your Lambda function that you can use with your application.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You cannot use the default Lambda service key for encrypting sensitive information on the client side. For more information, see Environment Variable Encryption.     "
Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda Function Versioning and Aliases     
Amazon Lambda,"By using versioning, you can manage your in-production function code in AWS Lambda better. When you use versioning in AWS Lambda, you can publish one or more versions of your Lambda function. As a result, you can work with different variations of your Lambda function in your development workflow, such as development, beta, and production.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Each Lambda function version has a unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN). After you publish a version, it can't be changed.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"AWS Lambda also supports creating aliases for each of your Lambda function versions. Conceptually, an AWS Lambda alias is a pointer to a specific Lambda function version. It's also a resource similar to a Lambda function, and each alias has a unique ARN. Each alias maintains an ARN for the function version to which it points. An alias can only point to a function version, not to another alias. Unlike versions, aliases can be modified. You can update aliases to point to different versions of functions.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Aliases enable you to abstract the process of promoting new Lambda function versions into production from the mapping of the Lambda function version and its event source.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For example, suppose Amazon S3 is the event source that invokes your Lambda function when new objects are created in a bucket. When Amazon S3 is your event source, you store the event source mapping information in the bucket notification configuration. In that configuration, you can identify the Lambda function ARN that Amazon S3 can invoke. However, in this case each time you publish a new version of your Lambda function you need to update the notification configuration so that Amazon S3 invokes the correct version.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"In contrast, instead of specifying the function ARN, suppose that you specify an alias ARN in the notification configuration (for example, PROD alias ARN). As you promote new versions of your Lambda function into production, you only need to update the PROD alias to point to the latest stable version. You don't need to update the notification configuration in Amazon S3.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The same applies when you need to roll back to a previous version of your Lambda function. In this scenario, you just update the PROD alias to point to a different function version. There is no need to update event source mappings.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,We recommend that you use versioning and aliases to deploy your Lambda functions when building applications with multiple dependencies and developers involved.

Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Creating a Lambda Function (the $LATEST Version)     
Amazon Lambda,"When you create a Lambda function, there is only one version—the $LATEST version.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,You can refer to this function using its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). There are two ARNs associated with this initial version:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Qualified ARN – The function ARN with the version suffix.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,arn:aws:lambda:aws-region:acct-id:function:helloworld:$LATEST     
Amazon Lambda,Unqualified ARN – The function ARN without the version suffix.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You can use this unqualified ARN in all relevant operations. However, you cannot use it to create an alias. For more information, see Introduction to AWS Lambda Aliases.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The unqualified ARN has its own resource policies.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,arn:aws:lambda:aws-region:acct-id:function:helloworld     
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Unless you choose to publish versions, the $LATEST function version is the only Lambda function version that you have. You can use either the qualified or unqualified ARN in your event source mapping to invoke the $LATEST version.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The following is an example response for a CreateFunction API call.

Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"In this response, AWS Lambda returns the unqualified ARN of the newly created function and also its version, $LATEST. The response also shows that the Version is $LATEST. The CodeSha256 is the checksum of the deployment package that you uploaded.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Publishing an AWS Lambda Function Version     
Amazon Lambda,"When you publish a version, AWS Lambda makes a snapshot copy of the Lambda function code (and configuration) in the $LATEST version. A published version is immutable. That is, you can't change the code or configuration information. The new version has a unique ARN that includes a version number suffix as shown following.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,You can publish a version by using any of the following methods:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Publish a version explicitly – You can use the PublishVersion API operation to explicitly publish a version. For more information, see PublishVersion. This operation creates a new version using the code and configuration in the $LATEST version.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Publish a version at the time you create or update a Lambda function – You can also use the CreateFunction or UpdateFunctionCode requests to publish a version by adding the optional publish parameter in the request:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Specify the publish parameter in your CreateFunction request to create a new Lambda function (the $LATEST version). You can then immediately publish the new function by creating a snapshot and assigning it to be version 1. For more information about CreateFunction, see CreateFunction.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Specify the publish parameter in your UpdateFunctionCode request to update the code in the $LATEST version. You can then publish a version from the $LATEST. For more information about UpdateFunctionCode, see UpdateFunctionCode.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If you specify the publish parameter at the time you create a Lambda function, the function configuration information that AWS Lambda returns in response shows the version number of the newly published version. In the following example, the version is 1.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,{     
Amazon Lambda,"    ""CodeSize"": 287,     "

Amazon Lambda,"    ""Version"": ""1""      "
Amazon Lambda,}     
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Lambda only publishes a new version if the code hasn't yet been published or if the code has changed when compared against the $LATEST version. If there is no change, the $LATEST published version is returned.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,We recommend that you publish a version at the same time that you create your Lambda function or update your Lambda function code. This recommendation especially applies when multiple developers contribute to the same Lambda function development. You can use the publish parameter in your request to do this.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"When you have multiple developers working on a project, you can have a scenario where developer A creates a Lambda function ($LATEST version). Before developer A publishes this version, developer B might update the code (the deployment package) associated with the $LATEST version. In this case, you lose the original code that developer A uploaded. When both developers add the publish parameter, it prevents the race condition described.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Each version of a Lambda function is a unique resource with a Amazon Resource Name (ARN). The following example shows the ARN of version number 1 of the helloworld Lambda function.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,arn:aws:lambda:aws-region:acct-id:function:helloworld:1     
Amazon Lambda,"You can publish multiple versions of a Lambda function. Each time you publish a version, AWS Lambda copies $LATEST version (code and configuration information) to create a new version. When you publish additional versions, AWS Lambda assigns a monotonically increasing sequence number for versioning, even if the function was deleted and recreated. Version numbers are never reused, even for a function that has been deleted and recreated. This approach means that the consumer of a function version can depend on the executable of that version to never change (except if it's deleted).     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If you want to reuse a qualifier, use aliases with your versions. Aliases can be deleted and re-created with the same name.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Updating Lambda Function Code and Configuration     
Amazon Lambda,"AWS Lambda maintains your latest function code in the $LATEST version. When you update your function code, AWS Lambda replaces the code in the $LATEST version of the Lambda function. For more information, see UpdateFunctionCode.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,You have the following options of publishing a new version as you update your Lambda function code:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Publish a version in the same update code request – Use the UpdateFunctionCode API operation (recommended).     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"First update the code, and then explicitly publish a version – Use the PublishVersion API operation.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You can update code and configuration information (such as description, memory size, and execution timeout) for the $LATEST version of the Lambda function.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Deleting a Lambda Function and a Specific Version     
Amazon Lambda,"With versioning, you have the following choices:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Delete a specific version – You can delete a Lambda function version by specifying the version you want to delete in your DeleteFunction request. If there are aliases that depend on this version, the request fails. AWS Lambda deletes the version only if there are no aliases dependent on this version. For more information about aliases, see Introduction to AWS Lambda Aliases.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Delete the entire Lambda function (all of its versions and aliases) – To delete the Lambda function and all of its versions, don't specify any version in your DeleteFunction request. Doing this deletes the entire function including all of its versions and aliases.     "
Amazon Lambda,Introduction to AWS Lambda Aliases     
Amazon Lambda,"You can create one or more aliases for your Lambda function. An AWS Lambda alias is like a pointer to a specific Lambda function version. For more information about versioning, see Introduction to AWS Lambda Versioning.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"By using aliases, you can access the Lambda function an alias is pointing to (for example, to invoke the function) without the caller having to know the specific version the alias is pointing to.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda aliases enable the following use cases:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Easier support for promotion of new versions of Lambda functions and rollback when needed – After initially creating a Lambda function (the $LATEST version), you can publish a version 1 of it. By creating an alias named PROD that points to version 1, you can now use the PROD alias to invoke version 1 of the Lambda function.     "

Amazon Lambda,"Now, you can update the code (the $LATEST version) with all of your improvements, and then publish another stable and improved version (version 2). You can promote version 2 to production by remapping the PROD alias so that it points to version 2. If you find something wrong, you can easily roll back the production version to version 1 by remapping the PROD alias so that it points to version 1.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Simplify management of event source mappings – Instead of using Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) for Lambda function in event source mappings, you can use an alias ARN. This approach means that you don't need to update your event source mappings when you promote a new version or roll back to a previous version.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Both the Lambda function and alias are AWS Lambda resources, and like all other AWS resources they both have unique ARNs. The following example shows a Lambda function (the $LATEST version), with one published version. Each version has an alias pointing to it.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,You can access the function using either the function ARN or the alias ARN.

Amazon Lambda,Example: Using Aliases to Manage Lambda Function Versions     
Amazon Lambda,The following is an example scenario of how to use versioning and aliases to promote new versions of Lambda functions into production.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Initially, you create a Lambda function.     "
Amazon Lambda,"The function you create is the $LATEST version. You also create an alias (DEV, for development) that points to the newly created function. Developers can use this alias to test the function with the event sources in a development environment.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You then test the function version using event sources in a beta environment in a stable way, while continuing to develop newer versions.     "
Amazon Lambda,"You publish a version from the $LATEST and have another alias (BETA) point to it. This approach allows you to associate your beta event sources to this specific alias. In the event source mappings, use the BETA alias to associate your Lambda function with the event source.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,You then promote the Lambda function version in production to work with event sources in production environment.     
Amazon Lambda,"After testing the BETA version of the function, you can define the production version by creating an alias that maps to version 1. In this approach, you point your production event sources to this specific version. You do this by creating a PROD alias and using the PROD alias ARN in all of your production event source mappings.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You continue development, publish more versions, and test.     "
Amazon Lambda,"As you develop your code, you can update the $LATEST version by uploading updated code and then publish to beta testing by having the BETA alias point to it. This simple remapping of the beta alias lets you put version 2 of your Lambda function into beta without changing any of your event sources. This approach is how aliases enable you to control which versions of your function are used with specific event sources in your development environment.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If you want to try creating this setup using the AWS Command Line Interface, see Tutorial: Using AWS Lambda Aliases.     "
Amazon Lambda,Tutorial: Using AWS Lambda Aliases     
Amazon Lambda,This AWS CLI-based tutorial creates Lambda function versions and aliases that point to it as described in the Example: Using Aliases to Manage Lambda Function Versions.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,This example uses the us-west-2 (US West Oregon) region to create the Lambda function and aliases.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Create a deployment package that you can upload to create your Lambda function:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Open a text editor, and then copy the following code.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,console.log('Loading function');     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"exports.handler = function(event, context, callback) {     "
Amazon Lambda,"    console.log('value1 =', event.key1);     "
Amazon Lambda,"    console.log('value2 =', event.key2);     "
Amazon Lambda,"    console.log('value3 =', event.key3);     "
Amazon Lambda,"    callback(null, ""message"");       "
Amazon Lambda,        
Amazon Lambda,};     
Amazon Lambda,Save the file as helloworld.js.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Zip the helloworld.js file as helloworld.zip.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Create an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role (execution role) that you can specify at the time you create your Lambda function:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Follow the steps in IAM Roles in the IAM User Guide to create an IAM role (execution role). As you follow the steps to create a role, note the following:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For Select Role Type, choose AWS Service Roles, and then choose AWS Lambda.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For Attach Policy, choose the policy named AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Write down the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role. You need this value when you create your Lambda function in the next step.

Amazon Lambda,"--description ""sample alias"" --function-version 1 --name BETA     "
Amazon Lambda,"Now you have two aliases for the helloworld function. The DEV alias points to the $LATEST function version, and the BETA alias points to version 1 of the Lambda function.     "
Amazon Lambda,

Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For information about using the AWS Lambda console to manage versioning, see Managing Versioning Using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or Lambda API Operations.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Granting Permissions in a Push Model     
Amazon Lambda,"In a push model (see AWS Lambda Event Source Mapping), event sources such as Amazon S3 invoke your Lambda function. These event sources maintain a mapping that identifies the function version or alias that they invoke when events occur. Note the following:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"We recommend that you specify an existing Lambda function alias in the mapping configuration (see Introduction to AWS Lambda Aliases). For example, if the event source is Amazon S3, you specify the alias ARN in the bucket notification configuration so that Amazon S3 can invoke the alias when it detects specific events.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"In the push model, you grant event sources permissions using a resource policy that you attach to your Lambda function. In versioning, the permissions you add are specific to the qualifier that you specify in the AddPermission request (see Versioning, Aliases, and Resource Policies).     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For example, the following AWS CLI command grants Amazon S3 permissions to invoke the PROD alias of the helloworld Lambda function (note that the --qualifier parameter specifies the alias name).     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,aws lambda add-permission --function-name helloworld \     
Amazon Lambda,--qualifier PROD --statement-id 1 --principal s3.amazonaws.com --action lambda:InvokeFunction \     
Amazon Lambda,--source-arn arn:aws:s3:::examplebucket --source-account 111111111111      
Amazon Lambda,"In this case, Amazon S3 is now able to invoke the PROD alias and AWS Lambda can then execute the helloworld Lambda function version that the PROD alias points to. For this to work, you must use the PROD alias ARN in the S3 bucket's notification configuration.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For information about how to handle Amazon S3 events, see Tutorial: Using AWS Lambda with Amazon S3.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If you use the AWS Lambda console to add an event source for your Lambda function, the console adds the necessary permissions for you.     "
Amazon Lambda,"Versioning, Aliases, and Resource Policies     "
Amazon Lambda,"With versioning and aliases you can access a Lambda function using various ARNs. For example, consider the following scenario.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,You can invoke for example the helloworld function version 1 using any of the following two ARNs:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Using the qualified function ARN as shown following.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,arn:aws:lambda:aws-region:acct-id:function:helloworld:1     
Amazon Lambda,Using the BETA alias ARN as shown following.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,arn:aws:lambda:aws-region:acct-id:function:helloworld:BETA     
Amazon Lambda,"In a push model, event sources (such as Amazon S3 and custom applications) can invoke any of the Lambda function versions as long you grant the necessary permissions to these event sources by using an access policy associated with the Lambda function. For more information about the push model, see AWS Lambda Event Source Mapping.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Assuming that you grant permission, the next question is, ""can an event source invoke a function version using any of the associated ARNs?"" The answer is, it depends on how you identified function in your add permissions request (see AddPermission). The key to understanding this is that the permission you grant apply only to the ARN used in the add permission request:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If you use a qualified function name (such as helloworld:1), the permission is valid for invoking the helloworld function version 1 only using its qualified ARN (using any other ARNs results in a permission error).     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If you use an alias name (such as helloworld:BETA), the permission is valid only for invoking the helloworld function using the BETA alias ARN (using any other ARNs results in a permission error, including the function version ARN to which the alias points).     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If you use an unqualified function name (such as helloworld), the permission is valid only for invoking the helloworld function using the unqualified function ARN (using any other ARNs will result in a permission error).     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Note that even though the access policy is only on the unqualified ARN, the code and configuration of the invoked Lambda function is still from function version $LATEST. The unqualified function ARN maps to the $LATEST version but the permissions you add are ARN-specific.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If you use a qualified function name using the $LATEST version (helloworld:$LATEST), the permission is valid for invoking the helloworld function version $LATEST only using its qualified ARN (using unqualified ARN results in a permission error).     "
Amazon Lambda,"Managing Versioning Using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or Lambda API Operations     "
Amazon Lambda,"You can manage Lambda function versioning programmatically using AWS SDKs (or make the AWS Lambda API calls directly, if you need to), using AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or the AWS Lambda console.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda provides the following APIs to manage versioning and aliases:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,PublishVersion

Amazon Lambda,"For an example of how you can use the AWS CLI, see Tutorial: Using AWS Lambda Aliases.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"This section explains how you can use the AWS Lambda console to manage versioning. In the AWS Lambda console, choose a function and then choose Qualifiers.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The expanded Qualifiers menu displays a Versions and Aliases tab, as shown in the following screen shot. In the Versions pane, you can see a list of versions for the selected function. If you have not previously published a version for the selected function, the Versions pane lists only the $LATEST version, as shown following.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Choose the Aliases tab to see a list of aliases for the function. Initially, you won't have any aliases, as shown following.     "
Amazon Lambda,

Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"To learn about versioning and aliases, see AWS Lambda Function Versioning and Aliases.     "
Amazon Lambda,Traffic Shifting Using Aliases     
Amazon Lambda,"By default, an alias points to a single Lambda function version. When the alias is updated to point to a different function version, incoming request traffic in turn instantly points to the updated version. This exposes that alias to any potential instabilities introduced by the new version. To minimize this impact, you can implement the routing-config parameter of the Lambda alias that allows you to point to two different versions of the Lambda function and dictate what percentage of incoming traffic is sent to each version.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For example, you can specify that only 2 percent of incoming traffic is routed to the new version while you analyze its readiness for a production environment, while the remaining 98 percent is routed to the original version. As the new version matures, you can gradually update the ratio as necessary until you have determined the new version is stable. You can then update the alias to route all traffic to the new version.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,You can point an alias to a maximum of two Lambda function versions. In addition:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Both versions must have the same IAM execution role.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Both versions must have the same AWS Lambda Function Dead Letter Queues configuration, or no DLQ configuration.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"When pointing an alias to more than one version, the alias cannot point to $LATEST.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Traffic Shifting Using an Alias (CLI)     
Amazon Lambda,"To configure an alias to shift traffic between two function versions based on weights by using the CreateAlias operation, you need to configure the routing-config parameter. The example following points an alias to two different Lambda function versions, with version 2 receiving 2 percent of the invocation traffic and the remaining 98 percent invoking version 1.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,aws lambda create-alias --name alias name --function-name function-name \ --function-version 1     
Amazon Lambda,"--routing-config AdditionalVersionWeights={""2""=0.02}     "
Amazon Lambda,"You can update the percentage of incoming traffic to your new version (version 2) by using the UpdateAlias operation. For example, you can boost the invocation traffic to your new version to 5 percent, as shown following.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,aws lambda update-alias --name alias name --function-name function-name \     
Amazon Lambda,"--routing-config AdditionalVersionWeights={""2""=0.05}     "
Amazon Lambda,"To route all traffic to version 2, again use the UpdateAlias operation to change the function-version property to point to version 2. In the same command, reset the routing configuration.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,aws lambda update-alias --name alias name --function-name function-name \      
Amazon Lambda,--function-version 2 --routing-config AdditionalVersionWeights={}     
Amazon Lambda,Traffic Shifting Using an Alias (Console)     
Amazon Lambda,You can configure traffic shifting with an alias by using the Lambda console as described below:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Open your Lambda function and verify that you have at least two previously published versions. Otherwise, you can go to Introduction to AWS Lambda Versioning to learn more about versioning, and publish your first function version.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For Actions, choose Create alias.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"In the Create a new alias window, specify a value for Name*, optionally for Description, and for Version* of the Lambda function that the alias will point to. Here the version is 1.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Under Additional version, specify the following:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Specify a second Lambda function version.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Type a weight value for the function. Weight is the percentage of traffic that is assigned to that version when the alias is invoked. The first version receives the residual weight. For example, if you specify 10 percent to Additional version, the first version automatically is assigned 90 percent.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Choose Create.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Determining Which Version Has Been Invoked     
Amazon Lambda,"When your alias is shifting traffic between two function versions, there are two ways to determine which Lambda function version has been invoked:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,CloudWatch Logs – Lambda automatically emits a START log entry that contains the invoked version ID to CloudWatch Logs for every function invocation. An example follows.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,19:44:37 START RequestId: request id Version: $version     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Lambda uses the Executed Version dimension to filter the metric data by the executed version. This only applies to alias invocations. For more information, see AWS Lambda CloudWatch Dimensions.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Response payload (synchronous invocations) – Responses to synchronous function invocations include an x-amz-executed-version header to indicate which function version has been invoked.     
Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda Layers     
Amazon Lambda,"You can configure your Lambda function to pull in additional code and content in the form of layers. A layer is a ZIP archive that contains libraries, a custom runtime, or other dependencies. With layers, you can use libraries in your function without needing to include them in your deployment package.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Layers let you keep your deployment package small, which makes development easier. You can avoid errors that can occur when you install and package dependencies with your function code. For Node.js, Python, and Ruby functions, you can develop your function code in the Lambda console as long as you keep your deployment package under 3 MB.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"A function can use up to 5 layers at a time. The total unzipped size of the function and all layers can't exceed the unzipped deployment package size limit of 250 MB. For more information, see AWS Lambda Limits.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You can create layers, or use layers published by AWS and other AWS customers. Layers support resource-based policies for granting layer usage permissions to specific AWS accounts, AWS Organizations, or all accounts.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Layers are extracted to the /opt directory in the function execution environment. Each runtime looks for libraries in a different location under /opt, depending on the language. Structure your layer so that function code can access libraries without additional configuration.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You can also use AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) to manage layers and your function's layer configuration. For instructions, see Declaring Serverless Resources in the AWS Serverless Application Model Developer Guide.     "

Amazon Lambda,Configuring a Lambda Function to Access Resources in an Amazon VPC     
Amazon Lambda,"You can configure a function to connect to private subnets in a virtual private cloud (VPC) in your account. Use Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) to create a private network for resources such as databases, cache instances, or internal services. Connect your function to the VPC to access private resources during execution.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"AWS Lambda runs your function code securely within a VPC by default. However, to enable your Lambda function to access resources inside your private VPC, you must provide additional VPC-specific configuration information that includes private subnet IDs and security group IDs. AWS Lambda uses this information to set up elastic network interfaces (ENIs) that enable your function to connect securely to other resources within your private VPC.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Lambda functions cannot connect directly to a VPC with dedicated instance tenancy. To connect to resources in a dedicated VPC, peer it to a second VPC with default tenancy.     "

Amazon Lambda,"You add VPC information to your Lambda function configuration using the VpcConfig parameter, either at the time you create a Lambda function (see CreateFunction), or you can add it to the existing Lambda function configuration (see UpdateFunctionConfiguration). Following are AWS CLI examples:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The create-function CLI command specifies the --vpc-config parameter to provide VPC information at the time you create a Lambda function.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,$ aws lambda create-function --function-name my-function \     
Amazon Lambda,--runtime go1.x --handler main --zip-file fileb://main.zip \     
Amazon Lambda,#NAME?
Amazon Lambda,#NAME?
Amazon Lambda,The update-function-configuration CLI command specifies the --vpc-config parameter to add VPC information to an existing Lambda function configuration.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,$ aws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name my-function \     
Amazon Lambda,#NAME?
Amazon Lambda,"To remove VPC-related information from your Lambda function configuration, use the UpdateFunctionConfiguration API by providing an empty list of subnet IDs and security group IDs as shown in the following example CLI command.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,$ aws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name my-function \     
Amazon Lambda,"--vpc-config SubnetIds=[],SecurityGroupIds=[]     "
Amazon Lambda,"When you add VPC configuration to a Lambda function, it can only access resources in that VPC. If a Lambda function needs to access both VPC resources and the public internet, the VPC needs to have a Network Address Translation (NAT) instance inside the VPC.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"When a Lambda function is configured to run within a VPC, it incurs an additional ENI start-up penalty. This means address resolution may be delayed when trying to connect to network resources.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Internet Access for Lambda Functions     
Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda uses the VPC information you provide to set up ENIs that allow your Lambda function to access VPC resources. Each ENI is assigned a private IP address from the IP address range within the subnets you specify. Functions that are connected to a VPC do not have public IP addresses or internet access by default.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Several services offer VPC Endpoints. You can use VPC endpoints to connect to AWS services from within a VPC without internet access.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Internet access from a private subnet requires network address translation (NAT). You can give your function access to the internet by adding a NAT gateway or NAT instance to your VPC. An internet gateway does not work as it requires public IP addresses. For more information, see NAT Gateways in the Amazon VPC User Guide.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Guidelines for Setting Up VPC-Enabled Lambda Functions     
Amazon Lambda,Your Lambda function automatically scales based on the number of events it processes. The following are general guidelines for setting up VPC-enabled Lambda functions to support the scaling behavior.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If your Lambda function accesses a VPC, you must make sure that your VPC has sufficient ENI capacity to support the scale requirements of your Lambda function. You can use the following formula to approximately determine the ENI requirements.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Projected peak concurrent executions * (Memory in GB / 3GB)     
Amazon Lambda,Where:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Projected peak concurrent execution – Use the information in Managing Concurrency to determine this value.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Memory – The amount of memory you configured for your Lambda function.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The subnets you specify should have sufficient available IP addresses to match the number of ENIs.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"We also recommend that you specify at least one subnet in each Availability Zone in your Lambda function configuration. By specifying subnets in each of the Availability Zones, your Lambda function can run in another Availability Zone if one goes down or runs out of IP addresses.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If your VPC does not have sufficient ENIs or subnet IPs, your Lambda function will not scale as requests increase, and you will see an increase in invocation errors with EC2 error types like EC2ThrottledException. Amazon VPC applies a limit to ENI creation. You can request an increase to this limit in the Support Center console.     "

Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Create a Lambda function to access the ElastiCache cluster. When you create the Lambda function, you provide subnet IDs in your Amazon VPC and a VPC security group to allow the Lambda function to access resources in your VPC.

Amazon Lambda,Tagging Lambda Functions     
Amazon Lambda,"Lambda functions can span multiple applications across separate regions. To simplify the process of tracking the frequency and cost of each function invocation, you can use tags. Tags are key-value pairs that you attach to AWS resources to better organize them. They are particularly useful when you have many resources of the same type, which in the case of AWS Lambda, is a function. By using tags, customers with hundreds of Lambda functions can easily access and analyze a specific set by filtering on those that contain the same tag. Two of the key advantages of tagging your Lambda functions are:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Grouping and Filtering: By applying tags, you can use the Lambda console or CLI to isolate a list of Lambda functions contained within a specific application or billing department. For more information, see Filtering on Tagged Lambda Functions.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Cost allocation: Because Lambda's support for tagging is integrated with AWS Billing, you can break down bills into dynamic categories and map functions to specific cost centers. For example, if you tag all Lambda functions with a ""Department"" key, then all AWS Lambda costs can be broken down by department. You can then provide an individual department value, such ""Department 1"" or ""Department 2"" to direct the function invocation cost to the appropriate cost center. Cost allocation is surfaced via detailed billing reports, making it easier for you to categorize and track your AWS costs.     "

Amazon Lambda,Tagging Lambda Functions for Billing     
Amazon Lambda,"You can use tags to organize your AWS bill to reflect your own cost structure. To do this, you can add tag keys whose values will be included in the cost allocation report. For more information about setting up a cost allocation report that includes the tag keys you select to be included as line items in the report, see The Monthly Cost Allocation Report in About AWS Account Billing.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"To see the cost of your combined resources, you can organize your billing information based on functions that have the same tag key values. For example, you can tag several Lambda functions with a specific application name, and then organize your billing information to see the total cost of that application across several services. For more information, see Using Cost Allocation Tags in the AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,In AWS Lambda the only resource that can be tagged is a function. You cannot tag an alias or a specific function version. Any invocation of a function's alias or version will be billed as an invocation of the original function.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Applying Tags to Lambda Functions Using the Console     
Amazon Lambda,You can add tags to your function under the Tags section in the configuration tab.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"To remove tags from an existing function, open the function, choose the Tags section and then choose the Remove button next to key-value pair.     "

Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Filtering Lambda Functions Using the Console     
Amazon Lambda,"The Lambda console contains a search field that allows you to filter the list of functions based on a specified set of function attributes, including Tags. Suppose you have two functions named MyFunction and MyFunction2 that have a Tags key called Department. To view those functions, choose the search field and notice the automatic filtering that includes a list of the Tags keys:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Choose the Department key. Lambda will return any function that contains that key.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Now suppose that the key value of the MyFunction tag is ""Department A"" and the key value of MyFunction2 is ""Department B"". You can narrow your search by choosing the value of the Department key, in this case Department A, as shown below.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,This will return only MyFunction.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You can further narrow your search by including the other accepted Function attributes, including Description, Function name or Runtime.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You are limited to a maximum of 50 tags per Lambda function. If you delete the Lambda function, the associated tags will also be deleted.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Filtering Lambda Functions Using the CLI     
Amazon Lambda,"If you want to view the tags that are applied to a specific Lambda function, you can use either of the following Lambda API commands:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,ListTags: You supply your Lambda function ARN (Amazon Resource Name) to view a list of the tags associated with this function:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,$ aws lambda list-tags --resource function arn     
Amazon Lambda,GetFunction: You supply your Lambda function name to a view a list of the tags associated with this function:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,$ aws lambda get-function --function-name my-function     
Amazon Lambda,"You can also use the AWS Tagging Service’s GetResources API to filter your resources by tags. The GetResources API receives up to 10 filters, with each filter containing a tag key and up to 10 tag values. You provide GetResources with a ‘ResourceType’ to filter by specific resource types. For more information about the AWS Tagging Service, see Working with Resource Groups.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Tag Restrictions     
Amazon Lambda,The following restrictions apply to tags:

Amazon Lambda,Maximum number of tags per resource—50     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Maximum key length—128 Unicode characters in UTF-8

Amazon Lambda,Maximum value length—256 Unicode characters in UTF-8     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Tag keys and values are case sensitive.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Do not use the aws: prefix in your tag names or values because it is reserved for AWS use. You can't edit or delete tag names or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per resource limit.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If your tagging schema will be used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, spaces, and numbers representable in UTF-8, plus the following special characters: + - = . _ : / @.     "
Amazon Lambda,"event sources. An event source is the AWS service or custom application that publishes events, and a Lambda function is the custom code that processes the events. To illustrate, consider the following scenarios:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"File processing – Suppose you have a photo sharing application. People use your application to upload photos, and the application stores these user photos in an Amazon S3 bucket. Then, your application creates a thumbnail version of each user's photos and displays them on the user's profile page. In this scenario, you may choose to create a Lambda function that creates a thumbnail automatically. Amazon S3 is one of the supported AWS event sources that can publish object-created events and invoke your Lambda function. Your Lambda function code can read the photo object from the S3 bucket, create a thumbnail version, and then save it in another S3 bucket.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Data and analytics – Suppose you are building an analytics application and storing raw data in a DynamoDB table. When you write, update, or delete items in a table, DynamoDB streams can publish item update events to a stream associated with the table. In this case, the event data provides the item key, event name (such as insert, update, and delete), and other relevant details. You can write a Lambda function to generate custom metrics by aggregating raw data.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Websites – Suppose you are creating a website and you want to host the backend logic on Lambda. You can invoke your Lambda function over HTTP using Amazon API Gateway as the HTTP endpoint. Now, your web client can invoke the API, and then API Gateway can route the request to Lambda.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Mobile applications – Suppose you have a custom mobile application that produces events. You can create a Lambda function to process events published by your custom application. For example, in this scenario you can configure a Lambda function to process the clicks within your custom mobile application.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"AWS Lambda supports many AWS services as event sources. For more information, see Using AWS Lambda with Other Services. When you configure these event sources to trigger a Lambda function, the Lambda function is invoked automatically when events occur. You define event source mapping, which is how you identify what events to track and which Lambda function to invoke.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The following are introductory examples of event sources and how the end-to-end experience works.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Example 1: Amazon S3 Pushes Events and Invokes a Lambda Function     
Amazon Lambda,"Amazon S3 can publish events of different types, such as PUT, POST, COPY, and DELETE object events on a bucket. Using the bucket notification feature, you can configure an event source mapping that directs Amazon S3 to invoke a Lambda function when a specific type of event occurs, as shown in the following illustration.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The diagram illustrates the following sequence:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The user creates an object in a bucket.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Amazon S3 detects the object created event.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Amazon S3 invokes your Lambda function using the permissions provided by the execution role.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"AWS Lambda executes the Lambda function, specifying the event as a parameter.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You configure Amazon S3 to invoke your function as a bucket notification action. To grant Amazon S3 permission to invoke the function, update the function's resource-based policy.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Example 2: AWS Lambda Pulls Events from a Kinesis Stream and Invokes a Lambda Function     
Amazon Lambda,"For poll-based event sources, AWS Lambda polls the source and then invokes the Lambda function when records are detected on that source.     "

Amazon Lambda,The following diagram shows how a custom application writes records to a Kinesis stream.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The diagram illustrates the following sequence:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The custom application writes records to a Kinesis stream.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"AWS Lambda continuously polls the stream, and invokes the Lambda function when the service detects new records on the stream. AWS Lambda knows which stream to poll and which Lambda function to invoke based on the event source mapping you create in Lambda.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The Lambda function is invoked with the incoming event.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"When working with stream-based event sources, you create event source mappings in AWS Lambda. Lambda reads items from the stream invokes the function synchronously. You don't need to grant Lambda permission to invoke the function, but it does need permission to read from the stream.     "
Amazon Lambda,Invocation Types     
Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda supports synchronous and asynchronous invocation of a Lambda function. You can control the invocation type only when you invoke a Lambda function (referred to as on-demand invocation). The following examples illustrate on-demand invocations:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Your custom application invokes a Lambda function.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You manually invoke a Lambda function (for example, using the AWS CLI) for testing purposes.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"In both cases, you invoke your Lambda function using the Invoke operation, and you can specify the invocation type as synchronous or asynchronous.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"When you use AWS services as a trigger, the invocation type is predetermined for each service. You have no control over the invocation type that these event sources use when they invoke your Lambda function.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For example, Amazon S3 always invokes a Lambda function asynchronously and Amazon Cognito always invokes a Lambda function synchronously. For poll-based AWS services (Amazon Kinesis, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Simple Queue Service), AWS Lambda polls the stream or message queue and invokes your Lambda function synchronously.     "
Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda Event Source Mapping     
Amazon Lambda,"Lambda functions and event sources are the core components of AWS Lambda. An event source is the entity that publishes events, and a Lambda function is the custom code that processes the events. Supported event sources are the AWS services that can be preconfigured to work with AWS Lambda. The configuration is referred to as event source mapping, which maps an event source to a Lambda function. It enables automatic invocation of your Lambda function when events occur.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Each event source mapping identifies the type of events to publish and the Lambda function to invoke when events occur. The specific Lambda function then receives the event information as a parameter and your Lambda function code then processes the event.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You can also create custom applications to include AWS resource events and invoke a Lambda function. For more information, see Using AWS Lambda with the AWS Command Line Interface     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,You may be wondering—where do I keep the event mapping information? Do I keep it within the event source or within AWS Lambda? The following sections explain event source mapping for each of these event source categories. These sections also explain how the Lambda function is invoked and how you manage permissions to allow invocation of your Lambda function.

Amazon Lambda,Event Source Mapping for AWS Services     
Amazon Lambda,"Except for the poll-based AWS services (Amazon Kinesis Data Streams and DynamoDB streams or Amazon SQS queues), other supported AWS services publish events and can also invoke your Lambda function (referred to as the push model). In the push model, note the following:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Event source mappings are maintained within the event source. Relevant API support in the event sources enables you to create and manage event source mappings. For example, Amazon S3 provides the bucket notification configuration API. Using this API, you can configure an event source mapping that identifies the bucket events to publish and the Lambda function to invoke.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Because the event sources invoke your Lambda function, you need to grant the event source the necessary permissions using a resource-based policy. For more information, see Using Resource-based Policies for AWS Lambda.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The following example illustrates how this model works.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Example – Amazon S3 Pushes Events and Invokes a Lambda Function     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Suppose that you want your AWS Lambda function invoked for each object created bucket event. You add the necessary event source mapping in the bucket notification configuration.

Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The diagram illustrates the flow:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The user creates an object in a bucket.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Amazon S3 detects the object created event.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Amazon S3 invokes your Lambda function according to the event source mapping described in the bucket notification configuration.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"AWS Lambda verifies the permissions policy attached to the Lambda function to ensure that Amazon S3 has the necessary permissions. For more information on permissions policies, see AWS Lambda Permissions     "

Amazon Lambda,"Once you have configured the event source mapping, AWS Lambda polls the event source and invokes your Lambda function. The event source mappings are maintained within the AWS Lambda. AWS Lambda provides APIs to create and manage event source mappings. For more information, see CreateEventSourceMapping.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"AWS Lambda needs your permission to poll Kinesis and DynamoDB streams or Amazon SQS queues and read records. You grant these permissions via the execution role, using the permissions policy associated with role that you specify when you create your Lambda function. AWS Lambda does not need any permissions to invoke your Lambda function.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The following diagram shows a custom application that writes records to a Kinesis stream and how AWS Lambda polls the stream. When AWS Lambda detects a new record on the stream, it invokes your Lambda function.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Suppose you have a custom application that writes records to a Kinesis stream. You want to invoke a Lambda function when new records are detected on the stream. You create a Lambda function and the necessary event source mapping in AWS Lambda.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The diagram illustrates the following sequence:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The custom application writes records to an Amazon Kinesis stream.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda continuously polls the stream and invokes the Lambda function once the service detects new records on the stream. AWS Lambda knows which stream to poll and which Lambda function to invoke based on the event source mapping you create in AWS Lambda.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda executes the Lambda function.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The example uses a Kinesis stream but the same applies when working with a DynamoDB stream.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Event Source Mapping for Custom Applications     
Amazon Lambda,"If you have custom applications that publish and process events, you can create a Lambda function to process these events. In this case, there is no preconfiguration required—you don't have to set up an event source mapping. Instead, the event source uses the AWS Lambda Invoke API. If the application and Lambda function are owned by different AWS accounts, the AWS account that owns the Lambda function must allow cross-account permissions in the permissions policy associated with the Lambda function.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The following diagram shows how a custom application in your account can invoke a Lambda function. In this example, the custom application is using the same account credentials as the account that owns the Lambda function, and, therefore, does not require additional permissions to invoke the function.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"In the following example, the user application and Lambda function are owned by different AWS accounts. In this case, the AWS account that owns the Lambda function must have cross-account permissions in the permissions policy associated with the Lambda function. For more information, see AWS Lambda Permissions.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda Retry Behavior     
Amazon Lambda,"Function invocation can result in an error for several reasons. Your code might raise an exception, time out, or run out of memory. The runtime executing your code might encounter an error and stop. You might run out concurrency and be throttled.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"When an error occurs, your code might have run completely, partially, or not at all. In most cases, the client or service that invokes your function retries if it encounters an error, so your code must be able to process the same event repeatedly without unwanted effects. If your function manages resources or writes to a database, you need to handle cases where the same request is made several times.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Lambda handles retries in the following manner, depending on the source of the invocation.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Event sources that aren't stream-based – Some of these event sources are set up to invoke a Lambda function synchronously and others invoke it asynchronously. Accordingly, exceptions are handled as follows:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Synchronous invocation – Lambda includes the FunctionError field in the response body, with details about the error in the X-Amz-Function-Error header. The status code is 200 for function errors. Lambda only returns error status codes if there is an issue with the request, function, or permissions that prevents the handler from processing the event. See Invoke Errors for details.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"AWS service triggers can retry depending on the service. If you invoke the Lambda function directly from your application, you can choose whether to retry or not.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Asynchronous invocation – Asynchronous events are queued before being used to invoke the Lambda function. If AWS Lambda is unable to fully process the event, it will automatically retry the invocation twice, with delays between retries. Configure a dead letter queue for your function to capture requests that fail all three attempts.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Poll-based event sources that are stream-based – These consist of Kinesis Data Streams or DynamoDB. When a Lambda function invocation fails, AWS Lambda attempts to process the erring batch of records until the time the data expires, which can be up to seven days.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The exception is treated as blocking, and AWS Lambda will not read any new records from the shard until the failed batch of records either expires or is processed successfully. This ensures that AWS Lambda processes the stream events in order.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Poll-based event sources that are not stream-based – This consists of Amazon Simple Queue Service. If you configure an Amazon SQS queue as an event source, AWS Lambda will poll a batch of records in the queue and invoke your Lambda function. If the invocation fails or times out, every message in the batch will be returned to the queue, and each will be available for processing once the Visibility Timeout period expires. (Visibility timeouts are a period of time during which Amazon Simple Queue Service prevents other consumers from receiving and processing the message).     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Once an invocation successfully processes a batch, each message in that batch will be removed from the queue. When a message is not successfully processed, it is either discarded or if you have configured an Amazon SQS Dead Letter Queue, the failure information will be directed there for you to analyze.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If you don't require ordered processing of events, the advantage of using Amazon SQS queues is that AWS Lambda will continue to process new messages, regardless of a failed invocation of a previous message. In other words, processing of new messages will not be blocked.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For more information about invocation modes, see AWS Lambda Event Source Mapping.     "
Amazon Lambda,Understanding Scaling Behavior     
Amazon Lambda,"Concurrent executions refers to the number of executions of your function code that are happening at any given time. You can estimate the concurrent execution count, but the concurrent execution count will differ depending on whether or not your Lambda function is processing events from a poll-based event source.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If you create a Lambda function to process events from event sources that aren't poll-based (for example, Lambda can process every event from other sources, like Amazon S3 or API Gateway), each published event is a unit of work, in parallel, up to your account limits. Therefore, the number of invocations these event sources make influences the concurrency. You can use this formula to estimate the capacity used by your function:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,invocations per second * average execution duration in seconds     
Amazon Lambda,"For example, consider a Lambda function that processes Amazon S3 events. Suppose that the Lambda function takes on average three seconds and Amazon S3 publishes 10 events per second. Then, you will have 30 concurrent executions of your Lambda function.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The number of concurrent executions for poll-based event sources also depends on additional factors, as noted following:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Poll-based event sources that are stream-based     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Amazon Kinesis Data Streams     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Amazon DynamoDB     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For Lambda functions that process Kinesis or DynamoDB streams the number of shards is the unit of concurrency. If your stream has 100 active shards, there will be at most 100 Lambda function invocations running concurrently. This is because Lambda processes each shard’s events in sequence.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Poll-based event sources that are not stream-based: For Lambda functions that process Amazon SQS queues, AWS Lambda will automatically scale the polling on the queue until the maximum concurrency level is reached, where each message batch can be considered a single concurrent unit. AWS Lambda's automatic scaling behavior is designed to keep polling costs low when a queue is empty while simultaneously enabling you to achieve high throughput when the queue is being used heavily.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"When an Amazon SQS event source mapping is initially enabled, Lambda begins long-polling the Amazon SQS queue. Long polling helps reduce the cost of polling Amazon Simple Queue Service by reducing the number of empty responses, while providing optimal processing latency when messages arrive.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"When messages are available, Lambda initially launches up to 5 instances of your function, to handle 5 batches simultaneously. Then, Lambda launches up to 60 more instances per minute, up to 1000 total, as long as you have concurrency available at the account and function level.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Account-level limits are impacted by other functions in the account, and per-function concurrency applies to all events sent to a function.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Request Rate     
Amazon Lambda,"Request rate refers to the rate at which your Lambda function is invoked. For all services except the poll-based services, the request rate is the rate at which the event sources generate the events. For poll-based services, AWS Lambda calculates the request rate as follows:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,request rate = number of concurrent executions / function duration     
Amazon Lambda,"For example, if there are five active shards on a stream (that is, you have five Lambda functions running in parallel) and your Lambda function takes about two seconds, the request rate is 2.5 requests/second.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Automatic Scaling     
Amazon Lambda,"AWS Lambda dynamically scales function execution in response to increased traffic, up to your concurrency limit. Under sustained load, your function's concurrency bursts to an initial level between 500 and 3000 concurrent executions that varies per region. After the initial burst, the function's capacity increases by an additional 500 concurrent executions each minute until either the load is accommodated, or the total concurrency of all functions in the region hits the limit.     "

Amazon Lambda,"If your function is connected to a VPC, the Amazon VPC network interface limit can prevent it from scaling. For more information, see Configuring a Lambda Function to Access Resources in an Amazon VPC.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"To limit scaling, you can configure functions with reserved concurrency. For more information, see Managing Concurrency.     "
Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda Function Dead Letter Queues     
Amazon Lambda,"Any Lambda function invoked asynchronously is retried twice before the event is discarded. If the retries fail and you're unsure why, use Dead Letter Queues (DLQ) to direct unprocessed events to an Amazon SQS queue or an Amazon SNS topic to analyze the failure.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"AWS Lambda directs events that cannot be processed to the specified Amazon SNS topic or Amazon SQS queue. Functions that don't specify a DLQ will discard events after they have exhausted their retries. For more information about retry policies, see AWS Lambda Retry Behavior.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,You configure a DLQ by specifying the Amazon Resource Name TargetArn value on the Lambda function's DeadLetterConfig parameter.

Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,For Amazon SQS: SendMessage     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,For Amazon SNS: Publish     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The payload written to the DLQ target ARN is the original event payload with no modifications to the message body. The attributes of the message contain information to help you understand why the event wasn’t processed:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,DLQ Message Attributes     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Name Type Value   
Amazon Lambda,RequestID String Unique request identifier   
Amazon Lambda,ErrorCode Number 3-digit HTTP error code   
Amazon Lambda,ErrorMessage String Error message (truncated to 1 KB)   
Amazon Lambda,"DLQ messages can fail to reach their target due to permissions issues, or if the total size of the message exceeds the limit for the target queue or topic. For example, if an Amazon SNS notification with a body close to 256 KB triggers a function that results in an error, the additional event data added by Amazon SNS, combined with the attributes added by Lambda, can cause the message to exceed the maximum size allowed in the DLQ. When it can't write to the DLQ, Lambda deletes the event and emits the DeadLetterErrors metric.     "

Amazon Lambda,Invoking Lambda Functions with the AWS Mobile SDK for Android     
Amazon Lambda,"You can call a Lambda function from a mobile application. Put business logic in functions to separate its development lifecycle from that of front-end clients, making mobile applications less complex to develop and maintain. With the Mobile SDK for Android, you use Amazon Cognito to authenticate users and authorize requests.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"When you invoke a function from a mobile application, you choose the event structure, invocation type, and permission model. You can use aliases to enable seamless updates to your function code, but otherwise the function and application are tightly coupled. As you add more functions, you can create an API layer to decouple your function code from your front-end clients and improve performance.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"To create a fully-featured web API for your mobile and web applications, use Amazon API Gateway. With API Gateway, you can add custom authorizers, throttle requests, and cache results for all of your functions. For more information, see Using AWS Lambda with Amazon API Gateway.     "

Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda Execution Context     
Amazon Lambda,"When AWS Lambda executes your Lambda function, it provisions and manages the resources needed to run your Lambda function. When you create a Lambda function, you specify configuration information, such as the amount of memory and maximum execution time that you want to allow for your Lambda function. When a Lambda function is invoked, AWS Lambda launches an execution context based on the configuration settings you provide. The execution context is a temporary runtime environment that initializes any external dependencies of your Lambda function code, such as database connections or HTTP endpoints. This affords subsequent invocations better performance because there is no need to ""cold-start"" or initialize those external dependencies, as explained below.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"It takes time to set up an execution context and do the necessary ""bootstrapping"", which adds some latency each time the Lambda function is invoked. You typically see this latency when a Lambda function is invoked for the first time or after it has been updated because AWS Lambda tries to reuse the execution context for subsequent invocations of the Lambda function.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"After a Lambda function is executed, AWS Lambda maintains the execution context for some time in anticipation of another Lambda function invocation. In effect, the service freezes the execution context after a Lambda function completes, and thaws the context for reuse, if AWS Lambda chooses to reuse the context when the Lambda function is invoked again. This execution context reuse approach has the following implications:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Any declarations in your Lambda function code (outside the handler code, see Programming Model) remains initialized, providing additional optimization when the function is invoked again. For example, if your Lambda function establishes a database connection, instead of reestablishing the connection, the original connection is used in subsequent invocations. We suggest adding logic in your code to check if a connection exists before creating one.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Each execution context provides 512 MB of additional disk space in the /tmp directory. The directory content remains when the execution context is frozen, providing transient cache that can be used for multiple invocations. You can add extra code to check if the cache has the data that you stored. For information on deployment limits, see AWS Lambda Limits.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Background processes or callbacks initiated by your Lambda function that did not complete when the function ended resume if AWS Lambda chooses to reuse the execution context. You should make sure any background processes or callbacks in your code are complete before the code exits.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"When you write your Lambda function code, do not assume that AWS Lambda automatically reuses the execution context for subsequent function invocations. Other factors may dictate a need for AWS Lambda to create a new execution context, which can lead to unexpected results, such as database connection failures.     "
Amazon Lambda,Runtime Support Policy     
Amazon Lambda,"AWS Lambda runtimes are built around a combination of operating system, programming language, and software libraries that are subject to maintenance and security updates. When a component of a runtime is no longer supported for security updates, Lambda deprecates the runtime.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Deprecation occurs in two phases. During the first phase, you can no longer create functions that use the deprecated runtime. For at least 30 days, you can continue to update existing functions that use the deprecated runtime. After this period, both function creation and updates are disabled permanently. However, the function continues to be available to process invocation events.     "

Amazon Lambda,"In most cases, the end-of-life date of a language version or operating system is known well in advance. If you have functions running on a runtime that will be deprecated in the next 60 days, Lambda notifies you by email that you should prepare by migrating your function to a supported runtime. In some cases, such as security issues that require a backwards-incompatible update, or software that doesn't support a long-term support (LTS) schedule, advance notice might not be possible.     "

Amazon Lambda,"After a runtime is deprecated, Lambda might retire it completely at any time by disabling invocation. Deprecated runtimes aren't eligible for security updates or technical support. Before retiring a runtime, Lambda sends additional notifications to affected customers. No runtimes are scheduled to be retired at this time.     "
Amazon Lambda,Custom AWS Lambda Runtimes     
Amazon Lambda,You can implement an AWS Lambda runtime in any programming language. A runtime is a program that runs a Lambda function's handler method when the function is invoked. You can include a runtime in your function's deployment package in the form of an executable file named bootstrap.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"A runtime is responsible for running the function's setup code, reading the handler name from an environment variable, and reading invocation events from the Lambda runtime API. The runtime passes the event data to the function handler, and posts the response from the handler back to Lambda.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Your custom runtime runs in the standard Lambda execution environment. It can be a shell script, a script in a language that's included in Amazon Linux, or a binary executable file that's compiled in Amazon Linux.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"To get started with custom runtimes, see Tutorial – Publishing a Custom Runtime. You can also explore a custom runtime implemented in C++ at awslabs/aws-lambda-cpp on GitHub.     "

Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Building a Custom Runtime     
Amazon Lambda,"A custom runtime's entry point is an executable file named bootstrap. The bootstrap file can be the runtime, or it can invoke another file that creates the runtime. The following example uses a bundled version of Node.js to execute a JavaScript runtime in a separate file named runtime.js.     "

Amazon Lambda,Your runtime code is responsible for completing some initialization tasks. Then it processes invocation events in a loop until it's terminated. The initialization tasks run once per instance of the function to prepare the environment to handle invocations.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Initialization Tasks     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Retrieve settings – Read environment variables to get details about the function and environment.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"_HANDLER – The location to the handler, from the function's configuration. The standard format is file.method, where file is the name of the file without an extension, and method is the name of a method or function that's defined in the file.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT – The directory that contains the function code.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,AWS_LAMBDA_RUNTIME_API – The host and port of the runtime API.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,See Environment Variables Available to Lambda Functions for a full list of available variables.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Initialize the function – Load the handler file and run any global or static code that it contains. Functions should create static resources like SDK clients and database connections once, and reuse them for multiple invocations.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Handle errors – If an error occurs, call the initialization error API and exit immediately.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Initialization counts towards billed execution time and timeout. When an execution triggers the initialization of a new instance of your function, you can see the initialization time in the logs and AWS X-Ray trace.     "

Amazon Lambda,Tutorial – Publishing a Custom Runtime     
Amazon Lambda,"In this tutorial, you create a Lambda function with a custom runtime. You start by including the runtime in the function's deployment package. Then you migrate it to a layer that you manage independently from the function. Finally, you share the runtime layer with the world by updating its resource-based permissions policy.     "

Amazon Lambda,"An AWS Lambda application is a combination of Lambda functions, event sources, and other resources that work together to perform tasks. You can use AWS CloudFormation and other tools to collect your application's components into a single package that can be deployed and managed as one resource. Applications make your Lambda projects portable and enable you to integrate with additional developer tools, such as AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, and the AWS Serverless Application Model command line interface (SAM CLI).     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The AWS Serverless Application Repository provides a collection of Lambda applications that you can deploy in your account with a few clicks. The repository includes both ready-to-use applications and samples that you can use as a starting point for your own projects. You can also submit your own projects for inclusion.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"AWS CloudFormation enables you to create a template that defines your application's resources and lets you manage the application as a stack. You can more safely add or modify resources in your application stack. If any part of an update fails, AWS CloudFormation automatically rolls back to the previous configuration. With AWS CloudFormation parameters, you can create multiple environments for your application from the same template.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) is an extension for the AWS CloudFormation template language that lets you define serverless applications at a higher level. It abstracts away common tasks such as function role creation, which makes it easier to write templates. AWS SAM is supported directly by AWS CloudFormation, and includes additional functionality through the AWS CLI and AWS SAM CLI.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The AWS CLI and AWS SAM CLI are command line tools for managing Lambda application stacks. In addition to commands for managing application stacks with the AWS CloudFormation API, the AWS CLI supports higher-level commands that simplify tasks like uploading deployment packages and updating templates.

Amazon Lambda,Best Practices for Working with AWS Lambda Functions     
Amazon Lambda,The following are recommended best practices for using AWS Lambda:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Topics     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Function Code     
Amazon Lambda,Function Configuration     
Amazon Lambda,Alarming and Metrics     
Amazon Lambda,Stream Event Invokes     
Amazon Lambda,Async Invokes     
Amazon Lambda,Lambda VPC     
Amazon Lambda,Function Code     
Amazon Lambda,Separate the Lambda handler (entry point) from your core logic. This allows you to make a more unit-testable function. In Node.js this may look like:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"exports.myHandler = function(event, context, callback) {     "
Amazon Lambda, var foo = event.foo;    
Amazon Lambda, var bar = event.bar;    
Amazon Lambda," var result = MyLambdaFunction (foo, bar);    "
Amazon Lambda,      
Amazon Lambda," callback(null, result);    "
Amazon Lambda,}     
Amazon Lambda,      
Amazon Lambda,"function MyLambdaFunction (foo, bar) {     "
Amazon Lambda, // MyLambdaFunction logic here    
Amazon Lambda,}     
Amazon Lambda,"Take advantage of Execution Context reuse to improve the performance of your function. Make sure any externalized configuration or dependencies that your code retrieves are stored and referenced locally after initial execution. Limit the re-initialization of variables/objects on every invocation. Instead use static initialization/constructor, global/static variables and singletons. Keep alive and reuse connections (HTTP, database, etc.) that were established during a previous invocation.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Use AWS Lambda Environment Variables to pass operational parameters to your function. For example, if you are writing to an Amazon S3 bucket, instead of hard-coding the bucket name you are writing to, configure the bucket name as an environment variable.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Control the dependencies in your function's deployment package. The AWS Lambda execution environment contains a number of libraries such as the AWS SDK for the Node.js and Python runtimes (a full list can be found here: AWS Lambda Runtimes). To enable the latest set of features and security updates, Lambda will periodically update these libraries. These updates may introduce subtle changes to the behavior of your Lambda function. To have full control of the dependencies your function uses, we recommend packaging all your dependencies with your deployment package.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Minimize your deployment package size to its runtime necessities. This will reduce the amount of time that it takes for your deployment package to be downloaded and unpacked ahead of invocation. For functions authored in Java or .NET Core, avoid uploading the entire AWS SDK library as part of your deployment package. Instead, selectively depend on the modules which pick up components of the SDK you need (e.g. DynamoDB, Amazon S3 SDK modules and Lambda core libraries).     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Reduce the time it takes Lambda to unpack deployment packages authored in Java by putting your dependency .jar files in a separate /lib directory. This is faster than putting all your function’s code in a single jar with a large number of .class files. See AWS Lambda Deployment Package in Java for instructions.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Minimize the complexity of your dependencies. Prefer simpler frameworks that load quickly on Execution Context startup. For example, prefer simpler Java dependency injection (IoC) frameworks like Dagger or Guice, over more complex ones like Spring Framework.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Avoid using recursive code in your Lambda function, wherein the function automatically calls itself until some arbitrary criteria is met. This could lead to unintended volume of function invocations and escalated costs. If you do accidentally do so, set the function concurrent execution limit to 0 immediately to throttle all invocations to the function, while you update the code.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Function Configuration     
Amazon Lambda,"Performance testing your Lambda function is a crucial part in ensuring you pick the optimum memory size configuration. Any increase in memory size triggers an equivalent increase in CPU available to your function. The memory usage for your function is determined per-invoke and can be viewed in AWS CloudWatch Logs. On each invoke a REPORT: entry will be made, as shown below:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,REPORT RequestId: 3604209a-e9a3-11e6-939a-754dd98c7be3 Duration: 12.34 ms Billed Duration: 100 ms Memory Size: 128 MB Max Memory Used: 18 MB  
Amazon Lambda,"By analyzing the Max Memory Used: field, you can determine if your function needs more memory or if you over-provisioned your function's memory size.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Load test your Lambda function to determine an optimum timeout value. It is important to analyze how long your function runs so that you can better determine any problems with a dependency service that may increase the concurrency of the function beyond what you expect. This is especially important when your Lambda function makes network calls to resources that may not handle Lambda's scaling.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Use most-restrictive permissions when setting IAM policies. Understand the resources and operations your Lambda function needs, and limit the execution role to these permissions. For more information, see AWS Lambda Permissions.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Be familiar with AWS Lambda Limits. Payload size, file descriptors and /tmp space are often overlooked when determining runtime resource limits.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Delete Lambda functions that you are no longer using. By doing so, the unused functions won't needlessly count against your deployment package size limit.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If you are using Amazon Simple Queue Service as an event source, make sure the value of the function's expected execution time does not exceed the Visibility Timeout value on the queue. This applies both to CreateFunction and UpdateFunctionConfiguration.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"In the case of CreateFunction, AWS Lambda will fail the function creation process.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"In the case of UpdateFunctionConfiguration, it could result in duplicate invocations of the function.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Alarming and Metrics     
Amazon Lambda,"Use AWS Lambda Metrics and CloudWatch Alarms instead of creating or updating a metric from within your Lambda function code. It's a much more efficient way to track the health of your Lambda functions, allowing you to catch issues early in the development process. For instance, you can configure an alarm based on the expected duration of your Lambda function execution time in order to address any bottlenecks or latencies attributable to your function code.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Leverage your logging library and AWS Lambda Metrics and Dimensions to catch app errors (e.g. ERR, ERROR, WARNING, etc.)     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Stream Event Invokes     
Amazon Lambda,"Test with different batch and record sizes so that the polling frequency of each event source is tuned to how quickly your function is able to complete its task. BatchSize controls the maximum number of records that can be sent to your function with each invoke. A larger batch size can often more efficiently absorb the invoke overhead across a larger set of records, increasing your throughput.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"When there are not enough records to process, instead of waiting, the stream processing function will be invoked with a smaller number of records.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Increase Kinesis stream processing throughput by adding shards. A Kinesis stream is composed of one or more shards. Lambda will poll each shard with at most one concurrent invocation. For example, if your stream has 100 active shards, there will be at most 100 Lambda function invocations running concurrently. Increasing the number of shards will directly increase the number of maximum concurrent Lambda function invocations and can increase your Kinesis stream processing throughput. If you are increasing the number of shards in a Kinesis stream, make sure you have picked a good partition key (see Partition Keys) for your data, so that related records end up on the same shards and your data is well distributed.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Use Amazon CloudWatch on IteratorAge to determine if your Kinesis stream is being processed. For example, configure a CloudWatch alarm with a maximum setting to 30000 (30 seconds).     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Async Invokes     
Amazon Lambda,Create and use AWS Lambda Function Dead Letter Queues to address and replay async function errors.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Lambda VPC     
Amazon Lambda,The following diagram guides you through a decision tree as to whether you should use a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Don't put your Lambda function in a VPC unless you have to. There is no benefit outside of using this to access resources you cannot expose publicly, like a private Amazon Relational Database instance. Services like Amazon Elasticsearch Service can be secured over IAM with access policies, so exposing the endpoint publicly is safe and wouldn't require you to run your function in the VPC to secure it.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Lambda creates elastic network interfaces (ENIs) in your VPC to access your internal resources. Before requesting a concurrency increase, ensure you have enough ENI capacity (the formula for this can be found here: Configuring a Lambda Function to Access Resources in an Amazon VPC) and IP address space. If you do not have enough ENI capacity, you will need to request an increase. If you do not have enough IP address space, you may need to create a larger subnet.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Create dedicated Lambda subnets in your VPC:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"This will make it easier to apply a custom route table for NAT Gateway traffic without changing your other private/public subnets. For more information, see Configuring a Lambda Function to Access Resources in an Amazon VPC     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,This also allows you to dedicate an address space to Lambda without sharing it with other resources.     
Amazon Lambda,Using AWS Lambda with Other Services     
Amazon Lambda,"AWS Lambda integrates with other AWS services to invoke functions. You can configure triggers to invoke a function in response to resource lifecycle events, respond to incoming HTTP requests, consume events from a queue, or run on a schedule.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Each service that integrates with Lambda sends data to your function in JSON as an event. The structure of the event document is different for each event type, and contains data about the resource or request that triggered the function. Lambda runtimes convert the event into an object and pass it to your function.     "

Amazon Lambda,Amazon API Gateway also adds a layer between your application users and your app logic that enables the following:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Ability to throttle individual users or requests.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Protect against Distributed Denial of Service attacks.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Provide a caching layer to cache response from your Lambda function.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note the following about how the Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda integration works:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Push-event model – This is a model (see AWS Lambda Event Source Mapping), where Amazon API Gateway invokes the Lambda function by passing data in the request body as parameter to the Lambda function.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Synchronous invocation – The Amazon API Gateway can invoke the Lambda function and get a response back in real time by specifying RequestResponse as the invocation type. For information about invocation types, see Invocation Types.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Event structure – The event your Lambda function receives is the body from the HTTPS request that Amazon API Gateway receives and your Lambda function is the custom code written to process the specific event type.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note that there are two types of permissions policies that you work with when you set up the end-to-end experience:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Permissions for your Lambda function – Regardless of what invokes a Lambda function, AWS Lambda executes the function by assuming the IAM role (execution role) that you specify at the time you create the Lambda function. Using the permissions policy associated with this role, you grant your Lambda function the permissions that it needs. For example, if your Lambda function needs to read an object, you grant permissions for the relevant Amazon S3 actions in the permissions policy. For more information, see AWS Lambda Execution Role.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Permission for Amazon API Gateway to invoke your Lambda function – Amazon API Gateway cannot invoke your Lambda function without your permission. You grant this permission via the permission policy associated with the Lambda function.     
Amazon Lambda,Tutorial: Using AWS Lambda with Amazon API Gateway     
Amazon Lambda,"In this example you create a simple API using Amazon API Gateway. An Amazon API Gateway is a collection of resources and methods. For this tutorial, you create one resource (DynamoDBManager) and define one method (POST) on it. The method is backed by a Lambda function (LambdaFunctionOverHttps). That is, when you call the API through an HTTPS endpoint, Amazon API Gateway invokes the Lambda function.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The POST method on the DynamoDBManager resource supports the following DynamoDB operations:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Create, update, and delete an item.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Read an item.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Scan an item.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Other operations (echo, ping), not related to DynamoDB, that you can use for testing.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The request payload you send in the POST request identifies the DynamoDB operation and provides necessary data. For example:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The following is a sample request payload for a DynamoDB create item operation:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,{

Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Pass through the entire request – A Lambda function can receive the entire HTTP request (instead of just the request body) and set the HTTP response (instead of just the response body) using the AWS_PROXY integration type.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Catch-all methods – Map all methods of an API resource to a single Lambda function with a single mapping, using the ANY catch-all method.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Catch-all resources – Map all sub-paths of a resource to a Lambda function without any additional configuration using the new path parameter ({proxy+}).

Amazon Lambda,Using AWS Lambda with AWS CloudTrail     
Amazon Lambda,"AWS CloudTrail is a service that provides a record of actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service. CloudTrail captures API calls as events. For an ongoing record of events in your AWS account, you create a trail. A trail enables CloudTrail to deliver log files of events to an Amazon S3 bucket.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You can take advantage of Amazon S3's bucket notification feature and direct Amazon S3 to publish object-created events to AWS Lambda. Whenever CloudTrail writes logs to your S3 bucket, Amazon S3 can then invoke your Lambda function by passing the Amazon S3 object-created event as a parameter. The S3 event provides information, including the bucket name and key name of the log object that CloudTrail created. Your Lambda function code can read the log object and process the access records logged by CloudTrail. For example, you might write Lambda function code to notify you if specific API call was made in your account.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"In this scenario, CloudTrail writes access logs to your S3 bucket. As for AWS Lambda, Amazon S3 is the event source so Amazon S3 publishes events to AWS Lambda and invokes your Lambda function.     "

Amazon Lambda,Tutorial: Using AWS Lambda with AWS CloudTrail     
Amazon Lambda,"In this scenario, AWS CloudTrail will maintain records (logs) of AWS API calls made on your account and notify you anytime an API call is made to create an SNS topic. As API calls are made in your account, CloudTrail writes logs to an Amazon S3 bucket that you configured. In this scenario, you want Amazon S3 to publish the object-created events to AWS Lambda and invoke your Lambda function as CloudTrail creates log objects.     "
Amazon Lambda,

Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,AWS CloudTrail saves logs to an S3 bucket (object-created event).     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Amazon S3 detects the object-created event.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Amazon S3 publishes the s3:ObjectCreated:* event to AWS Lambda by invoking the Lambda function, as specified in the bucket notification configuration. Because the Lambda function's access permissions policy includes permissions for Amazon S3 to invoke the function, Amazon S3 can invoke the function.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda executes the Lambda function by assuming the execution role that you specified at the time you created the Lambda function.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The Lambda function reads the Amazon S3 event it receives as a parameter, determines where the CloudTrail object is, reads the CloudTrail object, and then it processes the log records in the CloudTrail object.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If the log includes a record with specific eventType and eventSource values, it publishes the event to your Amazon SNS topic. In Tutorial: Using AWS Lambda with AWS CloudTrail, you subscribe to the SNS topic using the email protocol, so you get email notifications.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"When Amazon S3 invokes your Lambda function, it passes an S3 event identifying, among other things, the bucket name and key name of the object that CloudTrail created. Your Lambda function can read the log object, and it knows the API calls that were reported in the log.     "

For example, you can automatically invoke an AWS Lambda function to log the state of an EC2 instance or AutoScaling Group.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You maintain event source mapping in Amazon CloudWatch Events by using a rule target definition. For more information, see the PutTargets operation in the Amazon CloudWatch Events API Reference.     "
Amazon Lambda,

Amazon Lambda,Using AWS Lambda with Amazon CloudWatch Logs     
Amazon Lambda,You can use a Lambda function to monitor and analyze logs from an Amazon CloudWatch Logs log stream. Create subscriptions for one or more log streams to invoke a function when logs are created or match an optional pattern. Use the function to send a notification or persist the log to a database or storage.     
Amazon Lambda,

Amazon Lambda,Configuring a Stream as an Event Source     
Amazon Lambda,"Create an event source mapping to tell Lambda to send records from your data stream to a Lambda function. You can create multiple event source mappings to process the same data with multiple Lambda functions, or process items from multiple data streams with a single function.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"To configure your function to read from Kinesis in the Lambda console, create a Kinesis trigger.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,To create a trigger     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Open the Lambda console Functions page.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Choose a function.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Under Designer, choose a trigger type to add a trigger to your function.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Under Configure triggers, configure the required options and then choose Add.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Choose Save.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Lambda supports the following options for Kinesis event sources.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Event Source Options     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Kinesis stream – The Kinesis stream to read records from.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Consumer (optional) – Use a stream consumer to read from the stream over a dedicated connection.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Batch size – The number of records to read from a shard in each batch, up to 10,000. Lambda passes all of the records in the batch to the function in a single call, as long as the total size of the events doesn't exceed the payload limit for synchronous invocation (6 MB).     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Starting position – Process only new records, all existing records, or records created after a certain date.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Latest – Process new records that are added to the stream.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Trim horizon – Process all records in the stream.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,At timestamp – Process records starting from a specific time.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"After processing any existing records, the function is caught up and continues to process new records.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Enabled – Disable the event source to stop processing records. Lambda keeps track of the last record processed and resumes processing from that point when it's re-enabled.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"To manage the event source configuration later, choose the trigger in the designer.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Event Source Mapping APIs     
Amazon Lambda,"To create the event source mapping with the AWS CLI, use the CreateEventSourceMapping API. The following example uses the AWS CLI to map a function named my-function to a Kinesis data stream. The data stream is specified by an Amazon Resource Name (ARN), with a batch size of 500, starting from the timestamp in Unix time.     "

Amazon Lambda,}     
Amazon Lambda,"To use a consumer, specify the consumer's ARN instead of the stream's ARN.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Amazon CloudWatch Metrics     
Amazon Lambda,"Lambda emits the IteratorAge metric when your function finishes processing a batch of records. The metric indicates how old the last record in the batch was when processing finished. If your function is processing new events, you can use the iterator age to estimate the latency between when a record is added, and when the function processes it.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"An increasing trend in iterator age can indicate issues with your function. For more information, see Monitoring and Troubleshooting Lambda Applications.     "
Amazon Lambda,Tutorial: Using AWS Lambda with Amazon Kinesis     
Amazon Lambda,"In this tutorial, you create a Lambda function to consume events from a Kinesis stream. The following diagram illustrates the application flow:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Custom app writes records to the stream.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"AWS Lambda polls the stream and, when it detects new records in the stream, invokes your Lambda function.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda executes the Lambda function by assuming the execution role you specified at the time you created the Lambda function.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Prerequisites     
Amazon Lambda,"This tutorial assumes that you have some knowledge of basic Lambda operations and the Lambda console. If you haven't already, follow the instructions in Getting Started with AWS Lambda to create your first Lambda function.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"To follow the procedures in this guide, you will need a command line terminal or shell to run commands. Commands are shown in listings preceded by a prompt symbol ($) and the name of the current directory, when appropriate:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,~/lambda-project$ this is a command     
Amazon Lambda,this is output     
Amazon Lambda,"For long commands, an escape character (\) is used to split a command over multiple lines.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"On Linux and macOS, use your preferred shell and package manager. On Windows 10, you can install the Windows Subsystem for Linux to get a Windows-integrated version of Ubuntu and Bash.     "

Amazon Lambda,Note the following about how the Amazon S3 and AWS Lambda integration works:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Non-stream based (async) model – This is a model (see AWS Lambda Event Source Mapping), where Amazon S3 monitors a bucket and invokes the Lambda function by passing the event data as a parameter. In a push model, you maintain event source mapping within Amazon S3 using the bucket notification configuration. In the configuration, you specify the event types that you want Amazon S3 to monitor and which AWS Lambda function you want Amazon S3 to invoke. For more information, see Configuring Amazon S3 Event Notifications in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Asynchronous invocation – AWS Lambda invokes a Lambda function using the Event invocation type (asynchronous invocation). For more information about invocation types, see Invocation Types.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Event structure – The event your Lambda function receives is for a single object and it provides information, such as the bucket name and object key name.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note that there are two types of permissions policies that you work with when you set up the end-to-end experience:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Permissions for your Lambda function – Regardless of what invokes a Lambda function, AWS Lambda executes the function by assuming the IAM role (execution role) that you specify at the time you create the Lambda function. Using the permissions policy associated with this role, you grant your Lambda function the permissions that it needs. For example, if your Lambda function needs to read an object, you grant permissions for the relevant Amazon S3 actions in the permissions policy. For more information, see AWS Lambda Execution Role.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Permissions for Amazon S3 to invoke your Lambda function – Amazon S3 cannot invoke your Lambda function without your permission. You grant this permission via the permissions policy associated with the Lambda function.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The following diagram summarizes the flow:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,User uploads an object to an S3 bucket (object-created event).     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Amazon S3 detects the object-created event.

Amazon Lambda,AWS SDK for JavaScript in Node.js     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"gm, GraphicsMagick for node.js     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Async utility module     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The AWS Lambda runtime already has the AWS SDK for JavaScript in Node.js, so you only need to install the other libraries. Open a command prompt, navigate to the examplefolder, and install the libraries using the npm command, which is part of Node.js.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,$ npm install async gm     
Amazon Lambda,Save the sample code to a file named index.js.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Review the preceding code and note the following:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The function knows the source bucket name and the key name of the object from the event data it receives as parameters. If the object is a .jpg, the code creates a thumbnail and saves it to the target bucket.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The code assumes that the destination bucket exists and its name is a concatenation of the source bucket name followed by the string resized. For example, if the source bucket identified in the event data is examplebucket, the code assumes you have an examplebucketresized destination bucket.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For the thumbnail it creates, the code derives its key name as the concatenation of the string resized- followed by the source object key name. For example, if the source object key is sample.jpg, the code creates a thumbnail object that has the key resized-sample.jpg.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Save the file as index.js in examplefolder. After you complete this step, you will have the following folder structure:     "

Amazon Lambda,Zip the index.js file and the node_modules folder as CreateThumbnail.zip.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Java 8     
Amazon Lambda,"The following is example Java code that reads incoming Amazon S3 events and creates a thumbnail. Note that it implements the RequestHandler interface provided in the aws-lambda-java-core library. Therefore, at the time you create a Lambda function you specify the class as the handler (that is, example.S3EventProcessorCreateThumbnail). For more information about using interfaces to provide a handler, see Leveraging Predefined Interfaces for Creating Handler (Java).     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The S3Event type that the handler uses as the input type is one of the predefined classes in the aws-lambda-java-events  library that provides methods for you to easily read information from the incoming Amazon S3 event. The handler returns a string as output.

Amazon Lambda,Using AWS Lambda with Amazon SNS     
Amazon Lambda,"You can write Lambda functions to process Amazon Simple Notification Service notifications. When a message is published to an Amazon SNS topic, the service can invoke your Lambda function by passing the message payload as a parameter. Your Lambda function code can then process the event, for example publish the message to other Amazon SNS topics, or send the message to other AWS services.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"When a user calls the SNS Publish API on a topic that your Lambda function is subscribed to, Amazon SNS will call Lambda to invoke your function asynchronously. Lambda will then return a delivery status. If there was an error calling Lambda, Amazon SNS will retry invoking the Lambda function up to three times. After three tries, if Amazon SNS still could not successfully invoke the Lambda function, then Amazon SNS will send a delivery status failure message to CloudWatch.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"In order to perform cross account Amazon SNS deliveries to Lambda, you need to authorize your Lambda function to be invoked from Amazon SNS. In turn, Amazon SNS needs to allow the Lambda account to subscribe to the Amazon SNS topic. For example, if the Amazon SNS topic is in account A and the Lambda function is in account B, both accounts must grant permissions to the other to access their respective resources. Since not all the options for setting up cross-account permissions are available from the AWS console, you use the AWS CLI to set up the entire process.     "

Amazon Lambda,"Lambda uses long polling to poll a queue until it becomes active. When messages are available, Lambda increases the rate at which it reads batches, and invokes your function until it reaches a concurrency limit. For more information on how Lambda scales to process messages in your Amazon SQS queue, see Understanding Scaling Behavior.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"When Lambda reads a message from the queue, it stays in the queue but becomes hidden until Lambda deletes it. If your function returns an error, or doesn't finish processing before the queue's visibility timeout, it becomes visible again. Then Lambda sends it to your Lambda function again. All messages in a failed batch return to the queue, so your function code must be able to process the same message multiple times without side effects.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Configuring a Queue for Use With Lambda     
Amazon Lambda,Create a standard Amazon SQS queue to serve as an event source for your Lambda function. Then configure the queue to allow time for your Lambda function to process each batch of events—and for Lambda to retry in response to throttling errors as it scales up.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"To allow your function time to process each batch of records, set the source queue's visibility timeout to at least 6 times the timeout that you configure on your function. The extra time allows for Lambda to retry if your function execution is throttled while your function is processing a previous batch.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If a message fails processing multiple times, Amazon SQS can send it to a dead letter queue. Configure a dead letter queue on your source queue to retain messages that failed processing for troubleshooting. Set the maxReceiveCount on the queue's redrive policy to at least 5 to avoid sending messages to the dead letter queue due to throttling.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Execution Role Permissions     
Amazon Lambda,Lambda needs the following permissions to manage messages in your Amazon SQS queue. Add them to your function's execution role.

Amazon Lambda,Configuring a Queue as an Event Source     
Amazon Lambda,"Create an event source mapping to tell Lambda to send items from your queue to a Lambda function. You can create multiple event source mappings to process items from multiple queues with a single function. When Lambda invokes the target function, the event can contain multiple items, up to a configurable maximum batch size.     "

Amazon Lambda,Event Source Options     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,SQS queue – The Amazon SQS queue to read records from.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Batch size – The number of items to read from the queue in each batch, up to 10. The event may contain fewer items if the batch that Lambda read from the queue had fewer items.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Enabled – Disable the event source to stop processing items.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"To manage the event source configuration later, choose the trigger in the designer.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Configure your function timeout to allow enough time to process an entire batch of items. If items take a long time to process, choose a smaller batch size. A large batch size can improve efficiency for workloads that are very fast or have a lot of overhead. However, if your function returns an error, all items in the batch return to the queue. If you configure reserved concurrency on your function, set a minimum of 5 concurrent executions to reduce the chance of throttling errors when Lambda invokes your function.     "

Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The Lambda console uses AWS Cloud9 to provide an integrated development environment in the browser. You can also use AWS Cloud9 to develop Lambda functions in your own environment. For more information, see Working with AWS Lambda Functions in the AWS Cloud9 user guide.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The index.js file exports a function named handler that takes an event object and a context object. This is the handler function that Lambda calls when the function is invoked. The Node.js function runtime gets invocation events from Lambda and passes them to the handler.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Each time you save your function code, the Lambda console creates a deployment package, which is a ZIP archive that contains your function code. As your function development progresses, you will want to store your function code in source control, add libraries, and automate deployments. Start by creating a deployment package and updating your code at the command line.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The function runtime passes a context object to the handler, in addition to the invocation event. The context object contains additional information about the invocation, the function, and the execution environment. More information is available from environment variables.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Your Lambda function comes with a CloudWatch Logs log group. The function runtime sends details about each invocation to CloudWatch Logs. It relays any logs that your function outputs during invocation. If your function returns an error, Lambda formats the error and returns it to the invoker.     "

Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda Function Handler in Node.js     
Amazon Lambda,"The handler is the method in your Lambda function that processes events. When you invoke a function, the runtime runs the handler method. When the handler exits or returns a response, it becomes available to handle another event.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The following example function logs the contents of the event object and returns the location of the logs.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Example index.js File     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"exports.handler =  async function(event, context) {     "
Amazon Lambda,"  console.log(""EVENT: \n"" + JSON.stringify(event, null, 2))     "
Amazon Lambda,  return context.logStreamName     
Amazon Lambda,}     
Amazon Lambda,"When you configure a function, the value of the handler setting is the file name and the name of the exported handler module, separated by a dot. The default in the console and for examples in this guide is index.handler. This indicates the handler module that's exported by index.js.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The runtime passes three arguments to the handler method. The first argument is the event object, which contains information from the invoker. The invoker passes this information as a JSON-formatted string when it calls Invoke. When an AWS service invokes your function, the event structure varies by service.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The second argument is the context object, which contains information about the invocation, function, and execution environment. In the preceding example, the function gets the name of the log stream from the context object and returns it to the invoker.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The third argument, callback, is a function that you can call in non-async functions to send a response. The callback function takes two arguments: an Error and a response. The response object must be compatible with JSON.stringify.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For async functions, you return a response, error, or promise to the runtime instead of using callback.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Async Functions     
Amazon Lambda,"For async functions, you can use return and throw to send a response or error, respectively. Functions must use the async keyword to use these methods to return a response or error.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If your code performs an asynchronous task, return a promise to make sure that it finishes running. When you resolve or reject the promise, Lambda sends the response or error to the invoker.     "

Amazon Lambda,"  }).on('error', (e) => {     "
Amazon Lambda,    callback(Error(e))     
Amazon Lambda,  })     
Amazon Lambda,}     
Amazon Lambda,"For non-async functions, function execution continues until the event loop is empty or the function times out. The response isn't sent to the invoker until all event loop tasks are finished. If the function times out, an error is returned instead. You can configure the runtime to send the response immediately by setting context.callbackWaitsForEmptyEventLoop to false.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"In the following example, the response from Amazon S3 is returned to the invoker as soon as it's available. The timeout running on the event loop is frozen, and it continues running the next time the function is invoked.     "

Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda Deployment Package in Node.js     
Amazon Lambda,"A deployment package is a ZIP archive that contains your function code and dependencies. You need to create a deployment package if you use the Lambda API to manage functions, or if you need to include libraries and dependencies other than the AWS SDK. You can upload the package directly to Lambda, or you can use an Amazon S3 bucket, and then upload it to Lambda. If the deployment package is larger than 50 MB, you must use Amazon S3.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If you use the Lambda console editor to author your function, the console manages the deployment package. You can use this method as long as you don't need to add any libraries. You can also use it to update a function that already has libraries in the deployment package, as long as the total size doesn't exceed 3 MB.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,

Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda Function Handler in Python     
Amazon Lambda,"At the time you create a Lambda function, you specify a handler, which is a function in your code, that AWS Lambda can invoke when the service executes your code. Use the following general syntax structure when creating a handler function in Python.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"def handler_name(event, context):      "
Amazon Lambda,    ...     
Amazon Lambda,    return some_value     
Amazon Lambda,"In the syntax, note the following:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"event – AWS Lambda uses this parameter to pass in event data to the handler. This parameter is usually of the Python dict type. It can also be list, str, int, float, or NoneType type.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,context – AWS Lambda uses this parameter to provide runtime information to your handler. This parameter is of the LambdaContext type.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Optionally, the handler can return a value. What happens to the returned value depends on the invocation type you use when invoking the Lambda function:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If you use the RequestResponse invocation type (synchronous execution), AWS Lambda returns the result of the Python function call to the client invoking the Lambda function (in the HTTP response to the invocation request, serialized into JSON). For example, AWS Lambda console uses the RequestResponse invocation type, so when you invoke the function using the console, the console will display the returned value.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If the handler returns NONE, AWS Lambda returns null.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If you use the Event invocation type (asynchronous execution), the value is discarded.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For example, consider the following Python example code.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"def my_handler(event, context):     "
Amazon Lambda,"    message = 'Hello {} {}!'.format(event['first_name'],      "
Amazon Lambda,                                    event['last_name'])       
Amazon Lambda,    return {      
Amazon Lambda,        'message' : message

Amazon Lambda,This example has one function called my_handler. The function returns a message containing data from the event it received as input.     
Amazon Lambda,WS Lambda Deployment Package in Python     
Amazon Lambda,"A deployment package is a ZIP archive that contains your function code and dependencies. You need to create a deployment package if you use the Lambda API to manage functions, or if you need to include libraries and dependencies other than the AWS SDK. You can upload the package directly to Lambda, or you can use an Amazon S3 bucket, and then upload it to Lambda. If the deployment package is larger than 50 MB, you must use Amazon S3.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If you use the Lambda console editor to author your function, the console manages the deployment package. You can use this method as long as you don't need to add any libraries. You can also use it to update a function that already has libraries in the deployment package, as long as the total size doesn't exceed 3 MB.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,You can use the AWS SAM CLI build command to create a deployment package for your Python function code and dependencies. The AWS SAM CLI also provides an option to build your deployment package inside a Docker image that is compatible with the Lambda execution environment.

Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda Function Errors in Python     
Amazon Lambda,"If your Lambda function raises an exception, AWS Lambda recognizes the failure and serializes the exception information into JSON and returns it. Consider the following example:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"def always_failed_handler(event, context):     "
Amazon Lambda,    raise Exception('I failed!')

Amazon Lambda,}     
Amazon Lambda,Note that the stack trace is returned as the stackTrace JSON array of stack trace elements.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,How you get the error information back depends on the invocation type that the client specifies at the time of function invocation:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If a client specifies the RequestResponse invocation type (that is, synchronous execution), it returns the result to the client that made the invoke call.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For example, the console always use the RequestResponse invocation type, so the console will display the error in the Execution result section as shown:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The same information is also sent to CloudWatch and the Log output section shows the same logs.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If a client specifies the Event invocation type (that is, asynchronous execution), AWS Lambda will not return anything. Instead, it logs the error information to CloudWatch Logs. You can also see the error metrics in CloudWatch Metrics.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Depending on the event source, AWS Lambda may retry the failed Lambda function. For example, if Kinesis is the event source, AWS Lambda will retry the failed invocation until the Lambda function succeeds or the records in the stream expire.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,To test the preceding Python code (console)     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"In the console, create a Lambda function using the hello-world blueprint. In runtime, choose Python 3.7. In Handler, replace lambda_function.lambda_handler with lambda_function.always_failed_handler. For instructions on how to do this, see Create a Lambda Function with the Console.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Replace the template code with the code provided in this section.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Test the Lambda function using the Sample event template called Hello World provided in the Lambda console.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Function Error Handling     
Amazon Lambda,"You can create custom error handling to raise an exception directly from your Lambda function and handle it directly (Retry or Catch) within an AWS Step Functions State Machine. For more information, see Handling Error Conditions Using a State Machine.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Consider a CreateAccount state is a task that writes a customer's details to a database using a Lambda function.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If the task succeeds, an account is created and a welcome email is sent.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If a user tries to create an account for a username that already exists, the Lambda function raises an error, causing the state machine to suggest a different username and to retry the account-creation process.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The following code samples demonstrate how to do this. Note that custom errors in Python must extend the Exception class.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,class AccountAlreadyExistsException(Exception): pass     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"def create_account(event, context):     "
Amazon Lambda,    raise AccountAlreadyExistsException('Account is in use!')     
Amazon Lambda,You can configure Step Functions to catch the error using a Catch rule. Lambda automatically sets the error name to the simple class name of the exception at runtime:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,{     
Amazon Lambda,"   ""StartAt"": ""CreateAccount"",     "
Amazon Lambda,"   ""States"": {     "
Amazon Lambda,"      ""CreateAccount"": {     "

Amazon Lambda,      …     
Amazon Lambda,   }     
Amazon Lambda,}     
Amazon Lambda,"At runtime, AWS Step Functions catches the error, transitioning to the SuggestAccountName state as specified in the Next transition.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Custom error handling makes it easier to create serverless applications. This feature integrates with all the languages supported by the Lambda Programming Model, allowing you to design your application in the programming languages of your choice, mixing and matching as you go.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"To learn more about creating your own serverless applications using AWS Step Functions and AWS Lambda, see AWS Step Functions.     "
Amazon Lambda,Instrumenting Python Code in AWS Lambda     
Amazon Lambda,"In Python, you can have Lambda emit subsegments to X-Ray to show you information about downstream calls to other AWS services made by your function. To do so, you first need to include the the AWS X-Ray SDK for Python in your deployment package. In addition, you can patch the boto3 (or botocore if you are using sessions), so any client you create to access other AWS services will automatically be traced by X-Ray.     "

Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The Lambda console uses AWS Cloud9 to provide an integrated development environment in the browser. You can also use AWS Cloud9 to develop Lambda functions in your own environment. For more information, see Working with AWS Lambda Functions in the AWS Cloud9 user guide.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The lambda_function.rb file exports a function named lambda_handler that takes an event object and a context object. This is the handler function that Lambda calls when the function is invoked. The Ruby function runtime gets invocation events from Lambda and passes them to the handler.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Each time you save your function code, the Lambda console creates a deployment package, which is a ZIP archive that contains your function code. As your function development progresses, you will want to store your function code in source control, add libraries, and automate deployments. Start by creating a deployment package and updating your code at the command line.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The function runtime passes a context object to the handler, in addition to the invocation event. The context object contains additional information about the invocation, the function, and the execution environment. More information is available from environment variables.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Your Lambda function comes with a CloudWatch Logs log group. The function runtime sends details about each invocation to CloudWatch Logs. It relays any logs that your function outputs during invocation. If your function returns an error, Lambda formats the error and returns it to the invoker.     "

Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda Function Handler in Ruby     
Amazon Lambda,"Your Lambda function's handler is the method that Lambda calls when your function is invoked. In the following example, the file function.rb defines a handler method named handler. The handler function takes two objects as input and returns a JSON document.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Example function.rb     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,require 'json'     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"def handler(event:, context:)     "
Amazon Lambda,"    { event: JSON.generate(event), context: JSON.generate(context.inspect) }     "
Amazon Lambda,end     
Amazon Lambda,"In your function configuration, the handler setting tells Lambda where to find the handler. For the preceding example, the correct value for this setting is function.handler. It includes two names separated by a dot: the name of the file and the name of the handler method.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,You can also define your handler method in a class. The following example defines a handler method named process on a class named Handler in a module named LambdaFunctions.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Example source.rb     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,module LambdaFunctions     
Amazon Lambda,  class Handler     
Amazon Lambda,"    def self.process(event:,context:)     "
Amazon Lambda,"      ""Hello!""     "
Amazon Lambda,    end     
Amazon Lambda,  end     
Amazon Lambda,end     
Amazon Lambda,"In this case, the handler setting is source.LambdaFunctions::Handler.process.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The two objects that the handler accepts are the invocation event and context. The event is a Ruby object that contains the payload that's provided by the invoker. If the payload is a JSON document, the event object is a Ruby hash. Otherwise, it's a string. The context object has methods and properties that provide information about the invocation, the function, and the execution environment.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The function handler is executed every time your Lambda function is invoked. Static code outside of the handler is executed once per instance of the function. If your handler uses resources like SDK clients and database connections, you can create them outside of the handler method to reuse them for multiple invocations.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Each instance of your function can process multiple invocation events, but it only processes one event at a time. The number of instances processing an event at any given time is your function's concurrency. For more information about the Lambda execution context, see AWS Lambda Execution Context.     "
Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda Deployment Package in Ruby     
Amazon Lambda,"A deployment package is a ZIP archive that contains your function code and dependencies. You need to create a deployment package if you use the Lambda API to manage functions, or if you need to include libraries and dependencies other than the AWS SDK. You can upload the package directly to Lambda, or you can use an Amazon S3 bucket, and then upload it to Lambda. If the deployment package is larger than 50 MB, you must use Amazon S3.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If you use the Lambda console editor to author your function, the console manages the deployment package. You can use this method as long as you don't need to add any libraries. You can also use it to update a function that already has libraries in the deployment package, as long as the total size doesn't exceed 3 MB.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"To keep your deployment package size low, package your function's dependencies in layers. Layers let you manage your dependencies independently, can be used by multiple functions, and can be shared with other accounts. For details, see AWS Lambda Layers.     "
Amazon Lambda,

Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"aws-lambda-java-core – This library provides the Context object, RequestStreamHandler, and the RequestHandler interfaces. The Context object (AWS Lambda Context Object in Java) provides runtime information about your Lambda function. The predefined interfaces provide one way of defining your Lambda function handler. For more information, see Leveraging Predefined Interfaces for Creating Handler (Java).     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"aws-lambda-java-events – This library provides predefined types that you can use when writing Lambda functions to process events published by Amazon S3, Kinesis, Amazon SNS, and Amazon Cognito. These classes help you process the event without having to write your own custom serialization logic.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Custom Appender for Log4j2.8 – You can use the custom Log4j (see Apache Log4j 2) appender provided by AWS Lambda for logging from your lambda functions. Every call to Log4j methods, such as log.info() or log.error(), will result in a CloudWatch Logs event. The custom appender is called LambdaAppender and must be used in the log4j2.xml file. You must include the aws-lambda-java-log4j2 artifact (artifactId:aws-lambda-java-log4j2) in the deployment package (.jar file).For more information, see AWS Lambda Function Logging in Java.     "

Amazon Lambda,Authoring Lambda Functions Using Eclipse IDE and AWS SDK Plugin (Java)     
Amazon Lambda,"AWS SDK Eclipse Toolkit provides an Eclipse plugin for you to both create a deployment package and also upload it to create a Lambda function. If you can use Eclipse IDE as your development environment, this plugin enables you to author Java code, create and upload a deployment package, and create your Lambda function. For more information, see the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse Getting Started Guide. For an example of using the toolkit for authoring Lambda functions, see Using AWS Lambda with the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse.     "
Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda Function Handler in Java     
Amazon Lambda,At the time you create a Lambda function you specify a handler that AWS Lambda can invoke when the service executes the Lambda function on your behalf.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Lambda supports two approaches for creating a handler:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Loading the handler method directly without having to implement an interface. This section describes this approach.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Implementing standard interfaces provided as part of aws-lambda-java-core library (interface approach). For more information, see Leveraging Predefined Interfaces for Creating Handler (Java).     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The general syntax for the handler is as follows:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"outputType handler-name(inputType input, Context context) {     "
Amazon Lambda,   ...     
Amazon Lambda,}     
Amazon Lambda,In order for AWS Lambda to successfully invoke a handler it must be invoked with input data that can be serialized into the data type of the input parameter.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"In the syntax, note the following:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"inputType – The first handler parameter is the input to the handler, which can be event data (published by an event source) or custom input that you provide such as a string or any custom data object. In order for AWS Lambda to successfully invoke this handler, the function must be invoked with input data that can be serialized into the data type of the input parameter.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"outputType – If you plan to invoke the Lambda function synchronously (using the RequestResponse invocation type), you can return the output of your function using any of the supported data types. For example, if you use a Lambda function as a mobile application backend, you are invoking it synchronously. Your output data type will be serialized into JSON.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If you plan to invoke the Lambda function asynchronously (using the Event invocation type), the outputType should be void. For example, if you use AWS Lambda with event sources such as Amazon S3 or Amazon SNS, these event sources invoke the Lambda function using the Event invocation type.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The inputType and outputType can be one of the following:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Primitive Java types (such as String or int).     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Predefined AWS event types defined in the aws-lambda-java-events library.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,For example S3Event is one of the POJOs predefined in the library that provides methods for you to easily read information from the incoming Amazon S3 event.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,You can also write your own POJO class. AWS Lambda will automatically serialize and deserialize input and output JSON based on the POJO type.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For more information, see Handler Input/Output Types (Java).     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You can omit the Context object from the handler method signature if it isn't needed. For more information, see AWS Lambda Context Object in Java.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For example, consider the following Java example code.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,package example;     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,import com.amazonaws.services.lambda.runtime.Context;      
Amazon Lambda,import com.amazonaws.services.lambda.runtime.RequestHandler;     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"public class Hello implements RequestHandler<Integer, String>{     "
Amazon Lambda,"    public String myHandler(int myCount, Context context) {     "
Amazon Lambda,        return String.valueOf(myCount);     
Amazon Lambda,    }     
Amazon Lambda,}     
Amazon Lambda,"In this example input is of type Integer and output is of type String. If you package this code and dependencies, and create your Lambda function, you specify example.Hello::myHandler (package.class::method-reference) as the handler.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"In the example Java code, the first handler parameter is the input to the handler (myHandler), which can be event data (published by an event source such as Amazon S3) or custom input you provide such as an Integer object (as in this example) or any custom data object.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For instructions to create a Lambda function using this Java code, see Create a Lambda Function Authored in Java.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Handler Overload Resolution     
Amazon Lambda,"If your Java code contains multiple methods with same name as the handler name, then AWS Lambda uses the following rules to pick a method to invoke:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Select the method with the largest number of parameters.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If two or more methods have the same number of parameters, AWS Lambda selects the method that has the Context as the last parameter.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If none or all of these methods have the Context parameter, then the behavior is undefined.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Additional Information     
Amazon Lambda,The following topics provide more information about the handler.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For more information about the handler input and output types, see Handler Input/Output Types (Java).     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For information about using predefined interfaces to create a handler, see Leveraging Predefined Interfaces for Creating Handler (Java).     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If you implement these interfaces, you can validate your handler method signature at compile time.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If your Lambda function throws an exception, AWS Lambda records metrics in CloudWatch indicating that an error occurred. For more information, see AWS Lambda Function Errors in Java.     "
Amazon Lambda,Handler Input/Output Types (Java)     
Amazon Lambda,"When AWS Lambda executes the Lambda function, it invokes the handler. The first parameter is the input to the handler which can be event data (published by an event source) or custom input you provide such as a string or any custom data object.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda supports the following input/output types for a handler:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Simple Java types (AWS Lambda supports the String, Integer, Boolean, Map, and List types)     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,POJO (Plain Old Java Object) type     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Stream type (If you do not want to use POJOs or if Lambda's serialization approach does not meet your needs, you can use the byte stream implementation. For more information, see Example: Using Stream for Handler Input/Output (Java).)     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Handler Input/Output: String Type     
Amazon Lambda,The following Java class shows a handler called myHandler that uses String type for input and output.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,package example;     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,import com.amazonaws.services.lambda.runtime.Context;      
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,public class Hello {     
Amazon Lambda,"    public String myHandler(String name, Context context) {     "
Amazon Lambda,"        return String.format(""Hello %s."", name);     "
Amazon Lambda,    }     
Amazon Lambda,}     
Amazon Lambda,You can have similar handler functions for other simple Java types.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"When you invoke a Lambda function asynchronously, any return value by your Lambda function will be ignored. Therefore you might want to set the return type to void to make this clear in your code. For more information, see Invoke.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"To test an end-to-end example, see Create a Lambda Function Authored in Java.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Handler Input/Output: POJO Type     
Amazon Lambda,The following Java class shows a handler called myHandler that uses POJOs for input and output.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,package example;     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,import com.amazonaws.services.lambda.runtime.Context;      
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,public class HelloPojo {     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,    // Define two classes/POJOs for use with Lambda function.     
Amazon Lambda,    public static class RequestClass {     
Amazon Lambda,      ...     
Amazon Lambda,    }     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,    public static class ResponseClass {     
Amazon Lambda,      ...     
Amazon Lambda,    }     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"    public static ResponseClass myHandler(RequestClass request, Context context) {     "
Amazon Lambda,"        String greetingString = String.format(""Hello %s, %s."", request.getFirstName(), request.getLastName());     "
Amazon Lambda,        return new ResponseClass(greetingString);     
Amazon Lambda,    }     
Amazon Lambda,}     
Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda serializes based on standard bean naming conventions (see The Java EE 6 Tutorial). You should use mutable POJOs with public getters and setters.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You shouldn't rely on any other features of serialization frameworks such as annotations. If you need to customize the serialization behavior, you can use the raw byte stream to use your own serialization.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If you use POJOs for input and output, you need to provide implementation of the RequestClass and ResponseClass types. For an example, see Example: Using POJOs for Handler Input/Output (Java).     "
Amazon Lambda,Example: Using POJOs for Handler Input/Output (Java)     
Amazon Lambda,Suppose your application events generate data that includes first name and last name as shown:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"{ ""firstName"": ""John"", ""lastName"": ""Doe"" }       "
Amazon Lambda,"For this example, the handler receives this JSON and returns the string ""Hello John Doe"".     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"public static ResponseClass handleRequest(RequestClass request, Context context){     "
Amazon Lambda,"        String greetingString = String.format(""Hello %s, %s."", request.firstName, request.lastName);     "
Amazon Lambda,        return new ResponseClass(greetingString);     
Amazon Lambda,}     
Amazon Lambda,"To create a Lambda function with this handler, you must provide implementation of the input and output types as shown in the following Java example. The HelloPojo class defines the handler method.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,package example;     
Amazon Lambda,

Amazon Lambda,}     
Amazon Lambda,Note that the stack trace is returned as the stackTrace JSON array of stack trace elements.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The method in which you get the error information back depends on the invocation type that you specified at the time you invoked the function:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"RequestResponse invocation type (that is, synchronous execution): In this case, you get the error message back.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For example, if you invoke a Lambda function using the Lambda console, the RequestResponse is always the invocation type and the console displays the error information returned by AWS Lambda in the Execution result section as shown in the following image.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Event invocation type (that is, asynchronous execution): In this case AWS Lambda does not return anything. Instead, it logs the error information in CloudWatch Logs and CloudWatch metrics.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Depending on the event source, AWS Lambda may retry the failed Lambda function. For example, if Kinesis is the event source for the Lambda function, AWS Lambda retries the failed function until the Lambda function succeeds or the records in the stream expire.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Function Error Handling     
Amazon Lambda,"You can create custom error handling to raise an exception directly from your Lambda function and handle it directly (Retry or Catch) within an AWS Step Functions State Machine. For more information, see Handling Error Conditions Using a State Machine.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Consider a CreateAccount state is a task that writes a customer's details to a database using a Lambda function.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If the task succeeds, an account is created and a welcome email is sent.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If a user tries to create an account for a username that already exists, the Lambda function raises an error, causing the state machine to suggest a different username and to retry the account-creation process.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The following code samples demonstrate how to do this. Note that custom errors in Java must extend the Exception class.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,package com.example;      
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,public static class AccountAlreadyExistsException extends Exception {     
Amazon Lambda,    public AccountAlreadyExistsException(String message) {

Amazon Lambda,"        throw new AccountAlreadyExistsException (""Account is in use!"");     "
Amazon Lambda,    }     
Amazon Lambda,}     
Amazon Lambda,You can configure Step Functions to catch the error using a Catch rule. Lambda automatically sets the error name to the fully-qualified class name of the exception at runtime:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,{     
Amazon Lambda,"   ""StartAt"": ""CreateAccount"",     "
Amazon Lambda,"   ""States"": {     "

Amazon Lambda,"To learn more about creating your own serverless applications using AWS Step Functions and AWS Lambda, see AWS Step Functions.     "
Amazon Lambda,Instrumenting Java Code in AWS Lambda     
Amazon Lambda,"In Java, you can have Lambda emit subsegments to X-Ray to show you information regarding downstream calls to other AWS services made by your function. To take advantage of this capability, include the AWS X-Ray SDK for Java in your deployment package. No code changes are needed. As long as you are using an AWS SDK version 1.11.48 or later, there is no need to add any additional code lines for downstream calls from your function to be traced.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The AWS SDK will dynamically import the X-Ray SDK to emit subsegments for downstream calls made by your function. By using the X-Ray SDK for Java, you can instrument your code in order to emit custom subsegments and or add annotations to your X-Ray segments.     "

Amazon Lambda,Create a Lambda Function Authored in Java     
Amazon Lambda,"The blueprints provide sample code authored either in Python or Node.js. You can easily modify the example using the inline editor in the console. However, if you want to author code for your Lambda function in Java, there are no blueprints provided. Also, there is no inline editor for you to write Java code in the AWS Lambda console.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"That means, you must write your Java code and also create your deployment package outside the console. After you create the deployment package, you can use the console to upload the package to AWS Lambda to create your Lambda function. You can also use the console to test the function by manually invoking it.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,In this section you create a Lambda function using the following Java code example.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,package example;     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,import com.amazonaws.services.lambda.runtime.Context;      
Amazon Lambda,import com.amazonaws.services.lambda.runtime.LambdaLogger;     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,public class Hello {     
Amazon Lambda,"    public String myHandler(int myCount, Context context) {     "
Amazon Lambda,        LambdaLogger logger = context.getLogger();     
Amazon Lambda,"        logger.log(""received : "" + myCount);     "
Amazon Lambda,        return String.valueOf(myCount);     
Amazon Lambda,    }     
Amazon Lambda,}     
Amazon Lambda,"The programming model explains how to write your Java code in detail, for example the input/output types AWS Lambda supports. For more information about the programming model, see Building Lambda Functions with Java. For now, note the following about this code:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"When you package and upload this code to create your Lambda function, you specify the example.Hello::myHandler method reference as the handler.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The handler in this example uses the int type for input and the String type for output.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"AWS Lambda supports input/output of JSON-serializable types and InputStream/OutputStream types. When you invoke this function you will pass a sample int (for example, 123).     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,You can use the Lambda console to manually invoke this Lambda function. The console always uses the RequestResponse invocation type (synchronous) and therefore you will see the response in the console.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The handler includes the optional Context parameter. In the code we use the LambdaLogger provided by the Context object to write log entries to CloudWatch logs. For information about using the Context object, see AWS Lambda Context Object in Java.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"First, you need to package this code and any dependencies into a deployment package. Then, you can use the Getting Started exercise to upload the package to create your Lambda function and test using the console.

Amazon Lambda,Valid Handler Signatures     
Amazon Lambda,"You have several options when building a Lambda function handler in Go, but you must adhere to the following rules:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The handler must be a function.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The handler may take between 0 and 2 arguments. If there are two arguments, the first argument must implement context.Context.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The handler may return between 0 and 2 arguments. If there is a single return value, it must implement error. If there are two return values, the second value must implement error. For more information on implementing error-handling information, see AWS Lambda Function Errors in Go.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The following lists valid handler signatures. TIn and TOut represent types compatible with the encoding/json standard library. For more information, see func Unmarshal to learn how these types are deserialized.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,func ()     
Amazon Lambda,func () error     
Amazon Lambda,"func (TIn), error     "
Amazon Lambda,"func () (TOut, error)     "
Amazon Lambda,func (context.Context) error     
Amazon Lambda,"func (context.Context, TIn) error     "
Amazon Lambda,"func (context.Context) (TOut, error)     "
Amazon Lambda,"func (context.Context, TIn) (TOut, error)     "
Amazon Lambda,Using Global State     
Amazon Lambda,"You can declare and modify global variables that are independent of your Lambda function's handler code. In addition, your handler may declare an init function that is executed when your handler is loaded. This behaves the same in AWS Lambda as it does in standard Go programs. A single instance of your Lambda function will never handle multiple events simultaneously. This means, for example, that you may safely change global state, assured that those changes will require a new Execution Context and will not introduce locking or unstable behavior from function invocations directed at the previous Execution Context.

Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Accessing Invoke Context Information     
Amazon Lambda,"Lambda functions have access to metadata about their environment and the invocation request. This can be accessed at Package context. Should your handler include context.Context as a parameter, Lambda will insert information about your function into the context's Value property. Note that you need to import the lambdacontext library to access the contents of the context.Context object.     "

Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda Function Errors in Go     
Amazon Lambda,You can create custom error handling to raise an exception directly from your Lambda function and handle it directly.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The following code samples demonstrate how to do this. Note that custom errors in Go must import the errors module.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,package main     
Amazon Lambda,      
Amazon Lambda,import (     
Amazon Lambda,"        ""errors""     "
Amazon Lambda,"        ""github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/lambda""     "

Amazon Lambda,      
Amazon Lambda,func main() {     
Amazon Lambda,        lambda.Start(OnlyErrors)     
Amazon Lambda,}     
Amazon Lambda,Which returns the following:     
Amazon Lambda,

Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If the task succeeds, an account is created and a welcome email is sent.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If a user tries to create an account for a username that already exists, the Lambda function raises an error, causing the state machine to suggest a different username and to retry the account-creation process.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The following code samples demonstrate how to do this.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,package main

Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Handling Unexpected Errors     
Amazon Lambda,"Lambda functions can fail for reasons beyond your control, such as network outages. These are exceptional circumstances. In Go, panic addresses these issues. If your code panics, Lambda will attempt to capture the error and serialize it into the standard error json format. Lambda will also attempt to insert the value of the panic into the function's CloudWatch logs. After returning the response, Lambda will re-create the function automatically. If you find it necessary, you can include the panic function in your code to customize the error response.     "

Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda Deployment Package in C#     
Amazon Lambda,"A .NET Core Lambda deployment package is a zip file of your function's compiled assembly along with all of its assembly dependencies. The package also contains a proj.deps.json file. This signals to the .NET Core runtime all of your function's dependencies and a proj.runtimeconfig.json file, which is used to configure the .NET Core runtime. The .NET CLI’s publish command can create a folder with all of these files, but by default the proj.runtimeconfig.json will not be included because a Lambda project is typically configured to be a class library. To force the proj.runtimeconfig.json to be written as part of the publish process, pass in the command line argument: /p:GenerateRuntimeConfigurationFiles=true to the publish command.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Although it is possible to create the deployment package with the dotnet publish command, we suggest you create the deployment package with either the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio or the .NET Core CLI.

Amazon Lambda,Serializing Lambda Functions

Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,T Deserialize<T>(Stream requestStream);     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,You implement this method to deserialize the request payload from the Invoke API into the object that is passed to the Lambda function handler.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"T Serialize<T>(T response, Stream responseStream);.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,You implement this method to serialize the result returned from the Lambda function handler into the response payload that is returned by the Invoke API.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,You use whichever serializer you wish by adding it as a dependency to your MyProject.csproj file.

Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda Function Handler in C#     
Amazon Lambda,"When you create a Lambda function, you specify a handler that AWS Lambda can invoke when the service executes the function on your behalf.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You define a Lambda function handler as an instance or static method in a class. If you want access to the Lambda context object, it is available by defining a method parameter of type ILambdaContext, an interface you can use to access information about the current execution, such as the name of the current function, the memory limit, execution time remaining, and logging.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"returnType handler-name(inputType input, ILambdaContext context) {     "
Amazon Lambda,   ...     
Amazon Lambda,}     
Amazon Lambda,"In the syntax, note the following:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"inputType – The first handler parameter is the input to the handler, which can be event data (published by an event source) or custom input that you provide such as a string or any custom data object.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"returnType – If you plan to invoke the Lambda function synchronously (using the RequestResponse invocation type), you can return the output of your function using any of the supported data types. For example, if you use a Lambda function as a mobile application backend, you are invoking it synchronously. Your output data type will be serialized into JSON.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If you plan to invoke the Lambda function asynchronously (using the Event invocation type), the returnType should be void. For example, if you use AWS Lambda with event sources such as Amazon S3 or Amazon SNS, these event sources invoke the Lambda function using the Event invocation type.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Handling Streams     
Amazon Lambda,Only the System.IO.Stream type is supported as an input parameter by default.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For example, consider the following C# example code.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,using System.IO;     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,namespace Example     
Amazon Lambda,{                 
Amazon Lambda,  public class Hello     
Amazon Lambda,  {     
Amazon Lambda,    public Stream MyHandler(Stream stream)     
Amazon Lambda,    {     
Amazon Lambda,       //function logic     
Amazon Lambda,    }     
Amazon Lambda,}     
Amazon Lambda,"In the example C# code, the first handler parameter is the input to the handler (MyHandler), which can be event data (published by an event source such as Amazon S3) or custom input you provide such as a Stream (as in this example) or any custom data object. The output is of type Stream.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Handling Standard Data Types     
Amazon Lambda,"All other types, as listed below, require you to specify a serializer.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Primitive .NET types (such as string or int).     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Collections and maps - IList, IEnumerable, IList<T>, Array, IDictionary, IDictionary<TKey, TValue>     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,POCO types (Plain old CLR objects)     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Predefined AWS event types     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,For asynchronous invocations the return-type will be ignored by Lambda. The return type may be set to void in such cases.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If you are using .NET asynchronous programming, the return type can be Task and Task<T> types and use async and await keywords. For more information, see Using Async in C# Functions with AWS Lambda.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Unless your function input and output parameters are of type System.IO.Stream, you will need to serialize them. AWS Lambda provides a default serializer that can be applied at the assembly or method level of your application, or you can define your own by implementing the ILambdaSerializer interface provided by the Amazon.Lambda.Core library. For more information, see AWS Lambda Deployment Package in C#.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"To add the default serializer attribute to a method, first add a dependency on Amazon.Lambda.Serialization.Json in your project.json file.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,{     
Amazon Lambda,"    ""version"": ""1.0.0-*"",     "

Amazon Lambda,        }     
Amazon Lambda,    }     
Amazon Lambda,}     
Amazon Lambda,The example below illustrates the flexibility you can leverage by specifying the default Json.NET serializer on one method and another of your choosing on a different method:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,public class ProductService{     
Amazon Lambda,    [LambdaSerializer(typeof(Amazon.Lambda.Serialization.Json.JsonSerializer))]     
Amazon Lambda,    public Product DescribeProduct(DescribeProductRequest request)

Amazon Lambda,    }     
Amazon Lambda,        
Amazon Lambda,   [LambdaSerializer(typeof(MyJsonSerializer))]     
Amazon Lambda,   public Customer DescribeCustomer(DescribeCustomerRequest request)     
Amazon Lambda,   {     
Amazon Lambda,      return customerService.DescribeCustomer(request.Id);     
Amazon Lambda,   }     
Amazon Lambda,}     
Amazon Lambda,Handler Signatures     
Amazon Lambda,"When creating Lambda functions, you have to provide a handler string that tells AWS Lambda where to look for the code to invoke. In C#, the format is:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,ASSEMBLY::TYPE::METHOD where:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"ASSEMBLY is the name of the .NET assembly file for your application. When using the .NET Core CLI to build your application, if you haven't set the assembly name using the buildOptions.outputName setting in project.json, the ASSEMBLY name will be the name of the folder that contains your project.json file. For more information, see .NET Core CLI. In this case, let's assume the folder name is HelloWorldApp.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"TYPE is the full name of the handler type, which consists of the Namespace and the ClassName. In this case Example.Hello.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"METHOD is name of the function handler, in this case MyHandler.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Ultimately, the signature will be of this format: Assembly::Namespace.ClassName::MethodName     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Again, consider the following example:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,using System.IO;     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,namespace Example     
Amazon Lambda,{                 
Amazon Lambda,  public class Hello     
Amazon Lambda,  {     
Amazon Lambda,    public Stream MyHandler(Stream stream)     
Amazon Lambda,    {     
Amazon Lambda,       //function logic     
Amazon Lambda,    }     
Amazon Lambda,}     
Amazon Lambda,The handler string would be: HelloWorldApp::Example.Hello::MyHandler     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Important     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If the method specified in your handler string is overloaded, you must provide the exact signature of the method Lambda should invoke. AWS Lambda will reject an otherwise valid signature if the resolution would require selecting among multiple (overloaded) signatures.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Lambda Function Handler Restrictions     
Amazon Lambda,Note that there are some restrictions on the handler signature.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"It may not be unsafe and use pointer types in the handler signature, though unsafe context can be used inside the handler method and its dependencies. For more information, see unsafe (C# Reference).     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"It may not pass a variable number of parameters using the params keyword, or use ArgIterator as an input or return parameter which is used to support variable number of parameters.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The handler may not be a generic method (e.g. IList<T> Sort<T>(IList<T> input)).     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Async handlers with signature async void are not supported.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Using Async in C# Functions with AWS Lambda     
Amazon Lambda,"If you know your Lambda function will require a long-running process, such as uploading large files to Amazon S3 or reading a large stream of records from DynamoDB, you can take advantage of the async/await pattern. When you use this signature, Lambda executes the function synchronously and waits for the function to return a response or for execution to time out.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,public async Task<Response> ProcessS3ImageResizeAsync(SimpleS3Event input)     
Amazon Lambda,{     
Amazon Lambda,   var response = await client.DoAsyncWork(input);     
Amazon Lambda,   return response;     
Amazon Lambda,}     
Amazon Lambda,"If you use this pattern, there are some considerations you must take into account:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda does not support async void methods.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If you create an async Lambda function without implementing the await operator, .NET will issue a compiler warning and you will observe unexpected behavior. For example, some async actions will execute while others won't. Or some async actions won't complete before the function execution is complete.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,public async Task ProcessS3ImageResizeAsync(SimpleS3Event event) // Compiler warning     
Amazon Lambda,{     
Amazon Lambda,    client.DoAsyncWork(input);      
Amazon Lambda,}     
Amazon Lambda,"Your Lambda function can include multiple async calls, which can be invoked in parallel. You can use the Task.WhenAll and Task.WhenAny methods to work with multiple tasks. To use the Task.WhenAll method, you pass a list of the operations as an array to the method. Note that in the example below, if you neglect to include any operation to the array, that call may return before its operation completes.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,public async Task DoesNotWaitForAllTasks1()

Amazon Lambda,}     
Amazon Lambda,The method in which error information is conveyed depends on the invocation type:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"RequestResponse invocation type (that is, synchronous execution): In this case, you get the error message back.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For example, if you invoke a Lambda function using the Lambda console, the RequestResponse is always the invocation type and the console displays the error information returned by AWS Lambda in the Execution result section of the console.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Event invocation type (that is, asynchronous execution): In this case AWS Lambda does not return anything. Instead, it logs the error information in CloudWatch Logs and CloudWatch metrics.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Depending on the event source, AWS Lambda may retry the failed Lambda function. For more information, see AWS Lambda Retry Behavior.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Function Error Handling     
Amazon Lambda,"You can create custom error handling to raise an exception directly from your Lambda function and handle it directly (Retry or Catch) within an AWS Step Functions State Machine. For more information, see Handling Error Conditions Using a State Machine.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Consider a CreateAccount state is a task that writes a customer's details to a database using a Lambda function.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If the task succeeds, an account is created and a welcome email is sent.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If a user tries to create an account for a username that already exists, the Lambda function raises an error, causing the state machine to suggest a different username and to retry the account-creation process.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The following code samples demonstrate how to do this. Note that custom errors in C# must extend the Exception class.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,namespace Example {                 
Amazon Lambda,   public class AccountAlreadyExistsException : Exception {     
Amazon Lambda,      public AccountAlreadyExistsException(String message) :     
Amazon Lambda,         base(message) {     
Amazon Lambda,      }     
Amazon Lambda,   }     
Amazon Lambda,}      
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,namespace Example {     
Amazon Lambda,   public class Handler {     
Amazon Lambda,     public static void CreateAccount() {     
Amazon Lambda,"       throw new AccountAlreadyExistsException(""Account is in use!"");     "
Amazon Lambda,     }     
Amazon Lambda,   }     
Amazon Lambda,}     
Amazon Lambda,You can configure Step Functions to catch the error using a Catch rule. Lambda automatically sets the error name to the simple class name of the exception at runtime:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,{     
Amazon Lambda,"   ""StartAt"": ""CreateAccount"",     "
Amazon Lambda,"   ""States"": {     "
Amazon Lambda,"      ""CreateAccount"": {     "

Amazon Lambda,"         ""Resource"": ""arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:CreateAccount"",     "
Amazon Lambda,"         ""Next"": ""SendWelcomeEmail"",     "
Amazon Lambda,"         ""Catch"": [     "
Amazon Lambda,            {     
Amazon Lambda,"               ""ErrorEquals"": [""AccountAlreadyExistsException""],     "
Amazon Lambda,"               ""Next"": ""SuggestAccountName""     "
Amazon Lambda,            }

Amazon Lambda,"      },     "
Amazon Lambda,      …     
Amazon Lambda,   }     
Amazon Lambda,}     
Amazon Lambda,"At runtime, AWS Step Functions catches the error, transitioning to the SuggestAccountName state as specified in the Next transition.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Custom error handling makes it easier to create serverless applications. This feature integrates with all the languages supported by the Lambda Programming Model, allowing you to design your application in the programming languages of your choice, mixing and matching as you go.     "

Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda Deployment Package in PowerShell     
Amazon Lambda,"A PowerShell Lambda deployment package is a ZIP file that contains your PowerShell script, PowerShell modules that are required for your PowerShell script, and the assemblies needed to host PowerShell Core.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,AWSLambdaPSCore is a PowerShell module that you can install from the PowerShell Gallery. You use this module to create your PowerShell Lambda deployment package.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You're required to use the #Requires statement within your PowerShell scripts to indicate the modules that your scripts depend on. This statement performs two important tasks. 1) It communicates to other developers which modules the script uses, and 2) it identifies the dependent modules that AWS PowerShell tools need to package with the script, as part of the deployment. For more information about the #Requires statement in PowerShell, see About Requires. For more information about PowerShell deployment packages, see AWS Lambda Deployment Package in PowerShell.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"When your PowerShell Lambda function uses the AWS PowerShell cmdlets, be sure to set a #Requires statement that references the AWSPowerShell.NetCore module, which supports PowerShell Core—and not the AWSPowerShell module, which only supports Windows PowerShell. Also, be sure to use version 3.3.270.0 or newer of AWSPowerShell.NetCore, which optimizes the cmdlet import process. If you use an older version, you'll experience longer cold starts.

Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,New-AWSPowerShellLambda -ScriptName MyFirstPSScript -Template Basic     
Amazon Lambda,A new file named MyFirstPSScript.ps1 is created in a new subdirectory of the current directory. The name of the directory is based on the -ScriptName parameter. You can use the -Directory parameter to choose an alternative directory.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,You can see that the new file has the following contents:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,# PowerShell script file to be executed as a AWS Lambda function.      
Amazon Lambda,#      
Amazon Lambda,# When executing in Lambda the following variables will be predefined.     
Amazon Lambda,#   $LambdaInput - A PSObject that contains the Lambda function input data.     
Amazon Lambda,#   $LambdaContext - An Amazon.Lambda.Core.ILambdaContext object that contains information about the currently running Lambda environment.     
Amazon Lambda,#     
Amazon Lambda,# The last item in the PowerShell pipeline will be returned as the result of the Lambda function.     
Amazon Lambda,#     
Amazon Lambda,"# To include PowerShell modules with your Lambda function, like the AWSPowerShell.NetCore module, add a ""#Requires"" statement      "
Amazon Lambda,# indicating the module and version.     
Amazon Lambda,                     
Amazon Lambda,#Requires -Modules @{ModuleName='AWSPowerShell.NetCore';ModuleVersion='3.3.343.0'}     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,# Uncomment to send the input to CloudWatch Logs     
Amazon Lambda,# Write-Host (ConvertTo-Json -InputObject $LambdaInput -Compress -Depth 5)     
Amazon Lambda,Edit the sample script.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"To see how log messages from your PowerShell script are sent to CloudWatch Logs, uncomment the Write-Host line of the sample script.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"To demonstrate how you can return data back from your Lambda functions, add a new line at the end of the script with $PSVersionTable. This adds the $PSVersionTable to the PowerShell pipeline. After the PowerShell script is complete, the last object in the PowerShell pipeline is the return data for the Lambda function. $PSVersionTable is a PowerShell global variable that also provides information about the running environment.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"After making these changes, the last two lines of the sample script look like this:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Write-Host (ConvertTo-Json -InputObject $LambdaInput -Compress -Depth 5)     
Amazon Lambda,$PSVersionTable     
Amazon Lambda,Publish to AWS Lambda.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"After editing the MyFirstPSScript.ps1 file, change the directory to the script's location. Then run the following command to publish the script to AWS Lambda:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Publish-AWSPowerShellLambda -ScriptPath .\MyFirstPSScript.ps1 -Name  MyFirstPSScript -Region us-east-1     
Amazon Lambda,"Note that the -Name parameter specifies the Lambda function name, which appears in the Lambda console. You can use this function to invoke your script manually.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Test the Lambda function.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,You can test the PowerShell Lambda function that you just published by using the dotnet CLI from a command prompt. Use the lambda invoke-function command to invoke your function.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,> dotnet lambda invoke-function MyFirstPSScript     
Amazon Lambda,"For more information about the dotnet CLI extension, see .NET Core CLI.     "
Amazon Lambda,Setting Up a PowerShell Development Environment     
Amazon Lambda,"To set up your development environment for writing PowerShell scripts, do the following:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Install the correct version of PowerShell. Lambda's support for PowerShell is based on the cross-platform PowerShell Core 6.0 release. This means that you can develop your PowerShell Lambda functions on Windows, Linux, or Mac. If you don’t have this version of PowerShell installed, you can find instructions in Installing PowerShell Core.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Install the .NET Core 2.1 SDK. Because PowerShell Core is built on top of .NET Core, the Lambda support for PowerShell uses the same .NET Core 2.1 Lambda runtime for both .NET Core and PowerShell Lambda functions. The .NET Core 2.1 SDK is used by the new Lambda PowerShell publishing cmdlets to create the Lambda deployment package. The .NET Core 2.1 SDK is available at .NET downloads on the Microsoft website. Be sure to install the SDK and not the runtime installation.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Install the AWSLambdaPSCore module. You can install this either from the PowerShell Gallery, or you can install it by using the following PowerShell Core shell command:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Install-Module AWSLambdaPSCore -Scope CurrentUser

Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda Function Handler in PowerShell     
Amazon Lambda,"When a Lambda function is invoked, the Lambda handler invokes the PowerShell script.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"When the PowerShell script is invoked, the following variables are predefined:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"$LambdaInput – A PSObject that contains the input to the handler. This input can be event data (published by an event source) or custom input that you provide, such as a string or any custom data object.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"$LambdaContext – An Amazon.Lambda.Core.ILambdaContext object that you can use to access information about the current execution—such as the name of the current function, the memory limit, execution time remaining, and logging.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For example, consider the following PowerShell example code.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,#Requires -Modules @{ModuleName='AWSPowerShell.NetCore';ModuleVersion='3.3.343.0'}     
Amazon Lambda,Write-Host 'Function Name:' $LambdaContext.FunctionName     
Amazon Lambda,This script returns the FunctionName property that's obtained from the $LambdaContext variable.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You're required to use the #Requires statement within your PowerShell scripts to indicate the modules that your scripts depend on.

For more information, see AWS Tools for PowerShell.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Returning Data     
Amazon Lambda,"Some Lambda invocations are meant to return data back to their caller. For example, if an invocation was in response to a web request coming from API Gateway, then our Lambda function needs to return back the response. For PowerShell Lambda, the last object that's added to the PowerShell pipeline is the return data from the Lambda invocation. If the object is a string, the data is returned as is. Otherwise the object is converted to JSON by using the ConvertTo-Json cmdlet.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For example, consider the following PowerShell statement, which adds $PSVersionTable to the PowerShell pipeline:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,$PSVersionTable     
Amazon Lambda,"After the PowerShell script is finished, the last object in the PowerShell pipeline is the return data for the Lambda function. $PSVersionTable is a PowerShell global variable that also provides information about the running environment.     "
Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda Context Object in PowerShell     
Amazon Lambda,"When Lambda runs your function, it passes context information by making a $LambdaContext variable available to the handler. This variable provides methods and properties with information about the invocation, function, and execution environment.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Context Properties     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,FunctionName – The name of the Lambda function.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,FunctionVersion – The version of the function.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,InvokedFunctionArn – The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that's used to invoke the function. Indicates if the invoker specified a version number or alias.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,MemoryLimitInMB – The amount of memory that's allocated for the function.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,AwsRequestId – The identifier of the invocation request.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,LogGroupName – The log group for the function.

Amazon Lambda,Write-Host 'Log group name:' $LambdaContext.LogGroupName     
Amazon Lambda,Write-Host 'Log stream name:' $LambdaContext.LogStreamName     
Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda Function Logging in PowerShell     
Amazon Lambda,"Your Lambda function comes with a CloudWatch Logs log group, with a log stream for each instance of your function. The runtime sends details about each invocation to the log stream, and relays logs and other output from your function's code.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"To output logs from your function code, you can use cmdlets on Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility , or any logging module that writes to stdout or stderr. The following example uses Write-Host.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Write-Host 'Event received.'     
Amazon Lambda,"The Lambda console shows log output when you test a function on the function configuration page. To view logs for all invocations, use the CloudWatch Logs console.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,To view your Lambda function's logs     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Open the Logs page of the CloudWatch console.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Choose the log group for your function (/aws/lambda/function-name).     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Choose the first stream in the list.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Each log stream corresponds to an instance of your function. New streams appear when you update your function and when additional instances are created to handle multiple concurrent invocations. To find logs for specific invocations, you can instrument your function with X-Ray, and record details about the request and log stream in the trace. For a sample application that correlates logs and traces with X-Ray, see Error Processor Sample Application for AWS Lambda.     "
Amazon Lambda,

Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda Metrics     
Amazon Lambda,"This topic describes the AWS Lambda namespace, metrics, and dimensions. AWS Lambda automatically monitors functions on your behalf, reporting metrics through Amazon CloudWatch. These metrics include total invocations, errors, duration, throttles, DLQ errors and Iterator age for stream-based invocations.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,CloudWatch is basically a metrics repository. A metric is the fundamental concept in CloudWatch and represents a time-ordered set of data points. You (or AWS services) publish metrics data points into CloudWatch and you retrieve statistics about those data points as an ordered set of time-series data.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Metrics are uniquely defined by a name, a namespace, and one or more dimensions. Each data point has a time stamp, and, optionally, a unit of measure. When you request statistics, the returned data stream is identified by namespace, metric name, and dimension. For more information about CloudWatch, see the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda CloudWatch Metrics     
Amazon Lambda,The AWS/Lambda namespace includes the following metrics.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Metric Description    
Amazon Lambda,Invocations     
Amazon Lambda,"Measures the number of times a function is invoked in response to an event or invocation API call. This replaces the deprecated RequestCount metric. This includes successful and failed invocations, but does not include throttled attempts. This equals the billed requests for the function. Note that AWS Lambda only sends these metrics to CloudWatch if they have a nonzero value.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Units: Count     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Errors     
Amazon Lambda,Measures the number of invocations that failed due to errors in the function (response code 4XX). This replaces the deprecated ErrorCount metric. Failed invocations may trigger a retry attempt that succeeds. This includes:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Handled exceptions (for example, context.fail(error))     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Unhandled exceptions causing the code to exit     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Out of memory exceptions     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Timeouts     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Permissions errors     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,This does not include invocations that fail due to invocation rates exceeding default concurrent limits (error code 429) or failures due to internal service errors (error code 500).     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Units: Count     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,DeadLetterErrors     
Amazon Lambda,Incremented when Lambda is unable to write the failed event payload to your configured Dead Letter Queues. This could be due to the following:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Permissions errors     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Throttles from downstream services

Amazon Lambda,Timeouts     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Units: Count     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Duration     
Amazon Lambda,Measures the elapsed wall clock time from when the function code starts executing as a result of an invocation to when it stops executing. The maximum data point value possible is the function timeout configuration. The billed duration will be rounded up to the nearest 100 millisecond. Note that AWS Lambda only sends these metrics to CloudWatch if they have a nonzero value.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Units: Milliseconds     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Throttles     
Amazon Lambda,Measures the number of Lambda function invocation attempts that were throttled due to invocation rates exceeding the customer’s concurrent limits (error code 429). Failed invocations may trigger a retry attempt that succeeds.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Units: Count     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,IteratorAge     
Amazon Lambda,"Emitted for stream-based invocations only (functions triggered by an Amazon DynamoDB stream or Kinesis stream). Measures the age of the last record for each batch of records processed. Age is the difference between the time Lambda received the batch, and the time the last record in the batch was written to the stream.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Units: Milliseconds     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,ConcurrentExecutions     
Amazon Lambda,"Emitted as an aggregate metric for all functions in the account, and for functions that have a custom concurrency limit specified. Not applicable for versions or aliases. Measures the sum of concurrent executions for a given function at a given point in time. Must be viewed as an average metric if aggregated across a time period.     "

Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Errors/Invocations Ratio     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"When calculating the error rate on Lambda function invocations, it’s important to distinguish between an invocation request and an actual invocation. It is possible for the error rate to exceed the number of billed Lambda function invocations. Lambda reports an invocation metric only if the Lambda function code is executed. If the invocation request yields a throttling or other initialization error that prevents the Lambda function code from being invoked, Lambda will report an error, but it does not log an invocation metric.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Lambda emits Invocations=1 when the function is executed. If the Lambda function is not executed, nothing is emitted.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Lambda emits a data point for Errors for each invoke request. Errors=0 means that there is no function execution error. Errors=1 means that there is a function execution error.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Lambda emits a data point for Throttles for each invoke request. Throttles=0 means there is no invocation throttle. Throttles=1 means there is an invocation throttle.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda CloudWatch Dimensions

Amazon Lambda,Using AWS X-Ray     
Amazon Lambda,"A typical Lambda-based application consists of one or more functions triggered by events such as object uploads to Amazon S3, Amazon SNS notifications, and API actions. Once triggered, those functions usually call downstream resources such as DynamoDB tables or Amazon S3 buckets, or make other API calls. AWS Lambda leverages Amazon CloudWatch to automatically emit metrics and logs for all invocations of your function. However, this mechanism might not be convenient for tracing the event source that invoked your Lambda function, or for tracing downstream calls that your function made. For a complete overview of how tracing works, see AWS X-Ray.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Using Environment Variables to Communicate with AWS X-Ray     
Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda uses environment variables to facilitate communication with the X-Ray daemon and configure the X-Ray SDK.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"_X_AMZN_TRACE_ID: Contains the tracing header, which includes the sampling decision, trace ID, and parent segment ID. (To learn more about these properties, see Tracing Header.) If Lambda receives a tracing header when your function is invoked, that header will be used to populate the _X_AMZN_TRACE_ID environment variable. If a tracing header was not received, Lambda will generate one for you.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"AWS_XRAY_CONTEXT_MISSING: The X-Ray SDK uses this variable to determine its behavior in the event that your function tries to record X-Ray data, but a tracing header is not available. Lambda sets this value to LOG_ERROR by default.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"AWS_XRAY_DAEMON_ADDRESS: This environment variable exposes the X-Ray daemon's address in the following format: IP_ADDRESS:PORT. You can use the X-Ray daemon's address to send trace data to the X-Ray daemon directly, without using the X-Ray SDK.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Lambda Traces in the AWS X-Ray Console: Examples     
Amazon Lambda,The following shows Lambda traces for two different Lambda functions. Each trace showcases a trace structure for a different invocation type: asynchronous and synchronous.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Async – The example following shows an asynchronous Lambda request with one successful invocation and one downstream call to DynamoDB.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The Lambda service segment encapsulates the response time, which is the time it took to return a response (for example, 202) to the client. It includes subsegments for the time spent in the Lambda service queue (dwell time) and each invocation attempt. (Only one invocation attempt appears in the example preceding.) Each attempt subsegment in the service segment will have a corresponding user function segment. In this example, the user function segment contains two subsegments: the initialization subsegment representing the function's initialization code that is run before the handler, and a downstream call subsegment representing a ListTables call to DynamoDB.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Status codes and error messages are displayed for each Invocation subsegment and for each downstream call.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Synchronous – The example following shows a synchronous request with one downstream call to Amazon S3.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The Lambda service segment captures the entire time the request spends in the Lambda service. The service segment will have a corresponding User function segment. In this example, the User function segment contains a subsegment representing the function's initialization code (code run before the handler), and a subsegment representing the PutObject call to Amazon S3.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If you want to trace HTTP calls, you need to use an HTTP client. For more information, see Tracing Calls to Downstream HTTP Web Services with the X-Ray SDK for Java or Tracing Calls to Downstream HTTP Web Services with the X-Ray SDK for Node.js .     "
Amazon Lambda,Tracing Lambda-Based Applications with AWS X-Ray     
Amazon Lambda,"AWS X-Ray is an AWS service that allows you to detect, analyze, and optimize performance issues with your AWS Lambda applications. X-Ray collects metadata from the Lambda service and any upstream or downstream services that make up your application. X-Ray uses this metadata to generate a detailed service graph that illustrates performance bottlenecks, latency spikes, and other issues that impact the performance of your Lambda application.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"After using the Lambda on the AWS X-Ray Service Map to identify a problematic resource or component, you can zoom in and view a visual representation of the request. This visual representation covers the time from when an event source triggers a Lambda function until the function execution has completed. X-Ray provides you with a breakdown of your function's operations, such as information regarding downstream calls your Lambda function made to other services. In addition, X-Ray integration with Lambda provides you with visibility into the AWS Lambda service overhead. It does so by displaying specifics such as your request's dwell time and number of invocations.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Only services that currently integrate with X-Ray show as standalone traces, outside of your Lambda trace. For a list of services that currently support X-Ray, see Integrating AWS X-Ray with Other AWS Services.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Lambda on the AWS X-Ray Service Map     
Amazon Lambda,X-Ray displays three types of nodes on the service map for requests served by Lambda:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Lambda service (AWS::Lambda) – This type of node represents the time the request spent in the Lambda service. Timing starts when Lambda first receives the request and ends when the request leaves the Lambda service.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Lambda function (AWS::Lambda::Function) – This type of node represents the Lambda function's execution time.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Downstream service calls – In this type, each downstream service call from within the Lambda function is represented by a separate node.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"In the diagram following, the nodes represent (from left to right): The Lambda service, the user function, and a downstream call to Amazon S3:     "

Amazon Lambda,"For more information, see Viewing the Service Map.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Lambda as an AWS X-Ray Trace     
Amazon Lambda,"From the service map, you can zoom in to see a trace view of your Lambda function. The trace will display in-depth information regarding your function invocations, represented as segments and subsegments:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Lambda service segment – This segment represents different information depending on the event source used to invoke the function:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Synchronous and stream event sources – The service segment measures the time from when the Lambda service receives the request/event and ends when the request leaves the Lambda service (after the final invocation for the request is completed).     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Asynchronous – The service segment represents the response time, that is, the time it took the Lambda service to return a 202 response to the client.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The Lambda service segment can include two types of subsegments:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Dwell time (asynchronous invocations only) – Represents the time the function spends in the Lambda service before being invoked. This subsegment starts when the Lambda service receives the request/event and ends when the Lambda function is invoked for the first time.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Attempt – Represents a single invocation attempt, including any overhead introduced by the Lambda service. Examples of overhead are time spent initializing the function's code and function execution time.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Lambda function segment – Represents execution time for the function for a given invocation attempt. It starts when the function handler starts executing and ends when the function terminates. This segment can include three types of subsegments:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Initialization – The time spent running the initialization code of the function, defined as the code outside the Lambda function handler or static initializers.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Downstream calls – Calls made to other AWS services from the Lambda function's code.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Custom subsegments – Custom subsegments or user annotations that you can add to the Lambda function segment by using the X-Ray SDK.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For each traced invocation, Lambda emits the Lambda service segment and all of its subsegments. These segments are emitted regardless of the runtime and require you to use the X-Ray SDK for AWS API calls.     "

Amazon Lambda,"Pass Through: This is the default setting for all Lambda functions if you have added tracing permissions to your function's execution role. This approach means the Lambda function is only traced if X-Ray has been enabled on an upstream service, such as AWS Elastic Beanstalk.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Active: When a Lambda function has this setting, Lambda automatically samples invocation requests, based on the sampling algorithm specified by X-Ray.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"X-Ray applies a sampling algorithm to ensure that tracing is efficient, while still providing a representative sample of the requests that your application serves. The default sampling algorithm is 1 request per minute, with 5 percent of requests sampled past that limit. However, if the traffic volume to your function is low, you may see an increased rate of sampling.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,You can change the tracing mode for your Lambda function by using either the Lambda Management Console or the Lambda CreateFunction or UpdateFunctionConfiguration API actions.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If you use the Lambda console, the following applies:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"When you change a function's tracing mode to active, tracing permissions are automatically attached to the function's execution role. If you receive an error stating Lambda couldn't add the AWSXrayWriteOnlyAccess policy to your function's execution role, sign in to the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/ and manually add the policy.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"To enable active tracing, go to the Configuration tab your function and select the Enable active tracing box.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,If you use the Lambda CreateFunction or UpdateFunctionConfiguration API actions:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If you want the tracing mode to be active, set the TracingConfig parameter's Mode property to Active. Again, any new function has its tracing mode set to PassThrough by default.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Any new or updated Lambda function has its $LATEST version set to the value you specify.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You receive an error if you haven't added tracing permissions to your function's execution role. For more information, see Before You Begin.     "
Amazon Lambda,Emitting Trace Segments from a Lambda Function     
Amazon Lambda,"For each traced invocation, Lambda will emit the Lambda service segment and all of its subsegments. In addition, Lambda will emit the Lambda function segment and the init subsegment. These segments will be emitted regardless of the function's runtime, and with no code changes or additional libraries required. If you want your Lambda function's X-Ray traces to include custom segments, annotations, or subsegments for downstream calls, you might need to include additional libraries and annotate your code.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note that any instrumentation code must be implemented inside the Lambda function handler and not as part of the initialization code.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The following examples explain how to do this in the supported runtimes:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Instrumenting Python Code in AWS Lambda

Amazon Lambda,Instrumenting Java Code in AWS Lambda     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Instrumenting Go Code in AWS Lambda     
Amazon Lambda,The AWS X-Ray Daemon in the Lambda Environment     
Amazon Lambda,The AWS X-Ray Daemon is a software application that gathers raw segment data and relays it to the AWS X-Ray service. The daemon works in conjunction with the AWS X-Ray SDKs so that data sent by the SDKs can reach the X-Ray service.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"When you trace your Lambda function, the X-Ray daemon automatically runs in the Lambda environment to gather trace data and send it to X-Ray. When tracing, the X-Ray daemon consumes a maximum of 16 MB or 3 percent of your function's memory allocation. For example, if you allocate 128 MB of memory to your Lambda function, the X-Ray daemon has 16 MB of your function's memory allocation. If you allocate 1024 MB to your Lambda function, the X-Ray daemon has 31 MB allocated to it (3 percent). For more information, see The AWS X-Ray Daemon.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Lambda will try to terminate the X-Ray daemon to avoid exceeding your function's memory limit. For example, assume you have allocated 128 MB to your Lambda function, which means the X-Ray daemon will have 16 MB allocated to it. That leaves your Lambda function with a memory allocation of 112 MB. However, if your function exceeds 112 MB, the X-Ray daemon will be terminated to avoid throwing an out-of-memory error.     "
Amazon Lambda,Logging AWS Lambda API Calls with AWS CloudTrail     
Amazon Lambda,"AWS Lambda is integrated with AWS CloudTrail, a service that provides a record of actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service in AWS Lambda. CloudTrail captures API calls for AWS Lambda as events. The calls captured include calls from the AWS Lambda console and code calls to the AWS Lambda API operations. If you create a trail, you can enable continuous delivery of CloudTrail events to an Amazon S3 bucket, including events for AWS Lambda. If you don't configure a trail, you can still view the most recent events in the CloudTrail console in Event history. Using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine the request that was made to AWS Lambda, the IP address from which the request was made, who made the request, when it was made, and additional details.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to configure and enable it, see the AWS CloudTrail User Guide.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda Information in CloudTrail     
Amazon Lambda,"CloudTrail is enabled on your AWS account when you create the account. When supported event activity occurs in AWS Lambda, that activity is recorded in a CloudTrail event along with other AWS service events in Event history. You can view, search, and download recent events in your AWS account. For more information, see Viewing Events with CloudTrail Event History.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For an ongoing record of events in your AWS account, including events for AWS Lambda, you create a trail. A trail enables CloudTrail to deliver log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By default, when you create a trail in the console, the trail applies to all AWS Regions. The trail logs events from all Regions in the AWS partition and delivers the log files to the Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. Additionally, you can configure other AWS services to further analyze and act upon the event data collected in CloudTrail logs. For more information, see the following:     "

For more information, see the userIdentity field in the CloudTrail Event Reference.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You can store your log files in your bucket for as long as you want, but you can also define Amazon S3 lifecycle rules to archive or delete log files automatically. By default, your log files are encrypted by using Amazon S3 server-side encryption (SSE).     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You can choose to have CloudTrail publish Amazon SNS notifications when new log files are delivered if you want to take quick action upon log file delivery. For more information, see Configuring Amazon SNS Notifications for CloudTrail.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You can also aggregate AWS Lambda log files from multiple AWS regions and multiple AWS accounts into a single S3 bucket. For more information, see Working with CloudTrail Log Files.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Understanding AWS Lambda Log File Entries     
Amazon Lambda,"CloudTrail log files contain one or more log entries where each entry is made up of multiple JSON-formatted events. A log entry represents a single request from any source and includes information about the requested action, any parameters, the date and time of the action, and so on. The log entries are not guaranteed to be in any particular order. That is, they are not an ordered stack trace of the public API calls.     "

Amazon Lambda,Using CloudTrail to Track Function Invocations     
Amazon Lambda,"CloudTrail also logs data events. You can turn on data event logging so that you log an event every time Lambda functions are invoked. This helps you understand what identities are invoking the functions and the frequency of their invocations. You can do this using the AWS CloudTrail console or Invoke CLI operation. For more information on this option, see Logging Data and Management Events for Trails.     "
Amazon Lambda,AWS Lambda Troubleshooting Scenarios     
Amazon Lambda,This section describes examples of how to monitor and troubleshoot your Lambda functions using the logging and monitoring capabilities of CloudWatch.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Troubleshooting Scenario 1: Lambda Function Not Working as Expected     
Amazon Lambda,"In this scenario, you have just finished Tutorial: Using AWS Lambda with Amazon S3. However, the Lambda function you created to upload a thumbnail image to Amazon S3 when you create an S3 object is not working as expected. When you upload objects to Amazon S3, you see that the thumbnail images are not being uploaded. You can troubleshoot this issue in the following ways.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,To determine why your Lambda function is not working as expected     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Check your code and verify that it is working correctly. An increased error rate would indicate that it is not.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You can test your code locally as you would any other Node.js function, or you can test it within the Lambda console using the console's test invoke functionality, or you can use the AWS CLI Invoke command. Each time the code is executed in response to an event, it writes a log entry into the log group associated with a Lambda function, which is /aws/lambda/<function name>.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Following are some examples of errors that might show up in the logs:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If you see a stack trace in your log, there is probably an error in your code. Review your code and debug the error that the stack trace refers to.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If you see a permissions denied error in the log, the IAM role you have provided as an execution role may not have the necessary permissions. Check the IAM role and verify that it has all of the necessary permissions to access any AWS resources that your code references. To ensure that you have correctly set up the execution role, see AWS Lambda Execution Role.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If you see a timeout exceeded error in the log, your function was terminated because it did not return prior to the configured timeout. This may be because the timeout is too low, or the code is taking too long to execute.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If you see a memory exceeded error in the log, your memory setting is too low. Set it to a higher value. For information about memory size limits, see CreateFunction.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Check your Lambda function and verify that it is receiving requests.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Even if your function code is working as expected and responding correctly to test invokes, the function may not be receiving requests from Amazon S3. If Amazon S3 is able to invoke the function, you should see an increase in your CloudWatch requests metrics. If you do not see an increase in your CloudWatch requests, check the access permissions policy associated with the function.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Troubleshooting Scenario 2: Increased Duration in Lambda Function Execution     
Amazon Lambda,"In this scenario, you have just finished Tutorial: Using AWS Lambda with Amazon S3. However, the Lambda function you created to upload a thumbnail image to Amazon S3 when you create an S3 object is not working as expected. When you upload objects to Amazon S3, you can see that the thumbnail images are being uploaded, but your code is taking much longer to execute than expected. You can troubleshoot this issue in a couple of different ways. For example, you could monitor the duration metric for the Lambda function to see if the execution time is increasing. Or you could see an increase in the CloudWatch errors metric for the Lambda function, which might be due to timeout errors.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,To determine why there is increased duration in the execution of a Lambda function     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Test your code with different memory settings.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If your code is taking too long to execute, it could be that it does not have enough compute resources to execute its logic. Try increasing the memory allocated to your function and testing the code again, using the Lambda console's test invoke functionality. You can see the memory used, code execution time, and memory allocated in the function log entries. Changing the memory setting can change how you are charged for execution time. For information about pricing, see AWS Lambda.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Use logs to investigate the source of the execution bottleneck     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You can test your code locally, as you would with any other Node.js function, or you can test it within Lambda using the test invoke capability on the Lambda console, or using the asyncInvoke command by using AWS CLI. Each time the code is executed in response to an event, it writes a log entry into the log group associated with a Lambda function, which is named aws/lambda/<function name>. Add logging statements around various parts of your code, such as callouts to other services, to see how much time it takes to execute different parts of your code.     "

Amazon Lambda,CreateFunction     
Amazon Lambda,"Creates a Lambda function. To create a function, you need a deployment package and an execution role. The deployment package contains your function code. The execution role grants the function permission to use AWS services, such as Amazon CloudWatch Logs for log streaming and AWS X-Ray for request tracing.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"A function has an unpublished version, and can have published versions and aliases. The unpublished version changes when you update your function's code and configuration. A published version is a snapshot of your function code and configuration that can't be changed. An alias is a named resource that maps to a version, and can be changed to map to a different version. Use the Publish parameter to create version 1 of your function from its initial configuration.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The other parameters let you configure version-specific and function-level settings. You can modify version-specific settings later with UpdateFunctionConfiguration. Function-level settings apply to both the unpublished and published versions of the function, and include tags (TagResource) and per-function concurrency limits (PutFunctionConcurrency).     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If another account or an AWS service invokes your function, use AddPermission to grant permission by creating a resource-based IAM policy. You can grant permissions at the function level, on a version, or on an alias.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"To invoke your function directly, use Invoke. To invoke your function in response to events in other AWS services, create an event source mapping (CreateEventSourceMapping), or configure a function trigger in the other service. For more information, see Invoking Functions.     "

Amazon Lambda,AWS SDK Support for Amazon S3 Client-Side Encryption     
Amazon Lambda,"The following tables provide lists of cryptographic algorithms and features that are supported by the language–specific AWS SDKs. For details about how to use the features for a particular SDK, see that SDK's developer guide.     "

Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The AWS Encryption SDK is an encryption library that is separate from the language–specific SDKs. You can use this encryption library to more easily implement encryption best practices in your application. Unlike the Amazon S3 encryption clients in the language–specific AWS SDKs, the AWS Encryption SDK is not tied to Amazon S3 and can be used to encrypt or decrypt data to be stored anywhere.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The AWS Encryption SDK and the Amazon S3 encryption clients are not compatible because they produce ciphertexts with different data formats. For more details on the AWS Encryption SDK see the AWS Encryption SDK Developer Guide.

Amazon Lambda,"In the following table, each column indicates whether an AWS SDK for a specific language supports the features used in client-side encryption.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"To use the Amazon S3 client-side encryption feature to encrypt data before uploading to Amazon S3, you must provide a master key to the Amazon S3 encryption client. You can provide a client-side master key or use the AWS KMS–managed master keys feature. The AWS KMS–managed master keys feature provides an easy way to create and manage keys used to encrypt data. For more details about these features, choose the links provided in the Feature column.     "

Amazon Lambda,                 Error Retries and Exponential Backoff in AWS     
Amazon Lambda,"Numerous components on a network, such as DNS servers, switches, load balancers, and others can generate errors anywhere in the life of a given request. The usual technique for dealing with these error responses in a networked environment is to implement retries in the client application. This technique increases the reliability of the application and reduces operational costs for the developer.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Each AWS SDK implements automatic retry logic. The AWS SDK for Java automatically retries requests, and you can configure the retry settings using the ClientConfiguration class. For example, you might want to turn off the retry logic for a web page that makes a request with minimal latency and no retries. Use the ClientConfiguration class and provide a maxErrorRetry value of 0 to turn off the retries.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If you're not using an AWS SDK, you should retry original requests that receive server (5xx) or throttling errors. However, client errors (4xx) indicate that you need to revise the request to correct the problem before trying again.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"In addition to simple retries, each AWS SDK implements exponential backoff algorithm for better flow control. The idea behind exponential backoff is to use progressively longer waits between retries for consecutive error responses. You should implement a maximum delay interval, as well as a maximum number of retries. The maximum delay interval and maximum number of retries are not necessarily fixed values, and should be set based on the operation being performed, as well as other local factors, such as network latency.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Most exponential backoff algorithms use jitter (randomized delay) to prevent successive collisions. Because you aren't trying to avoid such collisions in these cases, you don't need to use this random number. However, if you use concurrent clients, jitter can help your requests succeed faster. For more information, see the blog post for Exponential Backoff and Jitter.     "

For example, a single message published on $aws/things/device/shadow/update topic can result in publishing three additional messages to $aws/things/device/shadow/update/accepted, $aws/things/device/shadow/update/documents, and $aws/things/device/shadow/delta topics. In this case, AWS IoT counts those as 4 inbound publish requests towards this limit. However, a single message to an unreserved topic like a/b is counted only as a single inbound publish request. 20000 Yes  "
Amazon Lambda,"Outbound publish requests per second per account Outbound publish requests count for every message that resulted in matching a client's subscription or matching a rules engine subscription. For example, two clients are subscribed to topic filter a/b and a rule is subscribed to topic filter a/#. An inbound publish request on topic a/b results in a total of 3 outbound publish requests. 20000 Yes  "

Amazon Lambda,Protocol Limits     
Amazon Lambda,Resource Description    
Amazon Lambda,"Connection inactivity (keep-alive interval) For MQTT (or MQTT over WebSockets) connections, a client can request a keep-alive interval between 30 - 1200 seconds as part of the MQTT CONNECT message. AWS IoT starts the keep-alive timer for a client when sending CONNACK in response to the CONNECT message. This timer is reset whenever AWS IoT receives a PUBLISH, SUBSCRIBE, PING, or PUBACK message from the client. AWS IoT will disconnect a client whose keep-alive timer has reached 1.5x the specified keep-alive interval (i.e., by a factor of 1.5).The default keep-alive interval is 1200 seconds. If a client requests a keep-alive interval of zero, the default keep-alive interval will be used. If a client requests a keep-alive interval greater than 1200 seconds, the default keep-alive interval will be used. If a client requests a keep-alive interval shorter than 30 seconds but greater than zero, the server treats the client as though it requested a keep-alive interval of 30 seconds.    "
Amazon Lambda,"WebSocket connection duration WebSocket connections are limited to 24 hours. If the limit is exceeded, the WebSocket connection is automatically closed when an attempt is made to send a message by the client or server.    "

Amazon Lambda,Signing AWS API Requests     
Amazon Lambda,"When you send HTTP requests to AWS, you sign the requests so that AWS can identify who sent them. You sign requests with your AWS access key, which consists of an access key ID and secret access key. Some requests do not need to be signed, such as anonymous requests to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and some API operations in AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) such as AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You need to learn how to sign HTTP requests only when you manually create them. When you use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or one of the AWS SDKs to make requests to AWS, these tools automatically sign the requests for you with the access key that you specify when you configure the tools. When you use these tools, you don't need to learn how to sign requests yourself.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,When Do You Need to Sign Requests?     
Amazon Lambda,"When you write custom code to send HTTP requests to AWS, you need to include code to sign the requests. You might do this for the following reasons:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,You are working with a programming language for which there is no AWS SDK.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,You want complete control over how a request is sent to AWS.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You don't need to sign a request when you use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or one of the AWS SDKs. These tools manage the connection details, such as calculating signatures, handling request retries, and error handling. In most cases, they also contain sample code, tutorials, and other resources to help you get started writing applications that interact with AWS.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Why Requests Are Signed     
Amazon Lambda,The signing process helps secure requests in the following ways:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Verify the identity of the requester     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Signing makes sure that the request has been sent by someone with a valid access key. For more information, see Understanding and Getting Your Security Credentials.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Protect data in transit     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"To prevent tampering with a request while it's in transit, some of the request elements are used to calculate a hash (digest) of the request, and the resulting hash value is included as part of the request. When an AWS service receives the request, it uses the same information to calculate a hash and matches it against the hash value in your request. If the values don't match, AWS denies the request.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Protect against potential replay attacks     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"In most cases, a request must reach AWS within five minutes of the time stamp in the request. Otherwise, AWS denies the request.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Signing Requests     
Amazon Lambda,"To sign a request, you first calculate a hash (digest) of the request. Then you use the hash value, some other information from the request, and your secret access key to calculate another hash known as the signature. Then you add the signature to the request in one of the following ways:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Using the HTTP Authorization header.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Adding a query string value to the request. Because the signature is part of the URL in this case, this type of URL is called a presigned URL.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Signature Versions     
Amazon Lambda,"AWS supports two signature versions: Signature Version 4 and Signature Version 2. You should use Signature Version 4. All AWS services support Signature Version 4, except Amazon SimpleDB which requires Signature Version 2. For AWS services that support both versions, we recommend that you use Signature Version 4.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,All AWS regions support Signature Version 4.     
Amazon Lambda,Signature Version 2 Signing Process

Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Endpoint     
Amazon Lambda,"Also known as the host part of an HTTP request. This is the DNS name of the computer where you send the Query request. This is different for each AWS region. For the list of endpoints for each service, see AWS Regions and Endpoints.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Action     
Amazon Lambda,The action you want a web service to perform. This value determines the parameters used in the request.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,AWSAccessKeyId     
Amazon Lambda,A value distributed by AWS when you sign up for an AWS account.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,SignatureMethod     
Amazon Lambda,The hash-based protocol used to calculate the signature. This can be either HMAC-SHA1 or HMAC-SHA256 for Signature Version 2.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,SignatureVersion     
Amazon Lambda,The version of the AWS signature protocol.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Timestamp     
Amazon Lambda,The time at which you make the request. Include this in the Query request to help prevent third parties from intercepting your request.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Required and optional parameters     
Amazon Lambda,Each action has a set of required and optional parameters that define the API call.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Signature     
Amazon Lambda,The calculated value that ensures the signature is valid and has not been tampered.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The following is an example Amazon EMR Query request formatted as an HTTPS GET request.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The endpoint, elasticmapreduce.amazonaws.com, is the default endpoint and maps to the region us-east-1.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The action is DescribeJobFlows, which requests information about one or more job flows.     "

Amazon Lambda,How to Generate a Signature Version 2 for a Query Request     
Amazon Lambda,"Web service requests are sent across the Internet and are vulnerable to tampering. To check that the request has not been altered, AWS calculates the signature to determine if any of the parameters or parameter values were changed en route. AWS requires a signature as part of every request.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Be sure to URI encode the request. For example, blank spaces in your request should be encoded as %20. Although an unencoded space is normally allowed by the HTTP protocol specification, unencoded characters create an invalid signature in your Query request. Do not encode spaces as a plus sign (+) as this will cause errors.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The following topics describe the steps needed to calculate a signature using AWS Signature Version 2.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Task 1: Format the Query Request     
Amazon Lambda,"Before you can sign the Query request, format the request in a standardized (canonical) format. This is needed because the different ways to format a Query request will result in different HMAC signatures. Format the request in a canonical format before signing. This ensures your application and AWS will calculate the same signature for a request.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"To create the string to sign, you concatenate the Query request components. The following example generates the string to sign for the following call to the Amazon EMR API.     "

Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"In the preceding request, the last four parameters (AWSAccessKeyID through Timestamp) are called authentication parameters. They're required in every Signature Version 2 request. AWS uses them to identify who is sending the request and whether to grant the requested access.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,To create the string to sign (Signature Version 2)     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Start with the request method (either GET or POST), followed by a newline character. For human readability, the newline character is represented as \n.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,GET\n     
Amazon Lambda,"Add the HTTP host header (endpoint) in lowercase, followed by a newline character. The port information is omitted if it is the standard port for the protocol (port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS), but included if it is a nonstandard port.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,elasticmapreduce.amazonaws.com\n     
Amazon Lambda,"Add the URL-encoded version of each path segment of the URI, which is everything between the HTTP host header to the question mark character (?) that begins the query string parameters, followed by a newline character. Don't encode the forward slash (/) that delimits each path segment.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"In this example, if the absolute path is empty, use a forward slash (/).     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,/\n     
Amazon Lambda,"Add the query string components, as UTF-8 characters which are URL encoded (hexadecimal characters must be uppercase). You do not encode the initial question mark character (?) in the request. For more information, see RFC 3986.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Sort the query string components by byte order. Byte ordering is case sensitive. AWS sorts these components based on the raw bytes.     
Amazon Lambda,

Amazon Lambda,Signature Version 4 Signing Process     
Amazon Lambda,"Signature Version 4 is the process to add authentication information to AWS requests sent by HTTP. For security, most requests to AWS must be signed with an access key, which consists of an access key ID and secret access key. These two keys are commonly referred to as your security credentials. For details on how to obtain credentials for your account, see Understanding and Getting Your Security Credentials.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Important     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"When you use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or one of the AWS SDKs to make requests to AWS, these tools automatically sign the requests for you with the security credentials you specify when you configure the tools. When you use these tools, you don't need to learn how to sign requests yourself. However, when you manually create HTTP requests to access AWS services, you must sign requests that require signing yourself.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,How Signature Version 4 works     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Create a canonical request.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Use the canonical request and additional metadata to create a string for signing.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Derive a signing key from your AWS secret access key. Then use the signing key, and the string from the previous step, to create a signature.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Add the resulting signature to the HTTP request in a header or as a query string parameter.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"When an AWS service receives the request, it performs the same steps that you did to calculate the signature you sent in your request. AWS then compares its calculated signature to the one you sent with the request. If the signatures match, the request is processed. If the signatures don't match, the request is denied.     "

Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If you have questions about Signature Version 4, post your question in the AWS Identity and Access Management forum.     "
Amazon Lambda,Changes in Signature Version 4

Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"To sign your message, you use a signing key that is derived from your secret access key rather than using the secret access key itself. For more information about deriving keys, see Task 3: Calculate the Signature for AWS Signature Version 4.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You derive your signing key from the credential scope, which means that you don't need to include the key itself in the request. Credential scope is represented by a slash-separated string of dimensions in the following order:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Date information as an eight-digit string representing the year (YYYY), month (MM), and day (DD) of the request (for example, 20150830). For more information about handling dates, see Handling Dates in Signature Version 4.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Region information as a lowercase alphanumeric string. Use the region name that is part of the service's endpoint. For services with a globally unique endpoint such as IAM, use us-east-1.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Service name information as a lowercase alphanumeric string (for example, iam). Use the service name that is part of the service's endpoint. For example, the IAM endpoint is https://iam.amazonaws.com, so you use the string iam as part of the Credential parameter.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,A special termination string: aws4_request.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,You use the credential scope in each signing task:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If you add signing information to the query string, include the credential scope as part of the X-Amz-Credential parameter when you create the canonical request in Task 1: Create a Canonical Request for Signature Version 4.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,You must include the credential scope as part of your string to sign in Task 2: Create a String to Sign for Signature Version 4.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Finally, you use the date, region, and service name components of the credential scope to derive your signing key in Task 3: Calculate the Signature for AWS Signature Version 4.     "
Amazon Lambda,Elements of an AWS Signature Version 4 Request     
Amazon Lambda,Each HTTP/HTTPS request that uses version 4 signing must contain these elements.

Amazon Lambda,Authentication Parameters     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Endpoint Specification     
Amazon Lambda,"This is specified as the Host header in HTTP/1.1 requests. This header specifies the DNS name of the computer to which you send the request, like dynamodb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You must include the Host header with HTTP/1.1 requests. For HTTP/2 requests, you can use the :authority header or the Host header. Use only the :authority header for compliance with the HTTP/2 specification. Not all services support HTTP/2 requests, so check the service documentation for details.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The endpoint usually contains the service name and region, both of which you must use as part of the Credential authentication parameter. For example, the Amazon DynamoDB endpoint for the eu-west-1 region is dynamodb.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com. If you don't specify a region, a web service uses the default region, us-east-1. If you use a service like IAM that uses a globally unique endpoint, use the default region (us-east-1), as part of the Credential authentication parameter (described later in this topic).     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For a complete list of endpoints supported by AWS, see Regions and Endpoints.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Action     
Amazon Lambda,"This element specifies the action that you want a web service to perform, such as the DynamoDB CreateTable action or the Amazon EC2 DescribeInstances action. The specified action determines the parameters used in the request. For query APIs, the action is an API name. For non-query APIs (such as RESTful APIs), see the service documentation for the appropriate actions.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Required and Optional Parameters     
Amazon Lambda,This element specifies the parameters to the request action. Each action in a web service has a set of required and optional parameters that define an API call. The API version is usually a required parameter. See the service documentation for the details of required and optional parameters.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Date     
Amazon Lambda,This is the date and time at which you make the request. Including the date in the request helps prevent third parties from intercepting your request and resubmitting it later. The date is specified using the ISO8601 Basic format via the x-amz-date header in the YYYYMMDD'T'HHMMSS'Z' format.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Authentication Parameters     
Amazon Lambda,Each request that you send must include the following set of parameters that AWS uses to ensure the validity and authenticity of the request.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Algorithm. The hash algorithm that you're using as part of the signing process. For example, if you use SHA-256 to create hashes, use the value AWS4-HMAC-SHA256.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Credential scope. A string separated by slashes (""/"") that is formed by concatenating your access key ID and your credential scope components. Credential scope includes the date in YYYYMMDD format, the AWS region, the service name, and a special termination string (aws4_request).

Amazon Lambda,"To create a signed request, complete the following:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Task 1: Create a Canonical Request for Signature Version 4     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Arrange the contents of your request (host, action, headers, etc.) into a standard (canonical) format. The canonical request is one of the inputs used to create a string to sign.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Task 2: Create a String to Sign for Signature Version 4     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Create a string to sign with the canonical request and extra information such as the algorithm, request date, credential scope, and the digest (hash) of the canonical request.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Task 3: Calculate the Signature for AWS Signature Version 4     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Derive a signing key by performing a succession of keyed hash operations (HMAC operations) on the request date, region, and service, with your AWS secret access key as the key for the initial hashing operation. After you derive the signing key, you then calculate the signature by performing a keyed hash operation on the string to sign. Use the derived signing key as the hash key for this operation.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Task 4: Add the Signature to the HTTP Request     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"After you calculate the signature, add it to an HTTP header or to the query string of the request.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The AWS SDKs handle the signature calculation process for you, so you do not have to manually complete the signing process. For more information, see Tools for Amazon Web Services.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Additional Signing Resources     
Amazon Lambda,The following additional resources illustrate aspects of the signing process:

Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Examples of the Complete Version 4 Signing Process (Python). This set of programs in Python provide complete examples of the signing process. The examples show signing with a POST request, with a GET request that has signing information in a request header, and with a GET request that has signing information in the query string.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Signature Version 4 Test Suite. This downloadable package contains a collection of examples that include signature information for various steps in the signing process. You can use these examples to verify that your signing code is producing the correct results at each step of the process.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,What Signing Looks Like in a Request     
Amazon Lambda,"The following example shows what an HTTPS request might look like as it is sent from your client to AWS, without any signing information.     "

Amazon Lambda,X-Amz-Date: 20150830T123600Z     
Amazon Lambda,"After you complete the signing tasks, you add the authentication information to the request. You can add the authentication information in two ways:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Authorization header     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You can add the authentication information to the request with an Authorization header. Although the HTTP header is named Authorization, the signing information is actually used for authentication to establish who the request came from.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The Authorization header includes the following information:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Algorithm you used for signing (AWS4-HMAC-SHA256)     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Credential scope (with your access key ID)

Amazon Lambda,GET and POST Requests in the Query API     
Amazon Lambda,"The query API that many AWS services support lets you make requests using either HTTP GET or POST. (In the query API, you can use GET even if you're making requests that change state; that is, the query API is not inherently RESTful.) Because GET requests pass parameters on the query string, they are limited to the maximum length of a URL. If a request includes a large payload (for example, you might upload a large IAM policy or send many parameters in JSON format for a DynamoDB request), you generally use a POST request.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The signing process is the same for both types of requests.     
Amazon Lambda,Task 1: Create a Canonical Request for Signature Version 4     
Amazon Lambda,"To begin the signing process, create a string that includes information from your request in a standardized (canonical) format. This ensures that when AWS receives the request, it can calculate the same signature that you calculated.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Follow the steps here to create a canonical version of the request. Otherwise, your version and the version calculated by AWS won't match, and the request will be denied.     "

Each input byte must be represented as exactly two hexadecimal characters.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Signature Version 4 does not require that you use a particular character encoding to encode the canonical request. However, some AWS services might require a specific encoding. For more information, consult the documentation for that service.     "

"
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Normalize URI paths according to RFC 3986. Remove redundant and relative path components. Each path segment must be URI-encoded twice (except for Amazon S3 which only gets URI-encoded once).

Amazon Lambda,URI-encode each parameter name and value according to the following rules:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Do not URI-encode any of the unreserved characters that RFC 3986 defines: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, hyphen ( - ), underscore ( _ ), period ( . ), and tilde ( ~ ).     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Percent-encode all other characters with %XY, where X and Y are hexadecimal characters (0-9 and uppercase A-F). For example, the space character must be encoded as %20 (not using '+', as some encoding schemes do) and extended UTF-8 characters must be in the form %XY%ZA%BC.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Build the canonical query string by starting with the first parameter name in the sorted list.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For each parameter, append the URI-encoded parameter name, followed by the equals sign character (=), followed by the URI-encoded parameter value. Use an empty string for parameters that have no value.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Append the ampersand character (&) after each parameter value, except for the last value in the list.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"One option for the query API is to put all request parameters in the query string. For example, you can do this for Amazon S3 to create a presigned URL. In that case, the canonical query string must include not only parameters for the request, but also the parameters used as part of the signing process—the hashing algorithm, credential scope, date, and signed headers parameters.     "
Amazon Lambda,

Amazon Lambda,"For more information about how to derive a signing key in different programming languages, see Examples of How to Derive a Signing Key for Signature Version 4.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Calculate the signature. To do this, use the signing key that you derived and the string to sign as inputs to the keyed hash function. After you calculate the signature, convert the binary value to a hexadecimal representation.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The following pseudocode shows how to calculate the signature.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"signature = HexEncode(HMAC(derived signing key, string to sign))     "
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Make sure you specify the HMAC parameters in the correct order for the programming language you are using. This example shows the key as the first parameter and the data (message) as the second parameter, but the function that you use might specify the key and data in a different order.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The following example shows the resulting signature if you use the same signing key and the string to sign from Task 2:

Amazon Lambda,Task 4: Add the Signature to the HTTP Request     
Amazon Lambda,"After you calculate the signature, add it to the request. You can add the signature to a request in one of two ways:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,An HTTP header named Authorization     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The query string     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,You cannot pass signing information in both the Authorization header and the query string.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You can use temporary security credentials provided by the AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) to sign a request. The process is the same as using long-term credentials, but requires an additional HTTP header or query string parameter for the security token. The name of the header or query string parameter is X-Amz-Security-Token, and the value is the session token (the string you received from AWS STS when you obtained temporary security credentials).     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"When you add the X-Amz-Security-Token parameter to the query string, some services require that you include this parameter in the canonical (signed) request. For other services, you add this parameter at the end, after you calculate the signature. For details, see the API reference documentation for that service.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Adding Signing Information to the Authorization Header     
Amazon Lambda,"You can include signing information by adding it to an HTTP header named Authorization. The contents of the header are created after you calculate the signature as described in the preceding steps, so the Authorization header is not included in the list of signed headers. Although the header is named Authorization, the signing information is actually used for authentication.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The following pseudocode shows the construction of the Authorization header.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Authorization: algorithm Credential=access key ID/credential scope, SignedHeaders=SignedHeaders, Signature=signature     "
Amazon Lambda,The following example shows a finished Authorization header.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Authorization: AWS4-HMAC-SHA256 Credential=AKIDEXAMPLE/20150830/us-east-1/iam/aws4_request, SignedHeaders=content-type;host;x-amz-date, Signature=5d672d79c15b13162d9279b0855cfba6789a8edb4c82c400e06b5924a6f2b5d7     "
Amazon Lambda,Note the following:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"There is no comma between the algorithm and Credential. However, the SignedHeaders and Signature are separated from the preceding values with a comma.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The Credential value starts with the access key ID, which is followed by a forward slash (/), which is followed by the credential scope that you calculated in Task 2: Create a String to Sign for Signature Version 4. The secret access key is used to derive the signing key for the signature, but is not included in the signing information sent in the request.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Adding Signing Information to the Query String     
Amazon Lambda,"You can make requests and pass all request values in the query string, including signing information. This is sometimes referred to as a presigned URL, because it produces a single URL with everything required in order to make a successful call to AWS. It's commonly used in Amazon S3. For more information, see Authenticating Requests by Using Query Parameters (AWS Signature Version 4) in the Amazon Simple Storage Service API Reference.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Important     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If you make a request in which all parameters are included in the query string, the resulting URL represents an AWS action that is already authenticated. Therefore, treat the resulting URL with as much caution as you would treat your actual credentials. We recommend you specify a short expiration time for the request with the X-Amz-Expires parameter.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"When you use this approach, all the query string values (except the signature) are included in the canonical query string that is part of the canonical query that you construct in the first part of the signing process.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The following pseudocode shows the construction of a query string that contains all request parameters.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,querystring = Action=action     
Amazon Lambda,querystring += &X-Amz-Algorithm=algorithm     
Amazon Lambda,querystring += &X-Amz-Credential= urlencode(access_key_ID + '/' + credential_scope)     
Amazon Lambda,querystring += &X-Amz-Date=date     
Amazon Lambda,querystring += &X-Amz-Expires=timeout interval     
Amazon Lambda,querystring += &X-Amz-SignedHeaders=signed_headers     
Amazon Lambda,"After the signature is calculated (which uses the other query string values as part of the calculation), you add the signature to the query string as the X-Amz-Signature parameter:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,querystring += &X-Amz-Signature=signature      
Amazon Lambda,The following example shows what a request might look like when all the request parameters and the signing information are included in query string parameters.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,https://iam.amazonaws.com?Action=ListUsers&Version=2010-05-08&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIDEXAMPLE%2F20150830%2Fus-east-1%2Fiam%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20150830T123600Z&X-Amz-Expires=60&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=content-type%3Bhost&X-Amz-Signature=37ac2f4fde00b0ac9bd9eadeb459b1bbee224158d66e7ae5fcadb70b2d181d02     
Amazon Lambda,Note the following:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For the signature calculation, query string parameters must be sorted in code point order from low to high, and their values must be URI-encoded. See the step about creating a canonical query string in Task 1: Create a Canonical Request for Signature Version 4.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Set the timeout interval (X-Amz-Expires) to the minimal viable time for the operation you're requesting.     
Amazon Lambda,Handling Dates in Signature Version 4     
Amazon Lambda,"The date that you use as part of your credential scope must match the date of your request. You can include the date as part of your request in several ways. You can use a date header, an x-amz-date header or include x-amz-date as a query parameter. For example requests, see Examples of the Complete Version 4 Signing Process (Python).     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The time stamp must be in UTC and in the following ISO 8601 format: YYYYMMDD'T'HHMMSS'Z'. For example, 20150830T123600Z is a valid time stamp. Do not include milliseconds in the time stamp.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"AWS first checks the x-amz-date header or parameter for a time stamp. If AWS can't find a value for x-amz-date, it looks for the date header. AWS then checks the credential scope for an eight-digit string representing the year (YYYY), month (MM), and day (DD) of the request. For example, if the x-amz-date header value is 20111015T080000Z and the date component of the credential scope is 20111015, AWS allows the authentication process to proceed.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If the dates don't match, AWS rejects the request, even if the time stamp is only seconds away from the date in the credential scope. For example, AWS will reject a request that has an x-amz-date header value of 20151014T235959Z and a credential scope that has the date 20151015.     "
Amazon Lambda,Examples of How to Derive a Signing Key for Signature Version 4     
Amazon Lambda,"This page shows examples in several programming languages for how to derive a signing key for Signature Version 4. The examples on this page show only how to derive a signing key, which is just one part of signing AWS requests. For examples that show the complete process, see Examples of the Complete Version 4 Signing Process (Python).     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If you are using one of the AWS SDKs (including the SDK for Java, .NET, Python, Ruby, or JavaScript), you do not have to manually perform the steps of deriving a signing key and adding authentication information to a request. The SDKs perform this work for you. You need to manually sign requests only if you are directly making HTTP or HTTPS requests.     "

Amazon Lambda,"To simplify your task, avoid the following common coding errors.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Tip     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Examine the HTTP request that you're sending to AWS with a tool that shows you what your raw HTTP requests look like. This can help you spot issues that aren't evident from your code.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Don't include an extra newline character, or forget one where it's required.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Don't format the date incorrectly in the credential scope, such as using a time stamp instead of YYYYMMDD format.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Make sure the headers in the canonical headers and the signed headers are the same.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Don't inadvertently swap the key and the data (message) when calculating intermediary keys. The result of the previous step's computation is the key, not the data. Check the documentation for your cryptographic primitives carefully to ensure that you place the parameters in the proper order.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Don't forget to add the string ""AWS4"" in front of the key for the first step. If you implement the key derivation using a for loop or iterator, don't forget to special-case the first iteration so that it includes the ""AWS4"" string.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For more information about possible errors, see Troubleshooting AWS Signature Version 4 Errors.     "
Amazon Lambda,Examples of the Complete Version 4 Signing Process (Python)     
Amazon Lambda,This section shows example programs written in Python that illustrate how to work with Signature Version 4 in AWS. We deliberately wrote these example programs to be simple (to use few Python-specific features) to make it easier to understand the overall process of signing AWS requests.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If you are using one of the AWS SDKs (including the SDK for C++, SDK for Go, SDK for Java, AWS SDK for JavaScript, AWS SDK for .NET, SDK for PHP, SDK for Python (Boto 3), or SDK for Ruby), you do not have to manually perform the steps of deriving a signing key and adding authentication information to a request. The SDKs perform this work for you. You need to manually sign requests only if you are directly making HTTP or HTTPS requests.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"In order to work with these example programs, you need the following:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Python 2.x installed on your computer, which you can get from the Python site. These programs were tested using Python 2.7 and 3.6.     "
Amazon Lambda,

Amazon Lambda,Paths in ARNs     
Amazon Lambda,"Some services let you specify a path for the resource name. For example, in Amazon S3, the resource identifier is an object name that can include slashes (/) to form a path. Similarly, IAM user names and group names can include paths.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"In some circumstances, paths can include a wildcard character, namely an asterisk (*). For example, if you are writing an IAM policy and in the Resource element you want to specify all IAM users that have the path product_1234, you can use a wildcard like this:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Development/product_1234/*     
Amazon Lambda,"Similarly, in the Resource element of an IAM policy, at the end of the ARN you can specify user/* to mean all users or group/* to mean all groups, as in the following examples:     "

Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For example, if you want to download a specific file from an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket, your credentials must allow that access. If your credentials aren't authorized to download the file, AWS denies your request.     "

Amazon Lambda,AWS Account Root User Credentials vs. IAM User Credentials     
Amazon Lambda,"All AWS accounts have root user credentials (that is, the credentials of the account owner). These credentials allow full access to all resources in the account. You cannot use policies within your account to explicitly deny access to the root user. You can only use an AWS Organizations service control policy (SCP) to limit permissions to an account, including the root user, that is a member of an organization or organizational unit (OU). Because of this, we recommend that you delete your root user access keys and then create AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user credentials for everyday interaction with AWS. For more information, see Lock away your AWS account (root) access keys in the IAM User Guide.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You may need AWS account root user access for specific tasks, such as changing an AWS support plan or closing your account. In these cases, sign in to the AWS Management Console with your email and password. See Email and Password (Root User).     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For a list of tasks that require root user access, see AWS Tasks That Require AWS Account Root User Credentials.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"With IAM, you can securely control access to AWS services and resources for users in your AWS account. For example, if you require administrator-level permissions, you can create an IAM user, grant that user full access, and then use those credentials to interact with AWS. If you need to modify or revoke your permissions, you can delete or modify the policies that are associated with that IAM user.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If you have multiple users that require access to your AWS account, you can create unique credentials for each user and define who has access to which resources. You don't need to share credentials. For example, you can create IAM users with read-only access to resources in your AWS account and distribute those credentials to your users.     "
Amazon Lambda,

Amazon Lambda,"The tasks listed below require you to sign in as the AWS account root user. We normally recommend that you use a standard IAM user with appropriate permissions to perform all normal user or administrative tasks. However, you can perform the tasks listed below only when you sign in as the root user of an account.     "

Amazon Lambda,Understanding and Getting Your Security Credentials     
Amazon Lambda,"You use different types of security credentials depending on how you interact with AWS. For example, you use a user name and password to sign in to the AWS Management Console. You use access keys to make programmatic calls to AWS API operations or to use AWS CLI commands.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If you forget or lose your credentials, you can't recover them. For security reasons, AWS doesn't allow you to retrieve your passwords or secret access keys and does not store the private keys that are part of a key pair. However, you can create new credentials and then disable or delete the old credentials.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note

Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Important     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"We strongly recommend that you do not use the root user for your everyday tasks, even the administrative ones. Instead, adhere to the best practice of using the root user only to create your first IAM user. Then securely lock away the root user credentials and use them to perform only a few account and service management tasks. To view the tasks that require you to sign in as the root user, see AWS Tasks That Require Root User.     "
Amazon Lambda,

Amazon Lambda,"If you previously signed in to the console with IAM user credentials, your browser might remember this preference and open your account-specific sign-in page. You cannot use the IAM user sign-in page to sign in with your AWS account root user credentials. If you see the IAM user sign-in page, choose Sign-in using root user credentials near the bottom of the page to return to the main sign-in page. From there, you can enter your AWS account email address and password.     "
Amazon Lambda,

Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,IAM User Name and Password     
Amazon Lambda,"Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to create unique user identities in AWS. IAM users provide their user names and passwords when they sign in to the AWS Management Console, AWS discussion forums, or AWS Support center. In some cases, an IAM user name and password are required to use a service, such as sending email with SMTP by using Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES).     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For more information about IAM users, see Identities (Users, Groups, and Roles) in the IAM User Guide.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You specify user names when you create them. Optionally, you can create passwords for each user. For more information, see Managing Passwords for IAM Users in the IAM User Guide.     "

Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"IAM users can manage their own password but only if they have been given permission. For more information, see Permitting IAM Users to Change Their Own Password in the IAM User Guide.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)     
Amazon Lambda,"Multi-factor authentication (MFA) provides an extra level of security that you can apply to your AWS account. For additional security, we recommend that you require MFA on the AWS account root user credentials and highly privileged IAM users. For more information, see Using Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) in AWS in the IAM User Guide.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"With MFA enabled, when you sign in to the AWS website, you are prompted for your user name and password, and an authentication code from an MFA device. Together, they provide increased security for your AWS account settings and resources.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"By default, MFA (multi-factor authentication) is not enabled. You can enable and manage MFA devices for the AWS account root user by going to the Security Credentials page or the IAM dashboard in the AWS Management Console. For more information about enabling MFA for IAM users, see Enabling MFA Devices in the IAM User Guide.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Access Keys (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key)     
Amazon Lambda,"Access keys consist of two parts: an access key ID (for example, AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE) and a secret access key (for example, wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY). You use access keys to sign programmatic requests that you make to AWS if you use AWS CLI commands (using the SDKs) or using AWS API operations. For more information, see Signing AWS API Requests. Like a user name and password, you must use both the access key ID and secret access key together to authenticate your requests. Manage your access keys as securely as you do your user name and password.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"When you create access keys, you create the access key ID and secret access key as a set. During access key creation, AWS gives you one opportunity to view and download the secret access key part of the access key. If you don't download it or if you lose it, you can delete the access key and then create a new one. You can create IAM user access keys with the IAM console, AWS CLI, or AWS API. For more information, see Managing Access Keys for IAM Users in the IAM User Guide. To create access keys for your AWS account root user, you must use the AWS Management Console. For more information, see Managing Access Keys for Your AWS Account Root User in the IAM User Guide. We strongly recommend that you do not use the root user for your everyday tasks, even the administrative ones. Instead, adhere to the best practice of using the root user only to create your first IAM user. Then securely lock away the root user credentials and use them to perform only a few account and service management tasks. To view the tasks that require you to sign in as the root user, see AWS Tasks That Require Root User.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Important     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Do not provide your access keys to a third party, even to help find your canonical user ID. By doing this, you might give someone full access to your account.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"A newly created access key has the status of active, which means that you can use the access key for CLI and API calls. You are limited to two access keys for each IAM user, which is useful when you want to rotate the access keys. You can also assign up to two access keys to the root user. When you disable an access key, you can't use it for API calls, and inactive keys do count toward your limit. You can create or delete an access key any time. However, when you delete an access key, it's gone forever and can't be retrieved.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You can also create and use temporary access keys, known as temporary security credentials. In addition to the access key ID and secret access key, temporary security credentials include a security token that you must send to AWS when you use temporary security credentials. The advantage of temporary security credentials is that they are short term. After they expire, they're no longer valid. You can use temporary access keys in less secure environments or distribute them to grant users temporary access to resources in your AWS account. For example, you can grant entities from other AWS accounts access to resources in your AWS account (cross-account access). You can also grant users who don't have AWS security credentials access to resources in your AWS account (federation). For more information, see Temporary Security Credentials in the IAM User Guide. For information on the unique IDs that IAM creates, including their prefixes (like the AKIA used in AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE, above), see IAM Identifiers in the IAM User Guide.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Key Pairs     
Amazon Lambda,"Key pairs are unrelated to access keys, and consist of a public key and a private key. You use the private key to create a digital signature, and then AWS uses the corresponding public key to validate the signature. Key pairs are used only for Amazon EC2 and Amazon CloudFront.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For Amazon EC2, you use key pairs to access Amazon EC2 instances, such as when you use SSH to log in to a Linux instance. For more information, see Connect to Your Linux Instances in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For Amazon CloudFront, you use key pairs to create signed URLs for private content, such as when you want to distribute restricted content that someone paid for. For more information, see Serving Private Content through CloudFront in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"AWS does not provide key pairs for your account; you must create them. You can create Amazon EC2 key pairs from the Amazon EC2 console, CLI, or API. For more information, see Amazon EC2 Key Pairs in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You create Amazon CloudFront key pairs from the Security Credentials page. Only the AWS account root user (not IAM users) can create CloudFront key pairs. For more information, see Serving Private Content through CloudFront in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.     "
Amazon Lambda,AWS Account Identifiers     
Amazon Lambda,AWS assigns two unique IDs to each AWS account:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,An AWS account ID     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,A canonical user ID     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The AWS account ID is a 12-digit number, such as 123456789012, that you use to construct Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). When you refer to resources, such as an IAM user or an Glacier vault, the account ID distinguishes your resources from resources in other AWS accounts.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The canonical user ID is a long string, such as 79a59df900b949e55d96a1e698fbacedfd6e09d98eacf8f8d5218e7cd47ef2be.     "

Amazon Lambda,"You can use canonical user IDs in an Amazon S3 bucket policy for cross-account access, which means an AWS account can access resources in another AWS account. For example, to grant another AWS account access to your bucket, you specify the account's canonical user ID in the bucket's policy. For more information, see Bucket Policy Examples in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.     "

Amazon Lambda,Best Practices for Managing AWS Access Keys     
Amazon Lambda,"When you access AWS programmatically, you use an access key to verify your identity and the identity of your applications. An access key consists of an access key ID (something like AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE) and a secret access key (something like wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY).     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Anyone who has your access key has the same level of access to your AWS resources that you do. Consequently, AWS goes to significant lengths to protect your access keys, and, in keeping with our shared-responsibility model, you should as well.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The steps that follow can help you protect access keys. For general background, see AWS Security Credentials.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Your organization may have different security requirements and policies than those described in this topic. The suggestions provided here are intended to be general guidelines.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Remove (or Don't Generate) Account Access Key     
Amazon Lambda,"An access key is required in order to sign requests that you make using the AWS Command Line Tools, the AWS SDKs, or direct API calls. Anyone who has the access key for your AWS account root user has unrestricted access to all the resources in your account, including billing information. You cannot restrict the permissions for your AWS account root user.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"One of the best ways to protect your account is to not have an access key for your AWS account root user. Unless you must have a root user access key (which is very rare), it is best not to generate one. Instead, the recommended best practice is to create one or more AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users, give them the necessary permissions, and use IAM users for everyday interaction with AWS.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If you already have an access key for your account, we recommend the following: Find places in your applications where you are currently using that key (if any), replace the root user access key with an IAM user access key, and then disable and remove the root user access key. For details about how to substitute one access key for another, see the post How to Rotate Access Keys for IAM Users on the AWS Security Blog.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"By default, AWS does not generate an access key for new accounts.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For information about how to create an IAM user with administrative permissions, see Creating Your First IAM Admin User and Group in the IAM User Guide.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Use Temporary Security Credentials (IAM Roles) Instead of Long-Term Access Keys     
Amazon Lambda,"In many scenarios, you don't need a long-term access key that never expires (as you have with an IAM user). Instead, you can create IAM roles and generate temporary security credentials. Temporary security credentials consist of an access key ID and a secret access key, but they also include a security token that indicates when the credentials expire.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Long-term access keys, such as those associated with IAM users and AWS account root users, remain valid until you manually revoke them. However, temporary security credentials obtained through IAM roles and other features of the AWS Security Token Service expire after a short period of time. Use temporary security credentials to help reduce your risk in case credentials are accidentally exposed.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Use an IAM role and temporary security credentials in these scenarios:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You have an application or AWS CLI scripts running on an Amazon EC2 instance. Do not pass an access key to the application, embed it in the application, or have the application read a key from a source such as an Amazon S3 bucket (even if the bucket is encrypted). Instead, define an IAM role that has appropriate permissions for your application and launch the Amazon EC2 instance with roles for EC2. This associates an IAM role with the Amazon EC2 instance and lets the application get temporary security credentials that it can in turn use to make AWS calls. The AWS SDKs and the AWS CLI can get temporary credentials from the role automatically.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You need to grant cross-account access. Use an IAM role to establish trust between accounts, and then grant users in one account limited permissions to access the trusted account. For more information, see Tutorial: Delegate Access Across AWS Accounts Using IAM Roles in the IAM User Guide.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You have a mobile app. Do not embed an access key with the app, even in encrypted storage. Instead, use Amazon Cognito to manage user identity in your app. This service lets you authenticate users using Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any OpenID Connect (OIDC)–compatible identity provider. You can then use the Amazon Cognito credentials provider to manage credentials that your app uses to make requests to AWS. For more information, see Using the Amazon Cognito Credentials Provider on the AWS Mobile Blog.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You want to federate into AWS and your organization supports SAML 2.0. If you work for an organization that has an identity provider that supports SAML 2.0, configure the provider to use SAML to exchange authentication information with AWS and get back a set of temporary security credentials. For more information, see About SAML 2.0-based Federation in the IAM User Guide.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You want to federate into AWS and your organization has an on-premises identity store. If users can authenticate inside your organization, you can write an application that can issue them temporary security credentials for access to AWS resources. For more information, see Creating a URL that Enables Federated Users to Access the AWS Management Console (Custom Federation Broker) in the IAM User Guide.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Manage IAM User Access Keys Properly     
Amazon Lambda,"If you do need to create access keys for programmatic access to AWS, create an IAM user and grant that user only the permissions he or she needs. Then generate an access key for that user. For details, see Managing Access Keys for IAM Users in the IAM User Guide.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Remember that if you are running an application on an Amazon EC2 instance and the application needs access to AWS resources, you should use IAM roles for EC2, as described in the previous section.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Observe these precautions when using access keys:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Don't embed access keys directly into code. The AWS SDKs and the AWS Command Line Tools allow you to put access keys in known locations so that you do not have to keep them in code.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Put access keys in one of the following locations:     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The AWS credentials file. The AWS SDKs and AWS CLI automatically use the credentials that you store in the AWS credentials file.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For information about using the AWS credentials file, see the documentation for your SDK. Examples include Set up AWS Credentials and Region for Development in the AWS SDK for Java Developer Guide and Configuration and Credential Files in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Note     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"To store credentials for the AWS SDK for .NET and the AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell, we recommend that you use the SDK Store. For more information, see Using the SDK Store in the AWS SDK for .NET Developer Guide.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Environment variables. On a multitenant system, choose user environment variables, not system environment variables.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"For more information about using environment variables to store credentials, see Environment Variables in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Use different access keys for different applications. Do this so that you can isolate the permissions and revoke the access keys for individual applications if an access key is exposed. Having separate access keys for different applications also generates distinct entries in AWS CloudTrail log files, which makes it easier for you to determine which application performed specific actions.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Rotate access keys periodically. Change access keys on a regular basis. For details, see Rotating Access Keys (AWS CLI, Tools for Windows PowerShell, and AWS API) in the IAM User Guide and How to Rotate Access Keys for IAM Users on the AWS Security Blog.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Remove unused access keys. If a user leaves your organization, remove the corresponding IAM user so that the user's access to your resources is removed. To find out when an access key was last used, use the GetAccessKeyLastUsed API (AWS CLI command: aws iam get-access-key-last-used).     "

Amazon Lambda,Managing Access Keys for Your AWS Account Root User     
Amazon Lambda,"We strongly recommend that you do not use the AWS account root user for your everyday tasks, even the administrative ones. Instead, adhere to the best practice of using the root user only to create your first IAM user. Then securely lock away the root user credentials and use them to perform only a few account and service management tasks. To view the tasks that require you to sign in as the root user, see AWS Tasks That Require Root User.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You can create, rotate, disable, or delete access keys (access key IDs and secret access keys) for your AWS account root user. Anyone who has root user access keys for your AWS account has unrestricted access to all the resources in your account, including billing information.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"When you create access keys, you create the access key ID and secret access key as a set. During access key creation, AWS gives you one opportunity to view and download the secret access key part of the access key. If you don't download it or if you lose it, you can delete the access key and then create a new one. You can create IAM user access keys with the IAM console, AWS CLI, or AWS API. For more information, see Managing Access Keys for IAM Users in the IAM User Guide. To create access keys for your AWS account root user, you must use the AWS Management Console.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"A newly created access key has the status of active, which means that you can use the access key for CLI and API calls. You are limited to two access keys for each IAM user, which is useful when you want to rotate the access keys. You can also assign up to two access keys to the root user. When you disable an access key, you can't use it for API calls, and inactive keys do count toward your limit. You can create or delete an access key any time. However, when you delete an access key, it's gone forever and can't be retrieved.     "

Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Review the policies attached to the groups the user is in. See Tips for Reviewing IAM Policies.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Delete security credentials that the user doesn't need or that might have been exposed. For example, an IAM user that is used for an application does not need a password (which is necessary only to sign in to AWS websites). Similarly, if a user does not use access keys, there's no reason for the user to have one. For more information, see Managing Passwords for IAM Users and Managing Access Keys for IAM Users in the IAM User Guide.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"You can generate and download a credential report that lists all IAM users in your account and the status of their various credentials, including passwords, access keys, and MFA devices.

Amazon Lambda,Tips for Reviewing IAM Policies     
Amazon Lambda,"Policies are powerful and subtle, so it's important to study and understand the permissions that are granted by each policy. Use the following guidelines when reviewing policies:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"As a best practice, attach policies to groups instead of to individual users. If an individual user has a policy, make sure you understand why that user needs the policy.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Make sure that IAM users, groups, and roles have only the permissions that they need.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Use the IAM Policy Simulator to test policies that are attached to users or groups.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Remember that a user's permissions are the result of all applicable policies—user policies, group policies, and resource-based policies (on Amazon S3 buckets, Amazon SQS queues, Amazon SNS topics, and AWS KMS keys). It's important to examine all the policies that apply to a user and to understand the complete set of permissions granted to an individual user.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Be aware that allowing a user to create an IAM user, group, role, or policy and attach a policy to the principal entity is effectively granting that user all permissions to all resources in your account. That is, users who are allowed to create policies and attach them to a user, group, or role can grant themselves any permissions. In general, do not grant IAM permissions to users or roles whom you do not trust with full access to the resources in your account.

Amazon Lambda,"Closely examine any values for the Action or Resource element that include *. It's a best practice to grant Allow access to only the individual actions and resources that users need. However, the following are reasons that it might be suitable to use * in a policy:     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,The policy is designed to grant administrative-level privileges.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The wildcard character is used for a set of similar actions (for example, Describe*) as a convenience, and you are comfortable with the complete list of actions that are referenced in this way.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"The wildcard character is used to indicate a class of resources or a resource path (e.g., arn:aws:iam::account-id:users/division_abc/*), and you are comfortable granting access to all of the resources in that class or path.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"A service action does not support resource-level permissions, and the only choice for a resource is *.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Examine policy names to make sure they reflect the policy's function. For example, although a policy might have a name that includes ""read only,"" the policy might actually grant write or change permissions.     "

Amazon Lambda,AWS Regions and Endpoints     
Amazon Lambda,"To reduce data latency in your applications, most Amazon Web Services offer a Regional endpoint to make your requests. An endpoint is a URL that is the entry point for a web service. For example, https://dynamodb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com is an entry point for the Amazon DynamoDB service.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Some services, such as IAM, do not support Regions; therefore, their endpoints do not include a Region. Some services, such as Amazon EC2, let you specify an endpoint that does not include a specific Region, for example, https://ec2.amazonaws.com. In that case, AWS routes the endpoint to us-east-1.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"If a service supports Regions, the resources in each Region are independent. For example, if you create an Amazon EC2 instance or an Amazon SQS queue in one Region, the instance or queue is independent from instances or queues in another Region.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"When you begin using AWS, many Regions are enabled by default. You can begin working in these Regions immediately. AWS provides some additional Regions that you must manually enable before you can use those Regions. One such Region is the Asia Pacific (Hong Kong) Region. To learn more about enabling and disabling AWS Regions, see Managing AWS Regions.     "

Amazon Lambda,"By default, the AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) is available as a global service, and all STS requests go to a single endpoint at https://sts.amazonaws.com.

You can deactivate STS endpoints for any Regions that are enabled by default if you do not intend to use those Regions.     "

Amazon Lambda,Managing AWS Regions     
Amazon Lambda,You can use the AWS Management Console to enable and disable some AWS Regions. This allows you to control whether users in your AWS account can access resources in that Region. You can enable and disable Regions only if they are not enabled by default.     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,Enabling a Region     
Amazon Lambda,"To enable a Region, you must be an administrator for the account with permissions to enable Regions. To view an example policy that includes these permissions, see AWS: Allows Enabling and Disabling AWS Regions in the IAM User Guide.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"When you enable a Region, AWS performs actions to prepare your account in that Region, such as distributing your IAM resources to the Region. This process takes a few minutes for most accounts, but this can take several hours. You cannot use the Region until this process is complete.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,To enable a Region     
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"Sign in to the AWS Management Console using administrative credentials with a policy that allows enabling Regions. To view an example policy that provides these permissions, see AWS: Allows Enabling and Disabling AWS Regions in the IAM User Guide.     "
Amazon Lambda,     
Amazon Lambda,"In the upper right corner of the console, choose your account name or number and then choose My Account.     "
Amazon Lambda,

After you disable a Region, you can no longer view or manage resources in that Region. However, resources in that Region can continue to incur charges. For more information, see Enabling and Disabling Regions in the AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide.     "
