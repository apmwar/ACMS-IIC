37483,Amazon EC2 V1,"My paid AMI cannot be launched I have an application that allows customers to launch a paid AMI of mine, however it has stopped working. That is, an error is thrown when a machine is attempted to launch.  Specifically, it is: Amazon.EC2.AmazonEC2Exception: Internal Error ---> System.Net.WebException: The remote server returned an error: (400) Bad Request.    at System.Net.HttpWebRequest.GetResponse()    at Amazon.EC2.AmazonEC2Client.Invoke[T](IDictionary`2 parameters, ImmutableCredentials credentials)    --- End of inner exception stack trace ---    at Amazon.EC2.AmazonEC2Client.Invoke[T](IDictionary`2 parameters, ImmutableCredentials credentials)    at Amazon.EC2.AmazonEC2Client.Invoke[T](IDictionary`2 parameters)    at <the method that normally invokes the launching of an instance>  I added in some debugging messages of my own and found that it seems to be losing it at this part of my code: RunInstancesResponse response = service.RunInstances(request); Â                  RunningInstance runningInstance = response.RunInstancesResult.Reservation.RunningInstance[0];                 return new EC2Instance(runningInstance.InstanceId, runningInstance.PublicDnsName);  Previously (last year), with the AWSSDK .NET version 1.3.2 it was working fine for about a year. I recently (last month) re-compiled with 1.4.3 and it was also working fine.  Today I tried to use the latest version I made and I am getting the above error. I un-installed my newest version of my app(from AWSSDK 1.4.3) from my dev machine and re-installed the older version(1.3.2), and the same error occurs.  Is this a temporary glitch on the servers? or has something just recently changed?  Thanks.  EDIT: I just tried it with the latest version of the AWSSDK, 1.4.7 and it is still not working."

37483,Amazon EC2 V1,Hello  I have not been able reproduce any problems with the RunInstances operation.  Could you share the code that creates the request object?
37483,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi, Norm. After a ton of trial-and-error, I think I found the problem. My application was pulling the AMI ID from a file (so I could keep the server updated in  a manner where I don't need to hard-code the ID) and I found that it included some white space at the end of it. To confirm, I grabbed the sample here: http://aws.amazon.com/code/734 and after logging in, I tried to launch one of my machines by it's AMI ID and included a space or two at the end and, indeed, it gave the error: 400 Bad Request. So I corrected for this in my code and it now works.  Again though, this worked previously just fine with (my mistaken) white spaces, so am I correct to believe that something was changed on Amazon's end?  Meanwhile, during my trials, I un-subscribed to my product and then re-subscribed. Now when I try to launch one of my paid AMIs, (from the AWS console) I get a message that says: ""Subscription to ProductCode 1B437231 required.""...although my account says I am subscribed. Can anyone check into that?  Thanks again, Michael"
37482,Amazon EC2 V1,"How do I create a 'instance store' typed instance, from a Windows VHD? I have a Windows VHD image created in Hyper-V, and I want it to exist as a S3-backed instance on EC2, not EBS.  I've found several articles (and a tutorial) on how to import my virtual machine to EC2; for instance: http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/UploadingYourInstancesandVolumes.html. However, I can't find any instructions on how to use the imported VM to create a S3-backed instance. The link I pointed to above explains how to import a volume into EBS but neglects to discuss S3.   Can anyone point me to (or supply) instructions for creating a EC2 instance, from a Windows VHD, that has a root device type of 'instance store'?"
37482,Amazon EC2 V1,"I'm not certain you can, for a couple of reasons.  1. The import tools create ebs backed instances, you need to use a bundle process to create instance store instances.  2. With instance store instances, root volume size is limited to 10GB, which eliminates windows 2008 as an option. Windows 2003 is the only version of windows that can be used as instance store."

37480,Amazon EC2 V1,"Instance store backed AMIs - how to increase root volume? I am trying to put together an instance store backed AMI (eventually for use with DevPay, hence the need to be instance store instead of EBS).  Amazon's Linux AMI starting points have an 8GB root volume.  This turns out to be just a tad smaller than I need, so I would like to get up to the full 10GB instance store maximum.

37469,Amazon EC2 V1,Does ec2 instance ip address ever change on dhcp lease renewal? We have noticed on our ec2 instances that IP addresses seem to be renewed via dhcp about twice per day. We have never seen an IP address change on renewal.   Is it possible for the IP address of a running ec2 instance to change on dhcp renewal?
37469,Amazon EC2 V1,"I have never seen this myself or heard about it. While it is technically possible, AWS might have implemented it in a way such that it can't happen. AWS might want to jump in to clarify this.  However, you will want to assume that it can change at any time. There are a number of scenarios where this can occur. If something happens to that instance, you will get a new IP address. Stopping/starting is one example, which you might be forced to do if the underlying host becomes degraded.   If you rely on having a static endpoint, you might want to use Elastic IP addresses. You don't need the external Elastic IP address itself, but there is a little trick you can use. In case you aren't aware of this already, the Elastic IP DNS name resolves to the current private IP address when used within the same EC2 region."
37469,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hello  D. Svanlund is correct, from our user guide ( http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html )   ""This private address is associated exclusively with the instance for its lifetime and is only returned to Amazon EC2 when the instance is stopped or terminated.""  Kind Regards AndyC"
37469,Amazon EC2 V1,Thanks for the documentation reference. This answers my question perfectly.
37469,Amazon EC2 V1,"just to be sure: Will the local ip lease never expire if the instance stays online for let's say a year and only on restart/stop/terminate?  Because, i read here http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2012/01/ec2-instance-status-checks.html about 'failed to renew its DHCP lease'."
37469,Amazon EC2 V1,"If you rely on the private IP address I would recommend looking into VPC. It gives you full control over private IP address assignments. Unexpected things can always happen to your instance. If all you need is a static endpoint, the Elastic IP approach might be an option."
37468,Amazon EC2 V1,"A ""Pause"" button for each instance in the Elastic Load Balancer? Hi,   I'm using the ELB. I have configured it so it makes the health check every 6 seconds (as frequent as possible). Lets say that in a certain instance that belongs to the ELB I need to turn off Apache or MySQL. If I do, in the worst case the load balancer will still redirect requests to that instance, until the next health check is performed and the ELB detects that the instance is not healthy. Those request will fail, and the website visitor will see an error message.   Why don't you guys place a ""Pause"" button next to each instance in the ELB, so we can pause it when we know it won't be able to serve requests? Removing that instance (and adding it again) is too much hassle in those cases.  By the way, in the current list of instances that belong to an ELB, there used to be a column with the instance name. It is gone now. Why?"
37468,Amazon EC2 V1,"If you need to take the instance out of service for a limited time, you can make it fail the health checks. When you return anything other than a 200 OK response, the instance will eventually be considered unhealthy. Until that happens, you can continue to serve all other requests as usual. When you are done, let the health checks succeed again."
37468,Amazon EC2 V1,"I'm confussed. Please tell me which of these sentences is right:   When I stop Apache, and until the next health check is performed, the ELB doesn't know that the instance is not healthy yet, and can continue sending requests to it. When It does, those request will not work and an error response will arrive to the client (an exception, for example).    When I stop Apache, even though the next health check is XX seconds away in the future, the next time the ELB redirects a client's request to this server, the ELB will notice that the server could not deliver, so the ELB will send that request to one of the other instances, so no request will ever fail."
37468,Amazon EC2 V1,"If you stop Apache just like that, the instance can receive requests until it is determined to be unhealthy. However, if you voluntarily fail the health check, it will be taken out of service as gracefully as possible. When you created the load balancer, you specified a health check URL. If you wish to take the instance out, have this URL return an error response code instead. Other requests will still be handled as usual until the ELB decides that your instance is in fact unhealthy. At that point, you can take down Apache. The health check trick is just a way to minimize the interruption. In case it is easier for you to simply remove the instance, do that instead."
37468,Amazon EC2 V1,"Excuse me, but I'm still confused. Which of my two sentences (in my original email) is right?  I still don't understand: If I turn off Apache, or MySQL, or any other services needed for a succesful response, what will happen in the next seconds before the next healt check? Lets say that Apache is off because I had to stop it: Will the ELB wait several seconds until it receives a time out, and in the mean time make the client wait? Or will the ELB notice something is not right, even thought the next health check hasn't been arrived yet? What if I turn off MySQL instead and java gets an exception and returns an error trace to the browser: Will the ELB notice the request didn't work? If so, will it try the request again with another server?  In any case, why wouldn't you place a ""Pause"" option for the instances that have been enrolled with the ELB? It would be convenient, the ELB would know that the server should not be asked to do the task."
37468,Amazon EC2 V1,"The ELB will not do anything with the response. You can consider it to be pretty ""dumb"". If your Java code throws an exception, that will simply be passed to the client. Assuming the health check requests still succeed, anyone served by that instance will be presented with that error. The health check status determines whether an instance remains in service. The first statement is (almost) correct. If the instance doesn't respond at all, it is possible that requests won't be served for a brief period.  As for the ""pause"" functionality, that sounds like a feature request for AWS to consider. I'll leave that question for an AWS representative. However, I believe you can achieve the desired result by removing the instance from the load balancer, or fail the health check."
37468,Amazon EC2 V1,"Now I understand it. In fact, maybe my first sentence is a little bit dumb. How can the ELB know that something is wrong if I turn off Apache, or I'm just uploading a new version of my app, or MySQL is down, etc? There are too many failure symtoms the ELB can experiment, so as to be able to know exactly when the instance should not be considered healthy or not. Unless the health check were performed before any request, which would be to costly. OK, I can not turn off the services just like that.  Programming my site to fail the check voluntarily would be an option, but I would have to program that feature. And I would have to find a way to send that message to any of the instances specifically. Not a very, very easy task.   I think it would be easier to have the pause button. And I think it would be easy for your team to implement it. And it would be far easier than taking out an instance off the ELB, and taking it in back again!  I hope you guys will consider it."
37468,Amazon EC2 V1,"Thanks for the feature request -- we will take it under consideration.  The one thing that I am a little unclear on is what the difference is between a pause and de-registering and registering the instance.  For example, if you are updating the instance directly, you could have a simple script that de-registers it and then registers it as part of the update.  It would work something like this (using the command line tools):  elb-deregister-instances-from-lb {MyLoadBalancer} --instances i-xxxxx  {do work}  elb-register-instances-with-lb {MyLoadBalancer} --instances i-xxxxx  In the AWS Console, next to the list of instances is a red/green +/- sign, which lets you remove and add instances, effectively the same as using the CLI commands above.  I assume in your suggestion of a pause button, you are thinking it would have the same effect, but the load balancer would still be aware of the existence of the instance, just not sending traffic to it until the switch was flipped back to ""on""."
37468,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi Specer,  I'm not using the command tools, I'm only using the web management console. It is not that I'm not skilled enough to use the command tools, it is just that I haven't installed them because so far I have been able to do everything I need, using the web console. I guess most of the users have only used the web console as well. I must say registering and de-registering the instances with a command IS a cool idea, it could take just one click of an icon in my windows desktop once I installed the tools and create the batches with the commands. But as I said, I think most of the users dont use the command tools.  In the web console it is very easy to remote the instance from the ELB, I just press the red minus, you are right. But registering it again is not so immediate, I need to wait until the next dialog loads (and by the way, that dialog sometimes takes several seconds to fill the checkboxes of the included instances, with no visual indication that it is still about to check them), and then to search for the instance and select it. It would be nice to just pause an instance, instead of de-registering and registering it again. As you have said, the ELB would still be aware of the instance and it wouldn't be un-registered, but it would just not send traffic to that instance until the pause switch is again in the ""on"" position. I would really be a nice feature, and I bet it is easy for you to program it. It is just a new attribute for an instance (paused, boolean), a new button that inverts this boolean value, and a change to the logic of the ELB so it checks the value of this attribute when it evaluates if requests should be sent to the instance.   By the way, in the screen that shows the instances registered in an ELB, it used to show the name of the instance, and now it doesn't! Why did you take that value of the table? It is harder now to evaluate the list of instances."
37468,Amazon EC2 V1,"Regarding the display of the instance name, I've passed that on so we can see when we can get that done.  I agree it would be helpful to show that."
37468,Amazon EC2 V1,"Yes, please, tell them to restore that. It didn't make sense to remote it. If we define a name tag, we definitely wan't to see it in that page."
37467,Amazon EC2 V1,"cannot connect to ec2 instance I'm just getting started with using the Amazon cloud, and I have been trying to connect to a linux high-cpu server and have been unable to do so.   Iâve created instances several times and the instances appear to start up ok. If I retrieve the log file, it goes all the way to a login prompt.  Iâve done this a number of times, but the instances that I know that I have tried are AMI medium (5 cpu) and redhat both 5 cpu and 20 cpu.  I get a variety of different errors when I try to connect, and I apologize, because I havenât kept complete track of which error goes with each instance and connect method that Iâve tried.  Iâve tried with both the java ssh and using putty. With java, when I click the connect button, I donât get any apparent response and it just stays on the same screen with an apparent broken link image file on the bottom.  I tried putty since Iâm used to using that to connect to our own linux servers. When I had problems, I downloaded the latest version of putty just in case, but that didnât change the result at all.  Iâve gotten a number of different errors, including an immediate network error. Or sometimes a window opens, but then gives an network error. Or, in the case of redhat, I got to the login prompt, but after I entered the login ec2-user, the window just disappeared.  In one case (and I donât remember which instance I was using), I got a message like âno supported authentication methodâ, although I donât know if Iâve got the exact wording correct.

37466,Amazon EC2 V1,"Question regarding elastic load balancer and connection management. Hi !  We are using AWS ELB to front end traffic from all our clients. I had a quick question w.r.t how the ELB manages connections between the ELB itself and the application servers behind it. Does the ELB initiate a new connection for every connection from the client to the back end servers. For example, if I have 1000 clients connection to my application, does the ELB create a 1000 connections from it to my back end servers? Or can the ELB configured to use a pool of connections between it and the back end servers? Would appreciate thoughts on this.  Regards, Venkatesh"
37466,Amazon EC2 V1,"Not aware of a feature like this for ELB directly but take Apache httpd for example - you can set your thread pool thresholds for each server directly ... check out the Apache MPM worker documentation at http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/worker.html.  That said, it would probably provide some efficiencies if the Amazon ELB in itself kept some connections direct to your backend servers warm instead of tearing down and rebuilding each time.  Would imagine they have something like this built but that would be a guess."
37466,Amazon EC2 V1,"If you are using an HTTP listener to the back-end instance, ELB will re-use connections.  You should also enable keep-alives on your back-end instance so that ELB can keep the connection open for re-use.  The keep-alive should be more than 60 seconds, since that is the idle timeout for the connection from ELB to your instance."

We've setup a pingdom check that executes an HTTP request against the same host and, too, noticed that about 0.7% of requests either complete with 10x latency or timeout (take over 10 seconds to process).   Our server load is nominal and internal logs do not mention the above timed-out requests.

37464,Amazon EC2 V1,"How would you scale this? Hello,   I just got started with EC2 and have a question regarding scaling.  I have a m1.small EBS instance running LAMP and one Elastic IP. This instance hosts my 4 websites, all of which are WordPress blogs using MySQL on the same instance. Everything is working well so far.  Now I'm expecting a major traffic influx in the next couple of weeks and I wanna be prepared for this. What would be the best strategy to ensure that my instance can handle a traffic flood?  Would it be better to increase the size of the existing instance (e.g. from small to large) or to launch multiple additional instances? When using multiple instances how can I make sure they all use the same database?   Thanks for your answers!"
37464,Amazon EC2 V1,"If the sites you are expecting a traffic spike in the next weeks are Wordpress, I'd consider enabling the use of Cloudfront CDN. You can install the W3TotalCache Wordpress plugin, configure caching for generated pages with acceptable expiration dates, enable minification and compression of js and css, and add CloudFront as CDN.  You can also push ahead this configuration by enabling the S3 hosting of images and other assets (js, css). This is also managed by the W3TotalCache plugin.  IMHO this is a simpler setup than replicating the entire instance (you'd have to configure and manage also the mysql replication).  This configuration will let you speed up your site even if you don't have a lot of traffic and mitigate spikes' impact even when you're not aware of them."
37464,Amazon EC2 V1,"That's a great idea, thanks for the suggestion.

Is this something built in as a security feature that I can change? I'm using Amazon Linux. It appears the remote server has been down a few hours which is rare.
37453,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi,  I don't believe Amazon Linux blocks ports automatically. Filtering traffic to EC2 instances can be achieved through security groups. Have you looked at system logs for the instance from the management console?   Regards, Preethi"

37451,Amazon EC2 V1,EC2 and RDP stopped working all of sudden EC2 instance: ec2-46-51-185-106.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com  RDP screen doesn't come up even though it seems to be communicating with the server (the security credentials popup is still happening).

37451,Amazon EC2 V1,My instance is now flagged as unreachable by AWS in the console.
37451,Amazon EC2 V1,OK .. I completely stopped the instance (as opposed to restart). Reassociated the elastic IP and now we're back to normal. Very Odd.

37449,Amazon EC2 V1,"What is the difference between reservered instances & on-demand instances? What is the difference between reservered instances & on-demand instances? I see there is quite a price difference, reserved instances being considerably cheaper.  Thanks in advance."
37449,Amazon EC2 V1,"When you make a certain commitment, AWS is able to give you a much better price. You pay an upfront fee and can then enjoy the lower hourly rate during the entire term. There are no technical differences. Nothing happens to the instances you might be running already. The system simply compares the reservations to your running instances. When a match is found, the reserved instance rate is applied.  For more information, see Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances."
37449,Amazon EC2 V1,"Thanks. I read the FAQ on this, but it didn't supply the answrs I am looking for.  So if I have this right, operationally, there is no difference. The only difference is that reserved is like a subscription, with discount? Meaning, if I agree to pay monthly for two years, for example, I get a discount? And then Amazon charge me every month regardless?  But then how does it then work with scaling, if I go from, say medium to large for a few months, or what happens if I shut the instance down etc?   Cheers  Edited by: aspero210 on Apr 19, 2012 5:50 AM"
37449,Amazon EC2 V1,"There are three different types of reservations. With a Light or Medium reservation, you can terminate the instance at any time to avoid further charges. The one time fee is non-refundable though. A Heavy reservation will be charged for the entire term. In that case, the full number of hours are added to your bill each month, no matter if you have an instance running or not.  You can purchase any reservation type. If you are planning to use the instance for the entire term, Heavy is your best bet. But keep in mind that Medium could be a better choice in case you aren't entirely sure. It simply depends on how well you can predict your needs. An instance reservation covers a specific instance type, platform, and availability zone. If you decide to go with a different instance type later, the reservation won't work with the new one."
37449,Amazon EC2 V1,"Ok, now it makes sense. Thanks!"

They are 32bit Amazon Linux instances. I know how to stop them as Micro instances and then start them as a small instances. But I am unsure if there is now swap space available on the small instance:  Running free on the micro instance shows this: [root@dev ~]# free              total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached Mem:        617044     610256       6788          0      38252     173372 -/+ buffers/cache:     398632     218412 Swap:            0          0          0   Running free on the small instance shows this: [root@all ~]# free              total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached Mem:       1718096     406788    1311308          0      11764     157440 -/+ buffers/cache:     237584    1480512 Swap:       917500          0     917500   Does this mean that the small instance has the swap space available but just isn't using it as there is enough physical memory available?  Is there anything I should do to ensure it is available to use when required?  Thanks  Nick"
37430,Amazon EC2 V1,"Swap space generally only gets used when you run out of physical memory. While it can help your instance handle a spike, running into swap will slow things down quite a bit."
37430,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi D. Johansson,  Thanks for the explanation of swap space. I thought that might be the case, it's not so much I want to us it a lot but more want it to be available. Your explanation though doesn't really confirm it what I am seeing is some correctly configure swap space?  Thanks  Nick"
37430,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi,  I would be interested to get the answer too. I'm running into the exact same problem here.  Thanks"
37429,Amazon EC2 V1,"Security Group as connection source I have in a single Amazon account a set of servers belonging to the same Security Group. Some the servers are dedicated Memcached servers. The other servers need to be able to connect to the Memcached servers, essentially open TCP connections to port 11211.I want to configure the Security Group so that only our own servers, i.e. all the servers in this Amazon account and in this Security Group can connect to port 11211 on the Memcached servers. Itâs OK for me if connections to other servers to port 11211 are allowed too, thereâs nobody listening to those ports. Our environment has a dynamic nature, we add and remove servers quiteÂ  often. Because of this I donât want to manually grant access to port 11211 to each source IP (each server). In the management console, in the Security Groups configuration I see that the column that used to be called IP is currently called âSource (IP or group)â. I have troubles finding the documentation on this âgroupâ feature. For example, I have now the following connections in the Security Group:Â Â  Â Connection method: AllÂ Â  Â Protocol: tcpÂ Â  Â From Port: 1 Â Â  Â To Port: 65535Â Â  Â Source: XXX groupÂ Â  Â Connection method: AllÂ Â  Â Protocol: icmpÂ Â  Â From Port: -1Â Â  Â To Port:Â  -1Â Â  Â Source: XXX groupWhere XXX group is the name of my Security Group. I donât remember adding these rules. I see these (and a corresponding one for UDP) in the default security group too, so it seems these have been automatically added.What are the semantics of these configuration?Historically, Iâve been allowing connections from 10.0.0.0/8, but thatâs insecure. I need to remove that, but I donât know if the above TCP/11211 rule with the security group as a source works for me. I donât want to try removing the 10.0.0.0/8 rule, because the application is live."
37429,Amazon EC2 V1,"You're on the right track. Sounds like you want two security groups:  memcached_client: empty, no rules  memcached_server: allow TCP from memcached_client  Your memcached servers should belong to the memcached_server group, and any machine you want to be able to talk to the memcached servers should belong to the memcached_client group."
37429,Amazon EC2 V1,To make this simpler. I have the following rule in Security Group XXX Â Â Â  Connection method: AllÂ Â  Â Protocol: tcpÂ Â  Â From Port: 1 Â Â  Â To Port: 65535Â Â  Â Source: XXX groupDoes this mean that all members of XXX can connect to any TCP port on any member of the XXX group?
37429,Amazon EC2 V1,"Yes it can connect from port 1-65535. Another good example is from Amazon docs:----------This example grants TCP port 80 access from the source group called OtherAccountGroup(in AWS account 999988887777) to your websrv security group.PROMPT> <span class=""command"">ec2-authorize</span> websrv -P tcp -p 80 -u 999988887777 -o OtherAccountGroup----But seems you can only do this on command line..and not from AWS console not sure."

For more information on this, see my post to the AWS blog:http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2010/06/building-three-tier-architectures-with-security-groups.htmlIt uses a traditional three-tier architecture as a model, but the same principle applies here. My post also describes why you see different behavior at the console than with the APIs."
37429,Amazon EC2 V1,"I'm trying to do the same thing I believe.  I have 2 security groups, one is 'default' and the other is 'frontend'.  My MySQL DB belong to the 'default' group and the Apache web front ends belong to the 'frontend' group.  I tried to add TCP 3306 with a source of sg-xxxxxxx (frontend).  However this doesn't seem to allow them to connect.  When I open the source up to 0.0.0.0/0, this works.  What am I doing wrong?  Also, something weird is that we don't have a VPC, but the only way to find my security groups other than the 'default' is to go to the VPC tab and then select EC2 Groups.  Thanks  Joshua"

37428,Amazon EC2 V1,"You'll need to read more here at the AWS/EC2 site, but I think I can help.  You can configure a single server, and make it exactly as you need it.  Then, you can ""clone"" it is many times as you like.  (You create an AMI from the instance you like, then launch new instance from that AMI.)  EC2 offers ""security groups"" that act much like a firewall, allowing only traffic on selected ports and optionally only from selected IP ranges, using CIDR notation.  The VPC offering allows even more flexibility, allowing things like a DMZ, subnets, etc.  There is a lot of flexibility when considering all the offerings here at EC2 and from AWS in general, so keep reading, search the forums for questions that have likely been asked already, keep posting questions.  At one point, just launch an instance and play around.  You pay as you go, and it costs very little to get started, and you can stop and trash it all any time you want.  James"

37420,Amazon EC2 V1,"UBUNTU AMI's ACTION NEEDED:  Update AMI's cloud-init or take manual action -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA1  Hello,  As mentioned earlier 1,2, and in an effort to improve on reliability of the Ubuntu archive mirrors for EC2 instances, Canonical is replacing the existing EC2 archive mirrors with mirrors backed by Amazon S3. This change itself will be done via modification of DNS entries and will be transparent to users.  However, due to a bug in the http pipelining implementation in S3 [3], a change to apt configuration needs to be made to avoid download errors. We have chosen to deliver this change via a package upgrade in cloud-init.  The action required is one of the following: a.) upgrade cloud-init:     $ sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get install -y cloud-init b.) launch official AMIâs released after 2012-04-01, which will     have the fix included. Please see http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/release for the latest AMIâs.     Additionally, the Amazon EC2 Quickstart has been updated with     the latest AMIâs. At this time we are still in the process of     updating AMIs for Ubuntu 8.04 LTS and Ubuntu 10.10[4].     Announcements will be sent out when they are available. c.) manually disable http pipeline use in apt     $ echo 'Acquire::http::Pipeline-Depth ""0"";' |       sudo tee /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99-no-pipelining  Should you choose not to take appropriate action, you will likely experience transient apt downloading errors after the change is implemented. In order to give appropriate time to apply the change, this transition will not occur before April 18, 2012.   For users of Ubuntu 8.04 LTS AMIs, you will need to take options 'b' or 'c'. There is not a package update deliverable fix at this time. For Ubuntu 10.10, the update will be released on its end-of-life, which is April 10th, 2012.

37419,Amazon EC2 V1,"ELB with multiple pools Hi,  Is it possible for ELB to have multiple pools associated with each listen port?  For example:  Pool A: listen-port: 80 server1: 10.0.0.10:81 server2: 10.0.0.11:81  Pool B: listen-port: 8001 server1: 10.0.1.10:8002 server2: 10.0.1.11:8002  I need this to be behind one ELB as I want to CNAME www.example.com to the ELB A record. Our code is such that it uses www.example.com:80 for the main web page and www.example.com:8001 for other things.   Thanks"
37419,Amazon EC2 V1,"Unfortunately, the ELB can only have a single set of backend instances. All instances need to be able to handle incoming requests on any configured port. It sounds like you might need to add an additional layer behind the ELB. That would allow you to send the requests to different servers for processing. Multiple ELBs can be an option as well, but that will obviously make it quite hard to set up a single subdomain."
37419,Amazon EC2 V1,"I thought I understood your question, then I looked at your example again.  You show the same servers, (server1 and server2), though traffic is routed to different ports on those servers depending on the port accessed at the ELB.  If the set of servers in the ""pool"" is the same for your main web site AND for your other stuff, then ELB would work for you.  You can forward port 80 traffic to port 81 on any ""pool"" instances, AND forward port 8001 to port 8002 on those same ""pool"" instances.  (You probably already knew that... but, just in case something got lost in the words.)  James"

37412,Amazon EC2 V1,"I've seen this too, and strace shows that the timeout is from the proxy trying to resolve http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/  It's not clear to me why it's insisting on querying this outside of EC2, but it is.  That request isn't coming from within curl, so it's no surprise that setting NO_PROXY=169.254.169.254 does not work.  However, setting no_proxy=169.254.169.254 does (correctly) cause the request to bypass the proxy. (Unfortunately, that doesn't work for me either, probably because that address is valid within my institution.)  Setting no_proxy=169.254.169.254 might work for you, though, depending on what happens when you try to access that address directly..."
37412,Amazon EC2 V1,"My successful workaround was to configure 169.254.169.254 as a local address on my machine, and set no_proxy=169.254.169.254  To keep this local to my machine, I set it up as a local bridge device. To do that, I created a file /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-virbr1 containing:DEVICE=virbr1 TYPE=Bridge IPADDR=169.254.169.254 NETMASK=255.255.255.0 ONBOOT=yes  Another solution would be a firewall rule (also with the no_proxy environment variable set)."

37408,Amazon EC2 V1,"2E or Not 2E [EC2-Elastic]... I need some serious help here, because our host has become increasingly unreliable, as we are migrating to a new server, where we need redundancy and a new disaster recovery plan.   With our large client-base, we can't afford to lose a minute of uptime anymore! We have 150+ clients on a virtual host environment, running WHM and cpanel, (since our ""lead developer"" works another full time job, and I can't ssh myself out of a cardboard box).  Right now, we're running (2) Xeon Quad Core 2.13GHz Nehalem with 1TB of storage each, running Enterprise Linux / CentOS 64bit, with an average of 450GB of data transfer per month. We currently use 5 IP addresses, but we would probably want to reserve about 20-30 of them, as we intend to provide SSL for individual clients here and there.  I'm trying to figure out the following:  Amazon EC2 Questions... 1. Do I need 2-3 separate instances, or can I just get by with 1 instance that has 2-3 *elastic load balancers*? 2.Â What are +Elastic IP Remaps+? 3. If I set up additional IP addresses, and don't use them, will I be paying for +Elastic IP Non-attached Time+? 4. Would someone like me benefit from having a Cluster, or should I just do (2-3) High CPU Extra Large Instances? 5.Â Should I set up an S3 to serve all static content? Or just attach additional volumes to the EC2 as needed? 6.Â Should I reserve this/these instance(s)? (I understand this could be good for consistent costs?)  Extra Credit... 7.Â Is there an easy way to create a virtualhost environment similar to the one I'm running now using WHM/Cpanel? 8.Â Should I just install WHM/Cpanel on the server(s), or should I just grow up and learn how to do everything via command-line? (some of the features are rigid, but the UI is easy for someone like me to understand until we get a full time lead developer)  Speaking of which... 9.Â Do you need a job as a full time lead developer, and do you have experience with mobile software development? (just thought I'd throw it out there!   If anyone has any advice, it would be greatly appreciated! Our company is bursting at the seams right now, and these are just some of the (good) growing pains we're experiencing..."
37408,Amazon EC2 V1,"develope wrote: 1. Do I need 2-3 separate instances, or can I just get by with 1 instance that has 2-3 *elastic load balancers*?  While a single really powerful instance might work, it won't be a good choice when considering availability and scalability. I'm not sure if this is the time to redesign your entire setup, but AWS does provide a wide variety of services which might be useful. Unless this is something you wish to look into, I'll leave that discussion for later. When you have some time to spare, the AWS Architecture Center offers some interesting reference architectures, whitepapers and recorded webinars.  How do you plan on using the ELBs? The load balancer accepts incoming requests and will distribute them randomly across the available backend instances (= your servers). This can be useful if you have 2+ instances with the same configuration. What does your setup look like right now? You mentioned that there are two servers. Are they serving different clients?  Note that each EC2 instance can have a single public IP address only at this time. In order to host SSL-enabled websites, you would need to find a workaround, such as using a certificate covering multiple domains, or use ELBs to terminate the SSL traffic.  2.Â What are +Elastic IP Remaps+?  When you allocate an Elastic IP address, it can be used with any instance in your account. If you decide to move it from instance X to instance Y, or need to map it again to the same instance, that is one remap. If you stop an instance, the Elastic IP address (if any) will be disassociated. It can then be attached again when starting the instance. The stop/start functionality is kind of like turning off/on your computer.  3. If I set up additional IP addresses, and don't use them, will I be paying for +Elastic IP Non-attached Time+?  Yes, you will be charged for any unused Elastic IP addresses. However, if you don't intend to use these IP addresses, there is probably no need to allocate them in the first place. You can allocate up to five IP addresses by default, but it is possible to request a higher limit.  4. Would someone like me benefit from having a Cluster, or should I just do (2-3) High CPU Extra Large Instances?  A cluster instance basically works like any other instance type. It simply happens to have a very generous amount of capacity and super fast local network connectivity. But it is still a single instance running on a single underlying host.  5.Â Should I set up an S3 to serve all static content? Or just attach additional volumes to the EC2 as needed?  That would be a good idea in the long run, but right now it sounds like you will have enough work to do considering you might be moving to a new hosting provider.  6.Â Should I reserve this/these instance(s)? (I understand this could be good for consistent costs?)  At some point, you might think ""This instance works great and I will definitely use it for at least 1 year"". That is when you will want to purchase a reservation. When you make a certain commitment, AWS is able to give you a better price. Note that a reservation applies to a specific instance type, platform, and availability zone. If you purchase a reservation for say a Small instance, you won't be able to take the reservation with you in case you decide to upgrade (or downgrade).  7.Â Is there an easy way to create a virtualhost environment similar to the one I'm running now using WHM/Cpanel?  When you launch a new instance, you get to select an AMI, which stands for ""Amazon Machine Image"". It contains the base operating system and any other software. There are a lot of different images available from third parties as well, but in the end you get a server which needs to be managed by you. It is not that much different compared to your current hosting environment.  8.Â Should I just install WHM/Cpanel on the server(s), or should I just grow up and learn how to do everything via command-line? (some of the features are rigid, but the UI is easy for someone like me to understand until we get a full time lead developer)  As you are somewhat familiar with this software, it sounds like a good choice. See the previous question as well.  9.Â Do you need a job as a full time lead developer, and do you have experience with mobile software development? (just thought I'd throw it out there!   Full-time mobile application developer, not looking for a job   Hope it helps! You will probably have a lot more questions. Keep them coming. The community as well as AWS representatives are here to help!"

37396,Amazon EC2 V1,"ayushi,  Please see this forum post which explains why the Auto Scaling Policy is executing more than once while the alarm stays in the ALARM state.  Changing your Policy to use an AdjustmentType of ""ExactCapacity"" may solve your issue.  However it appears you want instances to be replaced whenever ELB considers it unhealthy.  Auto Scaling's health-check functionality will already do this without having to set up Alarms or Policies.  Simply specify ""ELB"" as the health-check type for the Auto Scaling Group using the UpdateAutoScalingGroup API.  https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=208713  Let us know if you have further questions, -Eric@AWS"

My requirement is not to replace the instance but to launch a new instance because we would like to take the backup of logs from the unhealthy instance and then terminate it. I tried using ExactCapacity, but no new instance was launched when the alarm was raised. I have just changed the adjustment type to ExactCapacity. I used describeScalingActivities, there was no scaling activity in Progress. Is there any thing i could have done wrong.  Can you please explain the difference between ExactCapacity and ChangeInCapacity as i could not find that in any documentation. Please  reply asap.

Because once the trial period ends, I want him to no longer to use my (test)software.  Is it possible to prevent to create a AMI (EBS) or a snapshot from a shared image?  I allready have prevented the root access of the user, but that do not fix my problem.  http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AESDG-chapter-sharingamis.html"

37394,Amazon EC2 V1,how long it takes for your instance to boot up and start to process requests ?  If it takes longer than evaluation interval you've set in alarm - then your instance is considered unhealthy and is automatically terminated.  You may also want to increase a cooldown period in your scale-up policy.

37392,Amazon EC2 V1,"micro vs small cpu cost-effectiveness I've seen the amazon docs on the appropriate use of micro instances, but one thing I cannot find is the effective ecu of the micro when it is throttled to ""background level"".  It seems that since a micro is 2 cents/hr while a small is 8 cents/hr it would be more cost effective to use 4 micros instead of a small if it can get above 1/4 ecu at background levels.  My application is cpu-bound (all cpus pegged to 100% for several days, little to no use of other resources) and I'm wondering which setup would work out cheaper."
37392,Amazon EC2 V1,"You might want to review the Micro Instance Concepts in case you haven't already done so. Sounds like you are aware of this though. Unfortunately, the micro instance type works best when you have a low background level usage. It is not designed to support constant CPU usage. That will get you throttled fast and won't result in a very good experience. It will become more or less unusable.  Edited by: D. Svanlund on Apr 17, 2012 11:12 PM"
37392,Amazon EC2 V1,"After re-reading the http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts_micro_instances.html link posted by D. Svanlund, it seems that t1.micro is not for you.  In fact, anything other than t1.micro seems better.  If you are CPU bound, perhaps you could event try a much larger ""extra large"" and see how it performed; perhaps ""a few hours"" of a very large instance would ultimately be more cost-effective than ""days"" of a a ""small"" instance.  (I don't understand the nature of your project or the workload, of course, so my suggestions are mostly fictions.)  AWS is cool because is it pay-as-you-go, and folks have done very clever applications that launch/terminate instances to accommodate varying workloads.  James"
37392,Amazon EC2 V1,I tried a high cpu medium instance and its performance was about the same as the 20 micros I had used before. This seems to support the theory that each micro has about 1/4 ecu at background levels.  the high-cpu instances do seem to be better value for cpu-bound tasks.
37391,Amazon EC2 V1,"Instance stuck in stopping state despite using force stop. Instance i-3ba9727c in us-west-1 will not stop despite issuing multiple forced stops.   I'm not sure whether it is best to wait for Amazon to remedy this problem or to try and force disassociation of the EBS volumes, snapshot root volume, register as an AMI and boot.   That's a hassle and past experience makes me think that trying to force the EBS volume to disassociate will probably hang too.  Can anyone advise?"
37391,Amazon EC2 V1,"The instance finally stopped.  But had this been a critical system where I didn't have the luxury to wait, I'm still curious what is the most effective/recommended method for working around this stalled stopping problem.  Can I count on being able to snapshot the EBS root volume so I can create a new AMI from that, as well as being able to force detach any other EBS volumes, when an instance is stuck in the stopping state?  Or will I run into a stall there too?"
37391,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hello.  We always recommend to use an architecture that is robust to failure, we try to predict and prevent any issue with the hardware under the instances but problems could happen at any time without a warning, what you could do is to have consistent snapshots of the EBS volumes and with this you could generate a new instance and detach any EIP that you have an connect it to the new instance.   Other option that you have is to use multiple EBS volumes, 1 for your OS, 1 for your data, and create an AMI of the OS EBS every time that you change anything in it, and EBS snapshots of your data every X amount of hours (depending of your application), if something happens with one instance, you could deploy a new one with that AMI and attach the EBS snapshot.   Of course, this are only 2 suggestions, you could have multiple solutions depending of your application (if it is a web server, you could use autoscaling with ELB, you could use RDS for databases, SES instead of outgoing mail servers for example), we cannot comment into what could be the best solution because we do not know your application and dependencies   Regards Jimmy"
37391,Amazon EC2 V1,"Thanks, Jimmy.  I much appreciate the reply.  I did partition this particular development system with a root EBS volume and a data EBS volume.  Our production systems are designed to be completely replaceable so are much more resilient to failure as you describe.  In the case of this development server, however, I'm still unclear whether I can always count on being able to detach an EBS volume from an instance that refuses to stop like I experienced tonight.  It somewhat sounded like you were implying that the detach is reliable for non-root EBS volumes, but not for root EBS volumes?"

I've already have dedicated server, but I want to migrate to EC2.  My server parameters: 2 x 8 Cores x 2,3GHz, 32 GB RAM, 1 TB SATA  My question is, what instance should I buy? O course I don't want to loose efficiency.  Thank you in advence!"
37389,Amazon EC2 V1,"The good news is that you are not locked-in by your initial decision.  Choose some 64-bit instance type, say ""extra large"", then launch an AMI of your choosing, Linux, Ubuntu, Windows, etc.  You will want to create your large EBS volume, mount it and format a file system.  Then, install and configure, etc.  Perhaps use an Elastic IP address so your ""A"" record has something stable to refer to.  Once you are up and running, if that instance seems like overkill, you can stop it and re-launch it as, say, a ""large"".  If it proves too weak, stop it and re-launch it as an even larger instance type.  You have quite a bit of flexibility before you would need to ""scale out"" across multiple servers.  These are just some quick words, but just remember you are not locked-in based on your initial choice, other than say 32-bit or 64-bit; you cannot re-launch a 32-bit instance as a 64-bit, and vice-versa.  James"
37389,Amazon EC2 V1,"In case you haven't found the instance type specifications, they are available on the Amazon EC2 Instance Types page. Start by looking at the available memory. That eliminates many instance types right away. The CPU capacity is a bit harder. Except for the cluster instances, it is measured as EC2 compute units. One compute unit roughly equals a 1.0-1.2 GHz 2007 Opteron or 2007 Xeon processor. For storage, you can use EBS. When you use an EBS image, you usually get a quite small root volume, but you can add additional volumes as needed.  As James already mentioned, you can take the different instance types for a spin. When you have found the optimal instance type, an instance reservation can help you lower the bill."

37373,Amazon EC2 V1,"Can I fake a ""system shutdown"" of a Spot Instance, to check it restarts ok Hi,  I've set up a long-running Spot Instance and want to check it restarts ok, and does some once-only setup stuff at the restart, after AWS forces it to close due to resource shortage or whatever reason.  I can see various manual methods but would like to be sure what really corresponds best to the same scenario as the system-forced shutdown.  Thanks !  Greg"
37373,Amazon EC2 V1,"I get what you are trying to do. I can give you some info based on my experience. Spot instance when shutdown (auto or forced) will behave as if it was terminated. As long as you have a spot request ""open"" then you will get a new system that will boot up with your provided image.  You can therefore test a theoretical restart process, but if you are looking for intermediate data I am not sure how that will work as I have only used Spot with Instance store.  p.s. there is no such thing as long running spot instance. It can be gone faster that you can say I-have-EBS  Edited by: acmedatain on Apr 8, 2012 2:50 AM"
37373,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi,  Thanks for that.  Just for certainty, are you saying that ShutDown from the instance menu will produce the same sequence as an AWS-generated spot instance kill ?  I assumed ShutDown would leave in in the Unix ""stopped"" state, but with the instance alive and rebootable. I tried Terminate with a ""persistent"" Spot Request instance, but it didn't restart, not in the hour or so I waited anyway.  Thanks, Greg"
37373,Amazon EC2 V1,"With normal on-demand (EBS backed) instances, user initiated shutdown can be configured to stop or terminate. With instance store instances, the only option is terminate.  Stop in ec2 means that the instance is stopped and no longer associated with its host. When it starts again it will be assigned to a new host.  I don't believe its possible to keep in instance that is controlled by a spot request in a stopped state."
37373,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi,  Just wrapping this up for other readers ...  I have found that Terminating my Spot instance from my Galaxy Cloudman Gui, as per image below eventually causes a Persistent Spot Request to respawn, which allows me to test my respawn startup scripts. It can take quite a while, ceratinly 30 minutes or so.   I haven't conclusively proved that terminating it directly from the AWS Gui does the same, ie Instance Actions / Terminate, but I have to believe it would. I was just unlucky and didn't wait long enough to see it respawn when I tried that. I think I waited an hour the main time I tried it.  I think the option when you start your Instance of setting ""shutdown"" to be just ""init 0"" or ""full AWS Terminate"" is probably a red herring here. Init 0 would leave your instance hanging in a shutdown limbo state where it can technically be restarted at the pure Linux level with all config preserved, under a new IP address. Terminate should do as above.  Thanks for responses.  Greg E"
37372,Amazon EC2 V1,"Spot Requests I have been trying to get an instance using spot requests since yesterday. Every time I submit a request, I wait around 5-10 minutes, it gives me a terminated server, and then cancels the spot request. All of my requests have been for the US East region, and most but not all ""launched"" in the us-east-1a region. I have no idea what is wrong or what to do.   EDIT: For some reason, I can launch instances in us-east-1c, but not us-east-1a or 1b. If it helps, I have a running instance in 1c that I have had running since before I had this issue.

37372,Amazon EC2 V1,I can't see any of the spot requests that you've created in other Availability Zones besides us-east-1c (I think this is because you've since removed them).  Would it be possible for you to provide a spot instance request ID (looks like sir-1a2b3c4d) for me to try to investigate further?

37371,Amazon EC2 V1,Hello  I have engage the Customer service team to take a look at your account and see what could be the problem with your billing.
37371,Amazon EC2 V1,"I am seeing the similar thing on my account. The console shows 100 active spot requests, but only 20 active instances.  It is only affecting eu-west-1 spot requests right now and it looks like stopped instances count as an active spot request. For example sir-06693207 shows that i-22cad16b is active, but it isn't and our logs state that it stopped at 2012-04-14 01:52:23 UTC."
37371,Amazon EC2 V1,Seeing the same thing here in us-east.  100 active spot requests but only 10 instances (in any state).
37371,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi,  We've gone ahead and escalated this to further investigate the issue. As soon as additional information is available we will update this thread.  Regards, Zach"
37371,Amazon EC2 V1,"We have looked into the issue you were experiencing in more detail, and have resolved the underlying root cause. Specifically, we experienced an issue with the reconciliation process that updates the state of the spot instance requests once the underlying instance has been terminated. This issue caused spot instance requests to stay active after your underlying instance had been terminated. Your spot instances continued to be launched and terminated appropriately, however the state of your spot instance requests no longer reflected the correct state. Per your other question, since we meter on the state of the instance (not the state of your spot instance request), this issue has not affected the amount you will be charged. Please let us know if you see any further issues. Thanks, Dave"
37371,Amazon EC2 V1,I'm have similar issues. The spot request status turns 'active' but the instance state appers 'pending' and then 'terminated'.
37371,Amazon EC2 V1,"It looks like you had two launches that landed on unhealthy hardware, hence they were immediately terminated (so you wouldn't pay for them). This should be a relatively rare event, but can happen from time to time for either the On-Demand or Spot. We are working to reduce the chances of this occurring. However, if you encounter this again, I would recommend that you try to re-launch your instances. Thanks, Dave"

We very much need to use WebDAV but we find that we cannot use WebDAV protocol effectively because of the strange constraints of ELB:  1) ELB in http proxy mode kills some WebDAV methods - we very much need these methods to support our application!  2) ELB in tcp/ip proxy transfers all WebDAV methods (and all traffic) - but ... doesn't transfer clientsâ real IPs  We cannot effectively resolve our business task: ELB + WebDAV + real client IPs!!!   So we need to add first ELB to work with plain http traffic and second ELB to work with WebDav traffic (we are presently losing real client ips). Very ugly!

37355,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi bzzz666,  I took a look at ami-1b5b636f and it looks like its running Windows.  You can take one of the instances that fail the instance status check and detach its root EBS volume so that you can attach it as device (ex. xvdf) on another Windows instance.   Once you have enabled the volume in disk management, you can browse the filesystem and investigate the event logs located in C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs.  You may also want to verify on the AMI that the Windows Firewall is turned off for all profiles.  Regards, Chen"

37352,Amazon EC2 V1,"EBS Volumes Is there any way to attach a volume for persistance automatically after launch?  I've searched for this question, but the only answer was 2 years old... A lot happens in two years"
37352,Amazon EC2 V1,The easiest way would be to create your own AMI of an instance that you have already configured with the additional EBS volume or volumes.  Any instance launched from such and AMI will also have any additional volumes created/mounted and ready for use with each new instance created.  We do this all the time.  James
37352,Amazon EC2 V1,"agree with the Chief - this is most optimal ...   you can also do this via the Amazon API - i.e. you'd write a script to create your volume, attach instance to that volume, then launch the instance - even in this scenario, I prefer to have my own AMI with some predefined volumes ... you can still launch it via a script."
37352,Amazon EC2 V1,"I have tried just that.  I created an AMI with a volume attached. However, every time I start that AMI, a new volume is created, and then never gets deleted.  Any ideas?"
37352,Amazon EC2 V1,"The volume will only be deleted if you terminate the instance, if you just stop it then it will remain ...  I don't think you are saying you have an issue with startup correct?  I'd expect a new volume to be created the first time the AMI is used to create a running instance since you defined it that way.  If you subsequently start/stop that instance - no new volumes would be created.  If you terminated it, then you'd need to start a brand new instance using the AMI image - this would again create the necessary volumes."
37352,Amazon EC2 V1,"Maybe there is a misunderstanding.  Heres an example.  Say I start an instance, and attach a volume. That volume is now persistance. If my instance terminates the volume still exists.  When I realize something is wrong, and I start a new instance, I want all of the data from that volume on my new instance-- any data added prior to the termination would still be there attached to my new instance.  Instead, what is happening is I create an AMI with a volume attached. When I do that, Amazon creates a snapshot of the volume, and attaches the snapshot to each AMI I spin up. Any data put on the volume after launch is 'missing' if I start a new instance (really what happens is I have a stranded volume and an instance with a fresh snapshot. the stranded snapshot has the data I want on the new instance).   I think what I need to do is, via scripting, attach a volume from a start up script... possibly via cron job?  Thanks, -Rob"
37351,Amazon EC2 V1,"SFTP on AWS Pros and Cons Hi,  I am thinking about setting up an SFTP on AWS but I am seeing more Cons than Pros at this point.  I am a big fan of AWS but I don't think that this is the most cost effective/beneficial solution for me.  I want to create an SFTP site where I plan to store and transfer about 3TB of data.  Doing the math using a Large Windows Reserved instance with heavy utilization it would cost me about 4678.32 for 3 years usage and about 12695.76 for 3 years of storage (3TB).  On top of these costs there are the data transfer charges and put copy charges.  I have the option to use an in house setup with 1 hp rack (2.13 Ghz - RAM 4GB), 1 HP Memory 4 GB, 1 HP Storage Controller, 3 2TB hard drives, and 1 Microsoft windows 2008 server license for about 3,500.  I like AWS and have used it in the past to host some small applications where storage wasn't a large factor.   Could someone let me know if creating this SFTP would be better on AWS or in house?  I don't know if all of my math is correct but is there a reason to spend more than 10,000 to host this FTP on AWS?    Could someone also explain to me what kind of data charges I could expect.  Would most of the charges be internet data transfer, put, copy, etc.  Thanks I look forward to seeing your replies.  Thanks."

You can download them here: http://aws.amazon.com/developertools/351  Once you have them set up (see the getting started guide: http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/SettingUp_CommandLine.html?r=559) you'll be able to run the command  ec2-stop-instances i-f8515998  At which point you should be able to log back into the console and start your instance again.

And does creating a snapshot degrade the performance of the running instance?  Thanks,  Edited by: astrashe on Apr 16, 2012 7:07 AM"
37322,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi,  There are a couple different methods of backing up instance data. Snapshotting EBS volumes will not reboot an instance or make it inaccessible. That being said, while the snapshot is in progress it is possible to notice performance degradation. We typically recommend customers stop doing read/writes (especially database read/writes) to a volume while it is being snapshotted to ensure data consistence. Details on creating an EBS snapshot are available here: http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-creating-snapshot.html  Another option is to create an EBS AMI. An AMI (Amazon Machine Image) by default will snapshot all attached EBS volumes and create a ""one click"" method of launching new instances. This process WILL reboot the instance. It is possible if you are using the CLI, to leverage the --no reboot flag. Though this isn't recommended, it is an option. Further details on creating an EBS AMI are available here: http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Tutorial_CreateImage.html  Regards, Zach"
37322,Amazon EC2 V1,"You create an AMI from an ""instance"" and a snapshot from a ""volume"".  I'll assume here that you mean create an AMI from a running instance.  (You can create a snapshot of any EBS volume at any time, and the running state of the machine will never be affected.  All caveats about a snapshot of an active volume apply...)  When I create AMIs from my Windows instances they are always restarted; I'm not sure why that is so.  They do not seem to be ""stopped"" then ""started"" since I never lose the Elastic IP association to the instance.  I have read, though I have no personal experience, that Linux instances are NOT restarted during AMI creation.  James"

37314,Amazon EC2 V1,"Creation of AMI taking hours. Normal? Some hours ago I created an AMI from the AWS Console from an existing node. The node was powered down first, and it has 2 large drives attached (one drive 500Gb, the other 400Gb).  We want to use as the basis of our production nodes hopefully starting tonight.     The new AMI is still 'pending' 3-4 hrs later.  Is this normal? It seems to me that the last time I did this it was ready in minutes. If it's not normal, how should I handle this situation?

37314,Amazon EC2 V1,"Depending on the size of the volumes and whether snapshots have been created previously for those volumes, 3 or 4 hours is not unreasonable.  I've seen EBS snapshots take 6 or 8 hours before.  ...Matt"
37314,Amazon EC2 V1,"One way to speed up the AMI creation process is to create snapshots of the EBS volumes attached to your instance prior to calling the create image API.  As the snapshot process is differential, future snapshots will take less time, assuming not many blocks have changed.    This should reduce the snapshot process for you that is part of the AMI creation API."
37314,Amazon EC2 V1,"In case anyone else ever has a similar situation....  We bought premium tech support to get to the bottom of this. They said it typically would not take more than an hour, even with drives this big. In this case it turns out one of the drives was taking a long time to snapshot, and it is still under investigation as to why. But if you are waiting for 8 hrs for your drive to copy, it may be that something is up."
37314,Amazon EC2 V1,"After a couple more support calls, it turns out it can be normal for things to take awhile, just as Matt said above. If your instance contains a large drive that has never been snapshotted, it can take hours. From that point on, snapshots use a diff of what changed on the drive -- which can still take awhile depending on how much the drive has changed."
37313,Amazon EC2 V1,"Very old hypervisor versions? In trying to track down an occasional crash I have with the NetBSD AMIs I make available, I managed to discover that 100% of this particular crash occurs (and it occurs 100% of the time) when trying to run on hypervisor version 3.1.2 or earlier.  3.1.4 and 3.4.x seem to be fine.  Does anyone have any insight as to how Amazon manages their hypervisors?  I'm a little concerned because I know of at least one major hypervisor-crashing bug from that era which I have no indication whether they've patched it or not.  In my surveys, I've seen the following versions, among others:  3.0 (didn't get a teeny version, but yikes!) 3.1.2-128.1.10.el5 3.4.3-2.6.18 3.4.3-kaos_t1micro  ...the one that causes the most problems is 3.1.2-128.1.10.el5, which ALSO has a very serious hypervisor-crashing bug in its unpatched form.  (a domU kernel can crash the hypervisor)  It may be that Amazon have patched this (I don't really want to test), but I'm wondering if they might consider (and who I might contact about) upgrading older hypervisors to at least 3.4.3.

37307,Amazon EC2 V1,"In the AWS Management Console, go to the EC2 tab and then select Instances. The list contains a column called ""Root Device"". It will say ""ebs"" or ""instance store"". This information is also available under ""Root Device Type"" if you select the instance. It is possible to use the instance store with EBS instances as well, but that needs to be turned on explicitly."
37307,Amazon EC2 V1,"I can see that generally, but I was told that one of my instances is ""half and half"" EBS and Instance, even though it says EBS in the Management console.  I'm not quite certain how, but it would be nice to know what was what in that one."
37307,Amazon EC2 V1,"I don't think this is reflected by the AWS Management Console. In case you have a single EBS volume only, everything else is most likely instance storage. If you are on Linux, try ""df -h"". The mount points vary, but anything containing ""ephemeral"" or ""/mnt"" should raise a warning flag. In general, large storage areas not matching any attached EBS volume suggest you are in fact using instance storage.   See the documentation for more detailed information on the included instance storage for different instance types, as well as the device names and technical details. Maybe someone else knows how to check this more easily."

37305,Amazon EC2 V1,"I apologize, but no, it is not possible to recover instance storage data after you have stop/started an instance. When you perform this action, instance storage is immediately erased in preparation for any future tenants -- to ensure no one else may have access to your data.

37305,Amazon EC2 V1,"My Instance is ""ebs"", yet the data are lost? Do not have Backup? or point of restauration the Instances?"
37305,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi,  To clarify, yes your instance is EBS backed, meaning the root volume of the instance is on an EBS volume and will persist through stopping and starting the instance. In addition to the root EBS volume, your instance is configured to map /mnt to a local, ephemeral, instance store. This is detailed further in documentation provided previously, but in short, any data located here will not persist through stop/starts or hardware failure.   It is necessary to understand these concepts when architecting to ensure any critical data is stored in a location which meets durability requirements of your application.  The onus of creating back ups of system or application data remains on the customer.

Non-200 response from the server (eg, 500)  My access logs lead me to believe #3 is not the problem, but it would be useful to know whether a connection was refused or timed out.  Is there a way to find this out?  Thank you, Colin Ingarfield"
37304,Amazon EC2 V1,"Are you keeping track of the response times and HTTP codes for your load test requests? Because you have a low threshold, an instance can be taken out of service quite fast. As this is a load test, a response might not be returned within you time frame either. Whatever happens to the health check requests would probably be reflected in your load test statistics as well. In case health check requests are timing out or being refused, I would expect to see similar results for your load test requests. If this happens occasionally, it might not be entirely obvious, but maybe you can get something out of it."

37303,Amazon EC2 V1,"Sure --   To fail away and launch a replacement you would:   Terminate running instance. Launch new instance from a backup AMI you have made. If no backups exist, it would be necessary for you to launch a brand new instance from the quick launch menu.   AWS offers EBS backed instances that allows root volume data to persist if you wish to stop the instance. Additionally, you can detach/attach the root EBS volume to different instances and as a non-root volume. If a misconfiguration were to be made, this allows you to attach the volume to a different instance as a non-root volume and revert and configuration changes made and/or recover any needed critical data.

If you have a snapshot of the root volume, simply create another volume from that snapshot, then detach the old EBS volume (attached at /dev/sda1) and attach the newly created one at the same location. Please me sure the instance is in STOPPED status while you do this. Once the volumes are swapped, you can then start the instance.   If you created an AMI before changing the key, all you have to do is launch a replacement instance from this AMI and you should be back to where you were before changing the keys.  If you created neither a snapshot nor an AMI right before changing the keys, I'm afraid, there is nothing to revert back to.

37286,Amazon EC2 V1,"It depends how you setup your health check.  ELB will send a health check using the instance IP address and the URL you provided (no hostname in the request).  You need to make sure your instances respond to that request with an HTTP status code of 200. If they don't then ELB will consider these instances down.  You can simulate this call by ssh-ing into your machine and issuing a curl request: curl -vv http://YOUR INSTANCE PRIVATE IP:80/PATH TO HEALTH CHECK   For example, if my instance's internal IP is 10.0.0.1 and the URL for health check is /status.html I would issue: curl -vv http://10.0.0.1:80/status.html   If the result is not an HTTP status code 200, then you need to configure your server so that request will not fail."

Stop the webserver, make an AMI. 2. Now from AMI start another instance, this way, we will have two servers with same data. 3. Now goto load balancers and define a load balancer and add these two servers.

37284,Amazon EC2 V1,"Your steps seems correct.  One additional step is to map your domain to the load balancer address. If you want a regular domain (i.e. www.mydomain.com) then you simply need to make ""www"" a CNAME record that points to the address of the load balancer.  If you want to use a naked domain (i.e. mydomain.com - without the 'www') you'll have to use Route53 as your DNS server for your domain and then you'll be able to use a trick they have to map a named domain to an ELB.  Also, in general you don't have to have more than 1 server to use ELB (Elastic Load Balancer). It is a good practice to use one if you want to be able to switch servers in the background with minimal downtime."

Now i want to creat a load balancer with conditionl like if load average increase more then 60%, traffic should go to second server in the load balancer.  Please guide how to achieve this.  Thank you."
37284,Amazon EC2 V1,"What type of instance are you running? Perhaps you simply need a bigger instance or need to configure your server better. You shouldn't reach a point where 15-20 users accessing your server makes it go to 100% load.  What you are referring is auto-scaling. That's a bit though to setup since you need to do that with AMIs. Which means, any code change or fix you do will require you to create a new AMI etc.  I would try these steps before thinking on elastic load balancing:  Try optimize the server configuration.  If its an app accessing a database, consider using memcache locally (or even elastic cache) Consider using a stronger instance   Then, if you passed that and the load is still high, or you simply want to have redundancy by running the second server in a different availability zone I would consider putting a load balancer. At first, it should be a non auto-scaling load balancer."
37284,Amazon EC2 V1,"Thanks Eran,  Actually instance is T1.Micro and i have less funds at the moment to go for bigger one, i just want to load balance the Server resources by sharing traffic accross two or three server (micro instances).  Please suggest the steps to achieve this.  tks"
37284,Amazon EC2 V1,"I see.  So... the reason the instance spikes to 100% load is due to how micro instances work. Micro instances don't have a dedicated CPU and they use burstable CPU which is free CPU cycles from the host machine the micro instances run on.  When the load reaches 100% it usually means that the machine didn't get CPU allocation from the host.  In any way I would do what I suggested before to further optimize the application your machine is running.  Then, depending on the load on your application I would consider adding just an extra micro instance and have those two machines behind a load balancer.  If you have time to spend on it and you can configure your instances with a dedicated AMI that can work by just turning it on you might want to consider auto scaling. But it requires quite a bit of work to actually work."

I was reading a few articles on how to create a new database (MySQL or PostgreSQL), but I still have a few questions. I read that using the instance volume (in my case, /dev/sda1) is probably a bad idea because the instance might be restarted too many times. I should, instead, use Elastic Block Store (EBS) to create my database. However, browsing the AWS Manager Console, I realized that /dev/sda1 is already an EBS volume.  Should I create a new EBS volume for the database? Should this volume be a new partition in /dev/sda (for example, /dev/sda2) or a completely different device? Is there a step-by-step document covering the use case I mentioned? Most articles I find seem to be either old or targetted at other operating systems.  Thanks a lot, Tiago"
37282,Amazon EC2 V1,"All good questions... and answers depend on what you are trying to do, performance/availability requirements, etc.  Typically, it's not a great idea to put all your data on the boot ""drive"", and the same holds at EC2... depending.  You are still free-tier, so you are experimenting.  You might just use the boot EBS volume for initial testing, and configure a ""real"" server once you learn more.  We use SQL Server, and our data resides across two EBS volumes, both attached as (for me, it's Windows), xvdf and xvdg; then, a mirrored partition is created and the filesystem formatted as mirrored.  We prefer availability n the even that an EBS volume fails.  Some folks stripe across multiple EBS volumes for performance.  (These EBS volumes are not real drives, per-se, so folks have done lots of performance testing to see which configurations yield which results.)  Search the forums here and you'll find some words about various DB configurations.  If you think this instance will live on for a while, and possibly even become a production server, do not put the DB files on the boot volume.  I feel safe writing those words.  James"

37279,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi,   I did not set any iptables. The access to this instance should be identical to that of the two other instances that are reachasble (and which i set up on the same day).  Will i lose any data by stopping the instance?"
37279,Amazon EC2 V1,"Since your instance is EBS-backed, you can safely perform a stop and start without losing any data. As I mentioned in my last response, something inside the instance is either blocking the SSH service or the port which we have no visibility of and you can perform further troubleshooting by attaching the root volume of your instance to another working instance.   If you have any additional questions, please let us know."

37276,Amazon EC2 V1,"What is your approach to maintaining EC2 always-on access? I'm not saying there is anything wrong with AWS.  I have been using S3 for more than a year, and just started with EC2.  There many threads in this forum are evidence of intermittent high latency; disappearing instances; freezes; and other various outages that affect individual customers but not AWS as a whole.  What are the best policies for ensuring your hosted product is always available?  A. Do you maintain your own fall-back server on the side?  B. Do you maintain instances in other AWS regions for fall-back purposes?  C. Do you maintain instances in other clouds besides AWS for fall-back purposes?  D. Does AWS host only your non-critical systems?  E. How long (seconds, minutes, hours, days) can your clients operate on caches alone?  I have my own ideas on how to approach these issues, but as I'm just getting started on EC2 it's probably best if I listen more than I speak...  Thanks"
37276,Amazon EC2 V1,"Individual EC2 instances can, and definitely will, fail at any time. You can work around these kind of issues by setting up your cloud environment according to best practices as outlined in the AWS Architecture Center. By carefully studying this material, you will learn how to design for high availability as well as scalability. Elastic Load Balancing and Auto Scaling are two very useful services. They can help you eliminate the need to rely on any specific instance. When instances can simply come and go, any failing ones can be replaced automatically by the system. If you place your instances in multiple availability zones, which are basically different data centers, you will be protected against failures in a single location.  It takes some amount of work to get everything up and running according to best practices, but in return the impact will be very low once these issues do hit. Many of these things are expected. Hardware can of course fail. There is not much that can be done about that. The set of tools provided by AWS is usually enough to get you through the occasional small hiccups.  In my opinion, the real problem is the bigger outages happening from time to time. This is when even best practices can't help you. Here are two post-mortems to illustrate what kind of issues I'm talking about:  Summary of the Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS Service Disruption in the US East Region Summary of the Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, and Amazon RDS Service Event in the EU West Region  As you can see, really bad things can happen. They do take this very seriously, but that doesn't really help when you get stuck in the middle of it. This is where a multi-region approach comes in. I don't have any data to back it up, but my impression is that relatively few customers choose this route. Most of the time, the basic building blocks are enough. As each region is isolated, additional work is required to break the region boundary. Most AWS services operate within the region only.  To summarize, follow best practices and you'll be fine most of the time. If your use case requires a little extra availability, explore the possibility of moving into a second region."
37275,Amazon EC2 V1,"MySQL cluster using Micro instances as data nodes: Would that work? Hi,  I'm considering creating a MySQL cluster. Would it work if I user Micro instances, considering that they bring just 613MB of RAM?  I need to host two database there. One is really small (tables with just a few hunder records), and the other one not so small, about 1 million records, but that is just a log that usually gets a lot of inserts but few selects. In fact, I'm planning to replicate that big database and read from the replica, not from that cluster.  By the way: I do know about the RDS service, but as long as it is impossible to change the time zone there, I won't use it. It's a pitty, I was just about to start using it, but dealing with that problem has been a dealbreaker for me.  Tom"
37275,Amazon EC2 V1,"It will probably work but it will have variable performance.   Micro instances don't have reserved CPU, the use bursts and in general their priority for I/O will be lower than other instances so you may end up in situations where certain writes or reads take a long time due to CPU or I/O allocations.  At minimum get either the m1.small or m1.medium instances which have at least 1 reserved CPU. If you plan on running these servers 24x7, with high utilization it should be relatively cheap.  And regarding timezone, I would advise to ALWAYS save the data in the database in UTC/GMT and perform the timezone conversion in your application code.  That way you won't have any time issues what-so-ever.  Edited by: Eran Sandler on Apr 15, 2012 6:21 AM"
37275,Amazon EC2 V1,"Adding to what Eran Sandler said, there is a section in the EC2 documentation covering micro instance concepts.  http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts_micro_instances.html"
37275,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi Eran,  Thanks for your responses.  Regarding the Micro instance, I guess you are right. I have been using them for my app for some time and so far no problems, but I forgot about the CPU issue, that I don't have a steady warranted speed. I will check the prices for reserved small instances.  Regarding the RDS service, I'm still wondering why is it impossible to change the time zone. When we get that service, don't we get a private instance indirectly?  One more question: What about the ""beta"" status for RDS? Normally, my understanding is that beta means ""could be full of bugs, not realiable, users are testing it now, don't use it in production if it is a critical part of your system"". So, should we avoid using it in production?"
37275,Amazon EC2 V1,"In the AWS world, beta services are considered to be stable, but does not yet contain all features they would like to offer in the final product. They kind of build a minimum viable product, listen to customer feedback, and add features to make the offering more complete. You can definitely use RDS in production."
37275,Amazon EC2 V1,"Technically you are correct that its probably an Amazon Linux instance with MySQL preconfigured, however perhaps due to other things like replication they've decided to make sure its not settable at the server level.  Have you read this link. They offer some ways of handling it at the application level in various way (one of which is setting the timezone at the connection level).  But in any case I would make sure my code handles UTC/GMT and makes the conversion at the application level. It's the correct approach in all of these system."
37275,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi again Eran,  Yes, I visited the link you referred and indeed it's a good summary of the alternatives.  Right now, I'm thinking about two options:  1- Converting all my current date_time values to UTC/GMT, configure my MySQL installation to start using UTC from now on, and make changes to my app so it shows the values converted to whatever time zone the user lives in. Then, once everything works, migrate from my own MySQL to the RDS service with multi-AZ.  2- Using MySQL Cluster server, using EC2 Small instances.   Right now, I'm using a couple of Micro instances. One for the Master, and one for the slave, and replicating. It works great, very stable and fast enough, but I don't have an automatic failover procedure. If something happens to the master I need to have my smartphone with me to receive an SMS alert, and the redirect the elastic IP (that the app uses to connects to the DB) to the slave server. But I wan't an automaic failover procedure."
37275,Amazon EC2 V1,"I'm would convert everything to UTC and update the app code because that's good database programming technique in any way.  In regards to use or not use RDS, it mostly depends on your administrative skills and time you want to spend configuring all of this.  If you don't want to mess with replication and backup too much and you need high survivability of this data, I would go with a Multi-AZ RDS configuration."
37275,Amazon EC2 V1,"I'm offering a service with a 99.99% availabilty, so I need the best solution I can afford to get that. My architecture right now is:   DNS, in Godaddy's hands. Amazon's ELB Two Linux instances, each one with Tomcat and its own MySQL installation for some data that doesn't change and is being read intensively (geolocation data). The app in these Tomcat installation connects to a common database that changes, through an Elastic IP Elastic IP, that usually points to the Master server A Master and a Slave MySQL, replicating (asynchronously, which is fine because the data doesn't change very often)   The weakness right now, as you can see, is my database. What happens if its Linux fails? Or if MySQL fails? Or if the hardware behind the instance fails? I need to have my phone with me to receive an SMS, and that is stressing.  I can learn anything, say its MySQL Cluster or RDS service. I also have the time to implement either solution. What I don't have is a big budget. I need the best availabilily. What would you recommend? Cluster, or RDS?"
37275,Amazon EC2 V1,"To run a master/slave replication (and assuming you want failover) you'll have to run at least 2 dedicated instances. They should also probably run in 2 different availability zones.  2 x m1.small reserved instances in heavy utilization would cost you: $0.016/hr * 24 * 30 = ~$11.52 USD x 2 = ~$23.04/mo Plus $195 * 2 = $390 up front (for the reservation)  2 x Small Multi-AZ reserved in heavy utilization would cost you: $0.054/hr * 24 * 30 = ~$38.88/mo Plus $390 up front (for the reservation)  EBS storage and I/O pricing is the same in both cases.  So the monthly price isn't that different. What you do get is backups and you don't need to hassle with replication, master/slave, etc.  I don't know what's your budget, but it seems that for a relatively small fee (~$15/mo) you get a reasonable deal."
37275,Amazon EC2 V1,"Right now, for the replication, I'm using just micro instances. Very cheap, but no automatic failover. I have thought about using one of those open-source solucions like hearthbeat+pacemaker, but that would require an extra linux instance. That instance would be cheap (Micro again) but what if that Linux instance hangs up or fails? What it the hearbeat and/or pacemaker fails? I would get more single points of failure to worry about.   You are right. Both options (My own cluster using 2 small instances, with heavy reservations, or using RDS multi-AZ, small, heavy reservation) cost almost the same, just US$15 more monthly for the RDS which is not significant.  Basically, these are my thoughts now ( ""+"" =advantage, ""-"" = disadvantage):  Cluster: ===== + If one data node fails, it still works. Not a minute of downtime + I have complete access to the configuration files, timezone setting, logs, Linux, etc. And having 2 more Linux instances will always be useful for other purposes! + No need to change timezone  The whole cluster would be in the same AZ (using different AZ's would be too slow), so it the AZ is unavailable, I would have to change the Elastic IP to an external slave the cluster is replicating to, so at the end if the AZ crashes, I have no automatic failover to change to the replication slave Requires other instances (administration, MySQL), even though I already use a couple of instances for Tomcat and they could do that job   RDS (muti-az): ========= + If one AZ fails, the system will failover to the other. So I dont need to worry about that, it is automatic. + Easier to configure, setup and administrate + I will still use INNODB, dont need to change that + No need for other instances (administration, MySQL) as with a Cluster  It takes 3 minutes to failover, while in the cluster is inmediate. No access to change the timezone, to the config files, to the OS. No Linux instances to take advantage of, for other purposes Have to change to UTC, a hassle right now"

37267,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hello.  If you started the server with inside a new instance with a working AMI, this remove the posibility of a hardware issue. because we do not have access to your data inside the instance we cannot comment into what could be the problem  to troubleshoot this, please start mysql with this command  ./mysql --debug  and check the output to see if it give you more information, if you want you could paste it here and we will try to help you"
37267,Amazon EC2 V1,Jimmy --  Thanks so much for your reply. The problem turned out to be with my /etc/mysql/my.cnf file. I was binding to an internal AWS IP address for this machine (not 127.0.0.1) because I need to allow outside connections. Well the IP address of the machine had changed and mysqld was puking on binding to port 3306.  So much stress for such a little thing. Thank you again...  Michael
37267,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hello   Not a problem!, I'm glad that you found the problem, to prevent this problem again, please bind the mysql to the internal address, and to give access to external connections please use an EIP.  Let me know if you need anything else"

37266,Amazon EC2 V1,"Thank you for providing the additional information. This helped me determining the problem being faced by your instance. Around 14:27 PDT, the underlying host encountered an issue and this was corrected automatically after a reboot. Unfortunately, this caused your instance to reboot as well.   After the reboot, the instance failed to boot up completely and this is evident from the console log:  mountall: Event failed  mount: special device /home/ubuntu/glassfish/nodeagents/NodeAgent3/POS_NodeAgent3/applications/j2ee-modules/AbsoluteSolutions-Retail-POSServer/jasper does not exist  mountall: mount /export/share/jasper-pos-1 540 terminated with status 32  mountall: Filesystem could not be mounted: /export/share/jasper-pos-1  An error occurred while mounting /export/share/jasper-pos-1. Press S to skip mounting or M for manual recovery   Since this instance is not EBS-backed, you will need to launch a replacement instance from your most recent AMI. I would also suggest checking out some of the EBS-backed instances that allow you to perform a stop/start to migrate to another healthy host.  Please let me know if you have any additional questions."
37266,Amazon EC2 V1,"Ok, for now, I understand that I should install EBS for EC2 instance to make a system snapshot at anytime (and recovery it at the time I want to).  I thought that the benefit of using EBS is for expanding storage for EC2 only, because I think that AWS EC2 instance will be never die and really reliable >.< (believe me, I didn't blame you guys, AWS is the most reliable cloud service right now).  But I use RDS as DB platform for my web servers,  so the critical concerns of losing data is on RDS instance and AWS do this part very well for providing auto snapshot for RDS instance.  For my choice, I think that losing some data or disk volume on my EC2 (web server) instance is not the critical part of us (we do clustering too, so this is only a single node that not causes the whole application down).  If we decide to install EBS on EC2 instances for recovery purpose, I think this will increase the subscription cost for us more than it should be.   So, as I see that you can view the console log :  ""An error occurred while mounting /export/share/jasper-pos-1. Press S to skip mounting or M for manual recovery""     Could you do anything to let the system continuing boot itself up? (now I think that the system is still stuck in prompting the user to ""Skip"" or do ""Manual Recovery"") ***     (I can't ssh to the instance since it isn't booted up >.<)    The file on those path   "" 1) mount: special device /home/ubuntu/glassfish/nodeagents/NodeAgent3/POS_NodeAgent3/applications/j2ee-modules/AbsoluteSolutions-Retail-POSServer/jasper 2) mountall: Filesystem could not be mounted: /export/share/jasper-pos-1 ""  are not critical. I can reinstall them easily.  But if I've to launch the new instance and setup all of the webserver stacks, this will consume a couple hours.  Any help will be really appreciate.  Thank you very much ^^"""
37266,Amazon EC2 V1,"Thank you for sharing your feedback. We value your feedback very much and try to improve our services based on your comments.   Unfortunately, we don't have console access to the instance to complete the step.   As you mentioned, you may use the EBS volume for additional storage but in ephemeral-based instances the root volume is also ephemeral (non EBS) so hardware failures can cause possible downtime.   If you use the EBS-backed instances, the root volume is also on Elastic block storage which allows easier failover.   I would also suggest creating AMIs of your customized instances to easily launch newer instances in future if you encounter a similar situation.  Please let me know if you have any additional questions."
37265,Amazon EC2 V1,"How to reset root password on Linux AMI instance Hi,  Just recently, I have removed the vim editor due to problems of syntax highlighting. I figured out that the best way to go is to install and compile from source in order to resolve the issue. However, I overlooked the removal process since it also removes the package sudo.x86_64 that depends on vim package. I have been using the ec2-user with sudo privileges to install/update/remove/administer the system. At present I can't use sudo anymore to perform these tasks. Switching to root user prompts for a password that cannot log you in since the root account's password has not been set. I'm totally locked up now. Connecting thru ssh to the machine using root account is not permitted. otherwise.  I would like to ask some help if it is possible to reset root password before I deciding the last-resort -- terminate the instance and start from scratch.  Any help would greatly be appreciated.  Thanks.  jongbergs"
37265,Amazon EC2 V1,"There is something you can try if you have enough linux knowledge.  Move the volume to a new instance, mounted as an extra volume. Change the /root/.ssh/authorized_keys file so it will work to login as root. As well as set PermitRootLogin to yes in /etc/ssh/sshd_config.  Those changes should allow root login, you should be able to fix sudo once you move the volume back to the original instance.  Obviously once you fix sudo, you probably want to revert back the changes to allow root login."

Also, you can check are you using proper key for ssh by examining output of the file:  $ cat newone.ssh  Check that output (don`t post it here since it is your key), there should be lines on the beginning and the end of the file, like this:  -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----  We just want to be sure that you are not using Putty-generated key.   If the file newone.ssh is beginning with something different (like ""ssh-dss""), then mostly you are trying to use Putty-generated key (ppk), which can`t be used from Linux.  If you are using Windows computer to connect to an instance, you should load your ppk file to Putty, and choose username which you want, ec2-user or root (Connection -> Data -> When username is not specified -> Prompt)  Kind regards,  Igor  Edited by: Igor@AWS on Aug 11, 2011 4:56 PM  Edited by: Igor@AWS on Aug 11, 2011 4:57 PM"

37265,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hello,  In that case I would recommend the following (it is described by D. Johansson in second message in this thread, here are the steps in more detail):  1) create AMI from your running instance. If your instance need to be in running state all the time, use command line tools, as described here:  http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/index.html?creating-an-ami-ebs.html  This will also create snapshot of your current root volume.  2) Create volume from that snapshot (let`s call it volume A) 3) Create completely new instance (let`s call it instance B) 3) Attach volume A to instance B, here is useful link for that step:  http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/index.html?ebs-attaching-volume.html  At this step, we would recommend to name new device as ""/dev/sdf1""  4) Create directory in instance B (for example /media/OLD) and mount volume A to that directory by issuing ""mount /dev/xvdf1 /media/OLD""  Do not be confused by new device name ""dev/sdf1 ->  /dev/xvdf1"", it is explained in link above.  Now you can try to debug why sshd is not working.  For example, examine log file /media/OLD/var/log/secure and other logs and try to check what is happening, also you can verify/change sshd conf file /media/OLD/etc/ssh/sshd_config, check situation in /media/OLD/root/.ssh/ directory, etc  After you checked and repaired sshd configuration on old volume, you can start new instance from AMI, by using that old root volume.  After stopping and starting instances, be aware that they might receive new IP addresses and new DNS hostnames (depends on your exact configuration).  Best regards,  Igor"

37264,Amazon EC2 V1,Windows Server 2008  - Status checks fail after installing Kaspersky AV Hi  I have noticed that my windows server 2008 (ami-6b8eb71f) server fails to start after installing Kaspersky file server antivirus and updating the signature files  Status checks fail and I can no longer access my EC2 instance. This is the second time I have build my instance from scratch in two days.  Has anyone noticed this behaviour when working with Kaspersky products?   What antivirus product does work without issues against Amazon Windows AMI?  Regards.  G
37264,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi,  Any antivirus should work fine with EC2. Most consumer AV products also include a firewall that is often preconfigured to block incoming port 3389 (one used by Windows RDP service).   You can use any antivirus program or software firewall as long as it's not blocking connection on port 3389. When you're installing an AV program, please make sure to choose custom setup and disable its firewall functionality or at least make sure that RDP connection on port 3389 is open.  I searched and located this so please see if this link helps: http://support.kaspersky.com/us/faq/?qid=208286427  Since the access is already blocked over RDP, you may have to set up the instance again unless you created a custom AMI. You can create a custom AMI right before installing and/or updating your AV/IS product so that if it blocks access, you can revert back to your custom AMI with your preinstalled applications and configuration.

Regards, Mary mary@AWS wrote: Hi Dennis,  Sorry for the delay in responding. Could you please post the instance ID of this instance?  Regards, Mary Thanks for your feedback.  The instance ID is i-26bb3941.  The AMI ID is ami-eb8c5482  In a phone call with AWS today, I learned that I had actually created the wrong kind of instance, so I am terminating it and I will start anew with a micro instance, so that I can get things running without incurring costs while experimenting.  The reason I chose the larger-than-necessary instance is because, looking at the list of instance types, I did not see another one that offered Microsoft IIS which is something that I need.  Overall, what I am trying to do is build a server online to replace the machine that is now hosted at a local data center, so that I will not have to worry about the hardware, memory, disk media, etc.  My server runs, in addition to IIS, the following software programs:  FileMaker Server, FileZilla (FTP) and Cold Fusion.  My problem in creating the instance that is now terminated is that I was only able to access it via RDP, and I could not figure out how to access it via FTP so that I could upload my installation software for the other programs.  If you can answer that too, I will appreciate it.  Perhaps I need to manage the ""Security Groups"" in the AWS console, instead of doing it via the Microsoft Control Panels?  Now, I have created a new instance and regardless whether I use the public IP address or the public DNS, I cannot even successfully PING the instance.    I would just like to learn what I need to do to make this ""instance"" accessible to me with whatever program I can use to transfer files to it.  FTP and Timbuktu are both installed, but I cannot make a successful connection.  In the AWS Documentation, it states: ---Restricting Access to an IP Address or IP Address Range When you create a security group rule, the source defaults to 0.0.0.0/0. The syntax is used is Classless InterDomain Routing (CIDR) notification. The default value allows any IP address to connect to your instance. You might want to use this setting for a web server so that anyone can see your web pages. However, for RDP access, you need to control who can access your instance, so you should use that security group rule to restrict access to a specific IP address or range of IP addresses.  ... so I don't understand why, even though I have added three ports to the security group and they all have the CIDR setting for the allowable IP range, I still cannot connect to the instance from outside the Amazon cloud.

37259,Amazon EC2 V1,"This is not my area of expertise, but maybe I can offer some general advice regarding the AWS environment. First of all, you can think of an EC2 instance as a regular server, albeit running in a more restricted network environment. Windows as well as different Linux distributions are available for you to choose from. When you launch an EC2 instance, you can select the AMI (Amazon Machine Image) you wish to use. Which one did you select for the Linux instance? The image id looks something like ""ami-xxxxxxxx"". You can find this information when launching the instance or in the instance list (EC2 tab, Instances).  In general, each Linux distribution comes with a package manager of some kind. In case you selected the Amazon Linux AMI, it is called ""yum"". You can search for a package like gcc (""yum search gcc"") and install it (""sudo yum install gcc""). If you are unable to find a required package, you can download and compile the software yourself. This is a bit more advanced though, but if you are familiar with any Linux distribution you already know the basics.  As you have noted, you can access Linux instances using SSH. When you need to transfer files to your instance, SCP (which is based on SSH) will work out of the box. On Linux/Mac, use the ""scp"" command.  To summarize, an EC2 instance is simply a virtual server. If you are familiar with this kind of setup in a non-cloud environment, you can use most of these skills in EC2 as well. The AWS cloud is huge and offers many innovative services, but in the end your instances are just plain old servers."

I'm trying to come up with realistic estimates of what AWS will cost us if we end up using it.  We plan on using cloud formation and auto scaling to serve the variable load.  However, I'm having some trouble understanding the different types of reserved instances you can buy.  For a large instance with medium utilization for one year you pay $640 ($0.096 per hour). So to get the best bang for your buck, you need to run the instance for about 280 days (280*24*0.096 = 645.12). After you run it for 280 days, do you still get the instance for 0.096 an hour, or is your instance considered used up?  We will always be having two instances running so to me it would make sense to pay for two instances in heavy utilization. The thing I don't understand is that if you pay $780 ($0.064 per hour) upfront for a large instance for one year (heavy utilization) it doesn't add up to me (365*24*0.064=560.64) so shouldn't you be paying $560.64 for the instance for the year? Where am I going wrong?  Thanks for any help/clarification."
37252,Amazon EC2 V1,"Make sure to take both the upfront payment and the hourly rate into account. If you purchase a Heavy reservation for a Large instance in that particular region, you end up paying something like $1340,64 ($780 upfront + 560,64).  No matter which reservation type you purchase, the instance can be used as much or as little as you need. You will be charged at the lower hourly rate until the reservation expires after one or three years. Note that Heavy reservations are charged in full though. You basically end up paying for every hour. With a Light/Medium reservation, you can terminate the instance at any time to avoid further charges."
37252,Amazon EC2 V1,"Ok, I think I get it. So you pay the upfront cost, but you still pay the lower hourly rate? I thought the upfront cost covered the instance for the year. I thought it sounded to good to be true."
37252,Amazon EC2 V1,"Yes, that is correct. If you compare it to on-demand, the total cost for say a year will be much lower when you have a reservation. Keep in mind that you will incur other charges as well, such as data transfer and EBS volume storage/usage. But if you decide to go with AWS, and can somewhat predict what you need for the coming year, instance reservations will provide great savings."

Once it has been attached, you can then view the contents of the volume and examine the original instance's system logs for indicators of why the instance is not coming up healthy.  Regards, Karen"
37249,Amazon EC2 V1,"ec2 instance stuck in stopping state Hi,  We have an ec2 stuck in stopping state.    We received an email notification stating that the instance was going to be retired. So I went to the console and issued a restart as suggested.   The instance was stuck in the stopping state for about an hour.  So I ssh'd in and issued sudo reboot.  Immediately after that I was no longer able to ssh in, and the web services on that system stopped responding.  After an another hour or so issued several force stop commands from the console.  Another couple of hours have past It's still stopping.  ebs backed. i-b96845d5  What can i do to get this instance restarted?

37243,Amazon EC2 V1,"Loss of data from instance storage I launched a high memory instance with block storage enabled using the API. I transferred some information to the instance storage. However, when I rebooted the machine after a several hours of shut down, the instance stores were cleared. In the user guide it states the instance stores aren't cleared on reboot:  If an instance reboots (intentionally or unintentionally), the data on the instance store will survive.  Does this mean the drive failed over night, or something else happened? For permanent store, is it better to just use EBS?"
37243,Amazon EC2 V1,"My instance ID is i-887ffbef.  Could this happened because I stopped the instance and started it, as opposed to just rebooting it?"
37243,Amazon EC2 V1,"Someone can correct me if I am wrong.  But if you stop the instance and restart it, instance stor will get cleared.  You have to explicitly reboot the instance to save the data.  IMO, go EBS!"

37242,Amazon EC2 V1,Figured it out.
37241,Amazon EC2 V1,"Improving EC2 Boot Performance In my application, a client launches an EC2 instance dynamically from an AMI on EBS and sends data to it. The instance processes the data, sends the results back, and terminates itself. I know that using EBS makes the boot faster, but are there any other ways to make it faster other than using a faster instance type? Also, when the state of the instance is ""running"", does that mean that it has finished booting?  Thanks, TJ"
37241,Amazon EC2 V1,"The ""running"" state means that the virtual machine is ""on""; the boot sequence will come some time later, and is not reflected in the ""status"".  I guess you'll either need to poll the instance somehow, or use some program run at startup to send some signal or set some flag somewhere.  I'm curious; about how long is the instance actually in use, typically?  Minutes, hours?  Even if an instance is up only for a few minutes, the charge is for an hour, so the savings obtained by terminating so soon might not be worth it.  Also, launching an instance from an AMI usually takes WAY longer than starting a stopped instance that has been created from an AMI.  Note that when an instance is stopped, (exists but not running), you are only charged for storage.  Perhaps a pool of waiting ""stopped"" instances, started only when needed by your customers, would work better?  James"
37241,Amazon EC2 V1,"Thanks for the response. The intention is for the instance to be in use for a few minutes.    Regarding the polling, so none of the instance status information like reachability could be used for determining that it's finished booting?  I know starting a stopped instance would help a lot. How fast would it take to boot up a say a stopped a basic Windows AMI? 5 minutes? Longer?  Thanks, TJ"
37241,Amazon EC2 V1,"In my experience, less than 5 minutes.  (That said, once it's up, that first hour is already charged.  It would be nice if you could use that instance if some other request came in from another customer.)  So, how do you get the ""workload"" to the instance once it has booted?  Does it need to be a new invocation for each new customer request?  It jsut seems that there could be a more efficient way to do this.  James"
37241,Amazon EC2 V1,"Sorry about not mentioning this before. One of my main requirements is that it be as secure as possible. If the instance is launched and then terminated, the window for opportunity to hack is small. Is there any case where using the start/stopped instance would be more vulnerable?  If you think security wouldn't be an issue with stopped instances, I think I will just do it that way instead of launching a new instance every time. I could consider keeping them up for awhile to process other requests, but in my case the time between two different requests could be a few minutes to a few weeks (wasting money). This is why I have been starting/stopping a new instance per request.  Thanks, TJ"
37241,Amazon EC2 V1,"Well, I have to agree that hacking into an instance that is ""terminated"" would be tough.  Hacking into a ""stopped"" instance, (which of course actually exists), is easier; if somebody had your AWS credentials they could start the instance and possibly gain access.  If the instance that originally had the data simply no longer exists, even with your credentials they could not get the data.  James"

37238,Amazon EC2 V1,"which ec2 ami should i use for an (ec2-based) ftp server? I've spent the past week researching AWS and think I have read enough to finally launch my EC2 instance.  Although, I'm not sure which AMI I should choose...I realize that EBS-based root devices are the future and S3-based (instance store) root devices are a thing of the past.  Although, reading all of the benefits of EBS-based EC2 AMIs, I still think that an S3-based EC2 AMI might actually be a better fit for me.  Here is my brief use case:  I am creating a service that will allow FTP-enabled security cameras to configure their settings to use my (EC2-based) FTP server (using credentials they are given upon account sign up on my website) to upload an image every 1, 2, 5, 10 or 30 seconds.  I plan to store all of the images in Amazon S3 buckets, but need to provide ""FTP upload access"" to my buckets, which is not available.  SO MY IDEA IS TO RUN AN EC2 INSTANCE 24/7 AS AN FTP SERVER.    And my EC2 instance's FTP server will save the files to an S3 bucket.  I realize that there are 3rd party options to connect to an S3 bucket via FTP, but I would like to have the FTP server that is used be controlled/run by myself.  So my question is:   CAN PEOPLE PLEASE RECOMMEND THE BEST (LINUX-BASED) EC2 AMI TO USE FOR AN INSTANCE RUNNING ONLY AS AN FTP SERVER 24/7/365?  THE INSTANCE SHOULD NEVER HAVE TO BE PAUSED, STOPPED, ETC AND I DO NOT NEED/WANT PHP, MYSQL, ETC INSTALLED.  Thanks in advance!"

37234,Amazon EC2 V1,"Total newbie question on EBS Hello,  I have only just started to get invovled in cloud yesterday and still trying to assimilate all the information. I appologise in advance of what appears to be a total newbie question, however I cant seem to find the answer!  Having worked through the night (God bless Kenco) I have managed to setup 1 medium EC2 running Ubuntu 11 64bit, 2 EBS volumes (8 gb for the EC2 instance, 20 GB for files), RDS with MySQL and an Elastic IP.  I have installed (independently - not through LAMP) apache2, PHP5, PHPmyAdmin and Wordpress - and its all working fine except for the fact that everything is installed in the initial EBS volume. I cant get wordpress to install on my 2nd EBS - the 20Gb one.  I want to keep the operating system files seperate from the wordpress files, giving me redundancy if a an  OS update goes wrong or I want to switch to windows etc. Given how hard its been to try and find an answer, I'm wondering if I am going about it the wrong way. It seems silly to me, but should I be installing wordpress on S3, consideriny MYSQL is in RDS? To go from S3 to EBS to EC2 to RDS and back sounds like a really long path....  The environment I am trying to test is for a website that handels about 15K visitors a month, with seasonal peaks at about 25K a month. Page load speeds and failover / availability are my biggest goals. No one wants to go down the route of NetFlix!  Thanks in advance."
37234,Amazon EC2 V1,"If I understand your words, I think you are taking the (a) right approach.  Now, I don't know how to install a working Wordpress stack, so I'm not sure what the trouble is, or why the Wordpress and/or MySQL database files cannot be placed on the non-boot volume.  (I don't think S3 needs to be in the mix here, not do I think RDS is going to do better for your needs than a locally installed MySQL.  Everything is a trade-off, but I think your fine starting with a complete EC2 solution, until perhaps you are compelled at some point to change.)  So, is the second volume actually available, and is there a filesystem there?  You can place files there?  I don't know how to install MySQL, but there must be some way to tell it where to go.  I would have to guess the same of Wordpress too, though I don't know how.  For fun, you could try a pre-configured bitnami.org Wordpress AMI.  These are ready-to-launch AMIs, that have your Wordpress site up in a few minutes.  The place everything on the boot drive tough.  http://bitnami.org/stack/wordpress  Note that you could go with everything on the boot drive, and make an AMI from the currently runnign instance before making any changes; if there was trouble, you would launch a new instance from the AMI created prior to the breaking change.  This isn't as flexible, maybe, as a configuration wall all ""data"" resided on another volume.  I say ""maybe"" because is there really going to be such a perfect ""separation"" that you could un-mount the volume, mount it back to some running instance, and be up and running quickly?  I don't know the answer, but it's worth considering.  James"

37233,Amazon EC2 V1,I am seeing similar errors this morning while talking to the east coast.
37232,Amazon EC2 V1,"Instance problems sluggish / network / IO AWS People,  I sense a disturbance in the force...  My instance i-0a9d5b68 is behaving badly.  Yesterday, there was an intermittent DNS problem which caused all the internal addresses like ip-#-#-#-#.ec2.internal to resolve to 127.0.0.1.  It was also having intermittent problems connecting to s3 buckets (unable to resolve).  It feels like 10% of pings are an order of magnitude higher than the rest: if 9 out of 10 pings are 2-3 milliseconds, the 10th ping is 20 ms.  If 9/10 pings are 20-30 ms, the 10th ping is 300ms.  Today, the instance seems sluggish one minute, ok the next, sluggish one minute, ok the next.  For example, a simple ""who""(enter) will not actually process the carriage return for a minute or so.  Very bad IO performance as well.  In the past couple weeks I've created a couple instances using this previously stable AMI in the same availability zone.  Those instances have all gone bad or go bad doing relatively normal tasks (mounting the instance storage and attempting to write files, cfdisk / format / mount instance store, md raid instance stores).  Please do not just reboot this instance.  Edited by: ""gary@dls.net"" on Apr 11, 2012 12:29 PM"
37232,Amazon EC2 V1,"Ok, it just became (more) responsive... seems intermittent."
37232,Amazon EC2 V1,"Same here. In us-east-1a. Database server has been wreaking havoc on our webapps because of intermittent sluggishness (sometimes complete non-responsiveness), which appears to be network related. I thought it might be our db, but sometimes when I try to SSH in, I can see the culprit being the network.  Nothing of interest in syslogs. Only the db logs show query connection timeouts.  i-43f9d520  Should I start to consider a relaunch? (I'd rather not, but you do what you have to do).  Thanks."
37232,Amazon EC2 V1,"dwsys,  I'm sorry that you're experiencing the same set of problems that I am, but part of me feels better knowing that it's not just me.  I hope Amazon can resolve our problems soon."
37232,Amazon EC2 V1,"Experiencing the same thing, I thought I'm the only one who experienced this.  Since this morning I had the same issue, I thought it was my DB who seats in EC2 and has EBS Volume attached.  But when I get into the SSH and investigate the logs, and boom blame it to the network.  Amazon need more explanation on this, please..."
37232,Amazon EC2 V1,"I've got to think it's an underlying hardware issue, which is why I'm thinking about making a pre-emptive strike and launching a new instance and re-attaching the db ebs volume early in the morning before aws pulls the box out of the rack and forces me to do it anyway.  Unless they chime in first and say it's resolved or can be easily resolved...."
37232,Amazon EC2 V1,"I hear ya, but I've got better things to do than make new instances all the time.  Especially when my new instances are failing right away...  This instance is just under 3 months old."
37232,Amazon EC2 V1,"We are not aware of any issue generally affecting instance network performance.  We are looking at each if the reported problems and will try to help isolate the problems.  We will likely follow up via private message as we might need more information.  Edited by: ian@aws on Apr 11, 2012 5:39 PM"
37232,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi dwsys,gary@dls.net,    Can you please let us know if you are still seeing these issues?   Regards, Praveen"
37232,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi Praveen,  Yes, as of 6am EST, I am still seeing problems occurring overnight. I am about to take the front-end webapps that use this back-end database server offline, and launch a new db instance.   I've never seen errors like this, in or out of AWS environments. I suppose there is an outside chance this could be something wrong with the postgresql database or OS, but I doubt it because:  1) It suddenly started yesterday around 11am EST, and nothing had changed (not aptitude updates, etc. -- nothing). 2) When trying to diagnose yesterday, I frequently had very sluggish, or timing-out ssh connections when trying to shell in to this instance. This is why I think it's underlying physical/network related.  The client errors we have been seeing have been a mix of:    could not connect to server: Connection timed out    SSL connection has been closed unexpectedly    SSL error: block type is not 01    SSL error: wrong tag     SSL error: bad signature    SSL error: decryption failed or bad record mac  And on the server, a mix of:    2012-04-12 06:00:50 UTC LOG:  could not accept SSL connection: tlsv1 alert decrypt error    2012-04-12 06:29:05 UTC LOG:  could not accept SSL connection: EOF detected    2012-04-12 06:41:15 UTC LOG:  could not receive data from client: Connection reset by peer    2012-04-12 06:51:28 UTC LOG:  could not accept SSL connection: tlsv1 alert decrypt error  As I said, I need to launch a new instance, or our clients will be ripping us new one today if this continues. If you still want to investigate, the instance id is in usa-east-1a:   i-43f9d520"
37232,Amazon EC2 V1,I'm seeing a few massive spikes on your network graph - both inbound and outbound. Is it possible that something running on your instance is causing this? The times I can see this are approximately 11:30am GMT yesterday and 01:30 GMT this morning.
37232,Amazon EC2 V1,"I haven't ruled entirely ruled out a problem with one of the webapps or the common database instance yet. However, the webapps are spread across other multiple instances, and some connect to this database instance, some to others. The common denominator is that all webapps that have their database shared on this instance are the ones having issues. Also, if it was one of the webapps, I would think it would impact other webapps and database instances.  If I see these problems after launching a new instance for this database server, then I'll start to suspect a rogue webapp.  Is there a way to tell if the new instance I launch somehow winds up on the underlying hardware as this instance that is causing problems? I don't think this is likely, but I have no idea how you guys manage that, and would hate to think a new us-east-1a instance ends up on the same hardware."
37232,Amazon EC2 V1,"The chances of this happening are very close to nil, but I can confirm for you if you can give me both instance IDs."
37232,Amazon EC2 V1,"BTW, I just finished a replacement instance, and so far, so good, no issues.   I checked the network spikes you referred to -- I checked the cloudwatch metrics on that instance -- if you are referring to Max Network In and Out, and it actually looks low compared to other of my database instances, some of which are even more heavily loaded.  The the ""spikes"" that I see appear to be about the times we do scheduled database backups, so this is very normal.  I'll leave this instance (i-43f9d520) running for a few more hours in case AWS wants to investigate -- I would be curious if it was hardware related in some way to something out of my control. But I'll probably shut it off this afternoon at the latest so we aren't being charged.  Edited by: dwsys on Apr 12, 2012 4:48 AM"
37232,Amazon EC2 V1,"Also -- the new instance ID is      i-669b2401  Again, the old instance that was causing problems is       i-43f9d520  If somehow the new instance ended up on the same hardware, please let me know.  Thanks for following up on this! I'm very curious to learn what happened, and also to determine if it was something that was or was not out of my control."
37232,Amazon EC2 V1,"I can confirm that these instances are not on the same hardware.  As far as we can see the underlying hardware on your original instance is actually okay, so I'm not sure what the difference would be in this case.  Sorry I can't give better guidance here."
37232,Amazon EC2 V1,"Ok, thanks for confirming the new instance is  on new hardware.  It sounds like this one is going to remain a mystery unless we start seeing problems on the newly launched instance again, so we'll consider this closed but unsolved.   I'm going to terminate the old instance so we don't accrue charges there.  Thanks for checking."
37232,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi,  I wanted to follow up to see how things are going with your new instance. Is the issue still present?   Regards, Zach"
37232,Amazon EC2 V1,"New instance is still going strong, no problems at all.  So something strange was going on with the old instance.   If it wasn't underlying hardware or something AWS-related out of my control, then the only thing I can think of is something went haywire in either the OS level or the Postgresql database software. But I can't think of what, and  syslog, dmesg, etc. and postgresql logs all were clean (except for the network errors popping up in the postgresql logs)."
37231,Amazon EC2 V1,"rpmdb problem The other day I ran yum update (when I ssh'd into my instance I saw I had updates to be applied), and got some ""out of memory"" errors.

37228,Amazon EC2 V1,"Can anonyone help asap, PLEASE???"
37228,Amazon EC2 V1,Looking at this now. Give me a few minutes.
37228,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi,  I'm afraid that it looks like this instance is failing to complete the boot process. This is not a fault with the underlying hardware; it is internal to your instance.  I'm afraid that troubleshooting this is not going to be easy. There are a few possible options for you which I'm going to list with the easiest choice first:  a) Just in case it is to do with resources (I don't think it is, but just in case) I'd consider upgrading your instance to a larger size - say m1.large - to see if this helps. To do this, do a Stop, a Change Instance Type, and a Start again.  b) If you have the facility to restore the instance to a snapshot taken before this problem occurred than that might be an option.  c) If you have a backup domain controller on the same domain, then I would be inclined to launch a replacement instance and work through Microsoft's procedures for decommissioning a failed domain controller.  d) If that is not possible, then the only other alternative is to attach your volume to a replacement Windows instance and analyse the Windows event logs and fix the issue using offline tools. It is impossible for me to write detailed instructions for this route I'm afraid, because every issue is different.  Hope this is some help."
37228,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi Richard,  I now receive pings from the instance.  Here's what I did: I changed the instance to m1.large.  Restarted but no solution. I stopped the instance, attached a new network interface and added a elastic IP to this interface.  After that I started the instance and the ping was back. What can I do to avoid problems like these?  Do I have to configure the network interface of the domain controller as DHCP?"
37228,Amazon EC2 V1,"That was a nice bit of lateral thinking; well done!  I didn't think of trying to attach a second network interface. I need my morning coffee.  As your instance is in a VPC you should be able to use a static IP without issue.  I wonder if the problem might be that the static address you're trying to use is one of the five reserved by Amazon -- as per our FAQ, we the first four IPs and the last IP in every subnet for networking purposes:  http://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/#I8  Can you advise?"
37228,Amazon EC2 V1,I saw also that the hostname of the windows server changed to what it was default.  I changed back and rebooted and know the instance is again unreachable (!?). I use 10.100.201.20 as the private ip of this instance.
37228,Amazon EC2 V1,"I did the trick again, and doing that the instance is again reachable.  This is not normal behaviour I guess.  I cannot reboot the server without having to worry that it won't go up again. Again the hostname changed to ip-0A64C914.  What is happening ??  How can the hostname be changed without me doing something like that?  Please advise"
37228,Amazon EC2 V1,"The host name change is performed by the Ec2ConfigService.  To turn this off, go to Start->All Programs->Ec2ConfigService Settings and turn off the check box under Set Computer Name."
37228,Amazon EC2 V1,"OK, will do that.  So that solves this problem.  But what about when rebooting without the extra NIC added, it goes into error.  So my idea is that that server can only boot if the extra NIC is attached.  The NIC however is not used for routing, I guess."
37228,Amazon EC2 V1,"Is this still happening to you after turning off the renaming function?  I will need to construct a test environment on our side in order to reproduce this, so just so I understand fully - you have a 2008 DC configured with a static IP of 10.100.201.20 and it will not boot fully unless you have a second network interface attached.   Have I missed anything?"
37228,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi Richard,  I got some work for you.  Apparently after exhaustive testing the instance i-048d7350 will only boot succesfully if network interface eni-dc8422b5 is attached. I believe this network interface was attached when I created the instance originally.  Now, I have no further need for this network interface, so I removed it.  Apparently this caused the reason why that server didn't booted anymore.  Can you explain that please?  Is it possible someway to detach this network interface?"
37228,Amazon EC2 V1,"Just saw your answer ... Yes, it happens still after doing the name change.  It only boots succesfully if that particular network interface is attached to the instance. Thanks for helping me on this issue."
37228,Amazon EC2 V1,"This is a bizarre issue, and not one that I can easily explain.  I am going to reconstruct your environment in my own AWS account to see if I can reproduce. Update to follow."
37228,Amazon EC2 V1,"If you need any information, do not hesitate to contact me.  You can also contact me directly on wouter.bruggemanatbintg.com. Thanks Richard for looking into this."
37228,Amazon EC2 V1,"I have been investigating possible scenarios here and I think I understand what your issue might be. In order to assign a static IP to a VPC instance you need to do this when the instance is first launched. I think what may have happened here is that you may have created your instance initially with a DHCP network interface and the system is expecting that, and therefore will not start without it.  I think your workaround of using the second network interface will solve your problem and there is no particular issue with leaving things this way. However, if you want to resolve properly you will need to launch a new instance using the Classic Wizard - then, when you launch within VPC, you can specify the static IP address you wish to use.  Does that answer your question? Apologies for the back and forth on this."
37228,Amazon EC2 V1,"I will just leave the extra NIC.  I disabled it in Windows so it can't do any harm.  OK Richard, we leave it like that and consider it solved.  Thanks for working with me on this issue and have a nice weekend!  Regards, Wouter"

37227,Amazon EC2 V1,"Snipi -- as this is an instance store instance, it would be necessary for you to fail away by launching a replacement from a known good backup. While EBS backed instances would allow you to stop/start to migrate to new hardware, best practice continues to be able to launch replacements instead of relying on a single instance.   jowierun -- is it the system status check or instance status check? If it is the instance status check, this is indicative of an issue internal to the instance configuration causing your reachability issue. Further information on status checks are available here: http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-system-instance-status-check.html  Regards, Zach"
37227,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hello Zach.  Thanks for your assistance.   I gather it is both types of Status checks - the ""Status Checks"" column in the AWS Console is showing two categories of message:  1) 0/2 checks passed   (tool tip: Instance reachability check failed.  System reachability check failed) 2) 1/2 checks passed   (tool tip: Instance reachability check failed).  These are instances launched from an AMI image.  When I choose type SMALL instead of MICRO the instance works ok.  Perhaps it is because I created the AMI image from a SMALL instance?  I have been using small and micro interchangeably in the past..."

37222,Amazon EC2 V1,Hi there can you confirm the instance id so that we can examine it to see if there are any  underlying hardware issues impacting on your instance.  Can you tell us any more about this instance such as the software stack and application suite you have installed in this instance.  Thanks JasonM
37222,Amazon EC2 V1,I apologize for the delay.   I totally forgot about this.  Here's our instance id for the crashing instance: i-c57a4aa9  It's been happening more and more and actually happened today twice.  I can give you exact times from our logs if that helps.
37222,Amazon EC2 V1,Here's the AMI ID ami-d9e40db0
37222,Amazon EC2 V1,I have just looked at this for you and cannot see any explanation on our side for this crashing. I think the problem may be internal to your instance. The next step will probably be to evaluate the event logs on the instance.
37222,Amazon EC2 V1,I had a feeling you were going to say that.  I'll dig further and see what we can find.  Thanks fo checking.
37222,Amazon EC2 V1,No problem. Let me know if you need anything else.
37222,Amazon EC2 V1,Everything we've found so far points to the host.  Is there anyway to move this instance to another host just to see if that'll fix it?
37222,Amazon EC2 V1,As this is an EBS backed instance you can move to a different physical host without data loss by stopping your instance in the AWS console and then starting it again.

37220,Amazon EC2 V1,"Issues while importing custom VMware with AWS import connector Hey guys,  for a few days now I'm trying to import a VMware ESX image to EC2 cloud using Amazon's import connector, version 1.1.0 . I had no problems with installing and registering the connector VM.  I tried a few times to import a custom Windows Server 08 R2 x32 VM with a single disk of 40 GB. But the import hangs after conversion at 3% . Later on I found the console throwing a message:  connector kernel: pid 5881 (dd), uid 2 inumber 117776 on /var: filesystem full connector kernel: pid 773 (dd), uid 0 inumber 70671 on /var: filesystem full  I reinstalled the connector using thick instead of thin provisioning. I thought the coinnector's disk space might be running out of free space. The newly configured connector has a thick provisioned 250 GB disk. Now the import fails at 1% .  There are no additional error messages, after one or two days of importing process hanging at 1% I canceled upload.  Can you guys help me to figure out there the error is located at?  Thanks!"
37220,Amazon EC2 V1,"I also tried with another VM. There the process failed at 10%, with the same error. I completely followed the guide for the import connector.  Are there any other best practises to prepare VMs for import?"
37220,Amazon EC2 V1,"That message leads me to believe that there are several log files in /var that may be taking up too much disk space.  These instructions assume a basic knowledge of how to move around in a Unix command line shell.  Let us know if you need further instruction.  First, connect to the Console of the Connector and log in as root (no password).    Then run this command to determine which directory under /var is using the most disk space:  du -sk /var/*   You'll see output that looks like this: 2       /var/account 6       /var/at [...] 9842    /var/log 10356   /var/tmp   Likely you'll see that /var/log is probably too large.  You can see how big and how full the /var partition is as well using the df command:  # df -k /var Filesystem 1024-blocks     Used Available Capacity  Mounted on /dev/disk1     1251790    14498   1137150     1%    /var   I'll assume for now that the problem lives in the /var/log/ directory, that maybe the frontend.log or poller.log have grown or been rotated several times.  Though this information is useful for debugging, obviously it's causing issues.  You can delete any log files that include a index, such as frontend.log.0.gz.  To delete files run this command:  rm -rf /var/log/frontend.log.0.gz   If you just want to do a directory listing and show the 10 largest files:  ls -la /var/log/ | sort -nk5 | tail -10   Cleaning out some disk space in the /var directory should resolve this error message.  I will ensure that not allowing the /var partition to be filled up be added to our feature list for a future version of the Connector -- sorry about that!  Pedro EC2 VM Import"
37220,Amazon EC2 V1,"Thanks Pedro,  but this did not solve my problem. I cleaned up all rotated log files as you showed me, but the error still appears on uploadin my custom VM. The upload process hangs, my VM is never uploaded.  So what do I have to do, to get rid of that error?  Do I have to extend the log partition or some other Linux magic? - I can't believe that I got more logs here than data to import.  VM has a size of 40 GB, connector has a disk of 250 GB and it was a clean installation."
37220,Amazon EC2 V1,"I'm very sorry that you are having this problem!  First, run this command and include it in this thread:  df -k   It will output all the filesystems mounted and the disk space used.  If /var shows 100%, it will confirm the error messages.  Next, run this command and include the output here:  du -sk /var/* | sort -n   This will output all files and directories in /var and how much disk space each are using.  It will help find the file or directory that is using up all the space in /var so we can figure out how to resolve the issue.  Also, please ensure that your VMware installation has enough disk space to allow for the Connector's 250GB.  It's unlikely the problem, but worth confirming.  Thanks for your patience while we figure out what's wrong and how to fix it.  Pedro EC2 VM Import Amazon Web Services"
37220,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi Pedro,  thanks for your time.  df -k show that  /var has 109% /dev has 100% /dev/fd has 100%  of usage.

37220,Amazon EC2 V1,"It looks like the /var partition is no longer at 100%, which should eliminate the problem you first identified.  Based on the output you attached, and the parameters for the VM you are importing, the Connector and your task should be good to go.    If you still have problems, and /var fills up again before the task completes, please run ""du -sk /var/*"" again, then cd to the largest directory and run ""ls -la"" in that directory and post it here.  Hopefully your issue is resolved!  Let us know either way.  Pedro EC2 VM Import Amazon Web Services"
37220,Amazon EC2 V1,"Atm the import is at 33 % and there are nor messages displayed in console yet. On monday I might say for sure if VM has been imported successfully.

37220,Amazon EC2 V1,Since two days the import hangs at 33%. There are no related outputs in console.  Attached there are the outputs of your commands. Dev is at 100% capacity.  Do we have other possibilities of importing a custom VM to AWS?
37220,Amazon EC2 V1,"The /dev and /dev/fd filesystems are device filesystems.  Since it does not represent any physical or virtual blocks on a disk, df will always report it as 100%.  This does not negatively impact the Connector.  From the man page for devfs(5): The device file system, or devfs, provides access to kernel's device namespace in the global file system namespace.  The conventional mount point is /dev. Â  The file system includes several directories, links, symbolic links and devices, some of which can also be written.

37220,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi Pedro,  did you receive our debug logs? - Do you already have some useful hints for me?  Best regards"
37220,Amazon EC2 V1,"Thank you for sending the log.   The upload hang was because the thread that uploads the VMDK threw a unexpected exception and became defunct when uploading the VMDK to S3 (The error is in poller.log).   Since the task import-i-ffxwy*** has expired, it's better to restart the import. It is easy to do so by using the command line tool ""ec2-import-instance"" and specify the manifest URL.  The command details could be found here http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/CommandLineReference/ApiReference-cmd-ImportInstance.html  The specific command line options in your case is  `ec2-import-instance path-to-vmdk-on-local-disk  -t c1.medium -f VMDK -o aws-access-key -w aws-secret-key --manifest-url manifest-url --region eu-west-1`  In the above, aws-access-key and aws-secret-key are your AWS security credentials.

37220,Amazon EC2 V1,"Thanks for your investigations, but I'm not sure if I understand the result, sorry.  Where is the error located? - Is it locally in my connector VM?

""If you would like to startover the whole import with the connector, you could cleanup all the ongoing tasks for the virtual machine you want to import...""

How can I manage that? - Last time I installed connector from scratch, redownloaded it from AWS, followed the guide of Amazon to get it installed and configured to use in vSphere. There are no customizations done. I didn't install the connector to a 'directory', cause I just used the *.ovf template to import connector. It is now located as a VM on a datastore with ~0,8 TB free disk space.  Edited by: wewebu on Apr 3, 2012 7:14 AM"
37220,Amazon EC2 V1,"Sorry I didn't make the steps to start over a new import clearly.  1. `df -h /var` to make sure there is enough available spaces in /var. If there is not enough space, please remove the rotated logs in /var/log. Their names look like frontend.log.<number>.gz or maybe web-frontend.log.<number>.gz  2. `cd /usr/local/amazon-connector/VMDKs` to change to the directory where all the VMDKs are exported. You probably will see two VMDKs there. One is named 1.vmdk the other is named 2.vmdk.  3. Remove these two VMDKs since we are going to start over the process.  4. Start the new import.  To monitor the import process:  `cd /usr/local/amazon-connector` and then `tail -f poller.log`. As the import process goes on, you could see the detailed log display on the screen.  Please let me know if it still has problem. Shuai"

37220,Amazon EC2 V1,Okay guys. Now it is stuck at 19%. And I got a new error message here. See atachement for details.
37220,Amazon EC2 V1,I send my debug logs again to the given adress.
37220,Amazon EC2 V1,"This looks like your Internet connection is to blame.  What is the upload capacity of your Internet connection?  On Apr 10, 2012 2:44 AM you said you were at 19%.  Right now you are at 29.3% uploaded.  It is possible that the Connector has either given up or is unable to continue uploading.  You are trying to upload a 50GB file.  With 1Mbps upload bandwidth, the upload would take almost 6 days.    The ""Broken pipe"" in your last screenshot indicates that the connection between the Connector and S3 was disrupted.  This does happen, but if it happens often it can mean that we have to repeatedly attempt the upload of the pieces of your Virtual Machine.    At this point I would suggest moving to using the CLI tools to try your import.  You can read how to do this here:  http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/UploadingYourInstancesandVolumes.html#ExportingYourVMVMware  If the upload fails, you can resume it using ec2-resume-import.  Before doing that, please let me know what your upload connection speed is to S3/EC2/AWS, as it may simply be inadvisable to try to upload 50GB using your current Internet Connection.  Pedro EC2 VM Import Amazon Web Services"
37220,Amazon EC2 V1,This sounds logically. I told our GW to force the import connector to use another line which is a syncrhon 10 Mbit line. So this should solve this (hopefully) last issue.

37214,Amazon EC2 V1,"Beginner Questions I just set up a free EC2 instance of Amazon's AMI to run a Minecraft server. I have it working but I have a few general questions about EC2:  How many free instances can you have under one account? If I keep making instances just to play around do I have to worry about getting charged?  If you start out with a free instance, are there any settings that could accidentally be enabled that I could be charged for when all I am running are free instances?  What other cool things have people used the free EC2 servers for? (i.e., cool projects that actually run well with the limited resources of the free instance)"
37214,Amazon EC2 V1,"In general, you might want to keep an eye on the Account Activity. It is not real-time data, but the information is updated quite frequently. You will be able to run one Windows instance, and one Linux instance. Note that the free tier covers Micro instances only. You will be charged if you exceed the free tier limits. This applies not only to the number of instances (more specifically, total instance hours), but also things like disk operations, data transfer, and unused static IP addresses (called Elastic IP). The Account Activity allows you to catch any unwanted charges early on."

37212,Amazon EC2 V1,"Ahmed,  It is now fully back up. I am maddened by a few things:  1. Why was the instance unreachable? I didn't change a thing, and server is coasting pretty smoothly with just apache, php, and mysql. Hard drive is 30% full and I'm not pushing the memory boundaries.  2. Why aren't there logs for AWS? I realize I have to pay to get monitoring, but AWS should at least leave a log as to why things happened, so I can prevent or plan for them in the future.  I realize AWS is a cheap service, but it is getting really frustrating with extended amounts of downtime between the system error a few days back and random unreachable moments like tonight.  Thanks, Keehun"
37212,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi Keehun,  1) I'm afraid my tools don't give me anything that can help you here; as far as I can see your instance was up and running until it was stopped via a requested shutdown at 05:05 GMT this morning (roughly two hours prior to this post). I see it was restarted shortly afterwards and that it has been running since.  2) AWS does not have any visibility whatsoever of the internals of your instance, such as logs generated by the operating system you are running and similar. What we can see is the state of the virtual machine and a time line showing its status. We can also view statistics on the underlying hardware and the console output (if any) from your instance. Unfortunately this information is not sufficient to diagnose what happened in your case.  I would suggest the following basic troubleshooting steps the next time your instance is unreachable:  a) Generate a traceroute to it to eliminate the network as a cause. Similarly, attempt to log into it from somewhere else if that is an option.  b) Review the Cloudwatch metrics at the time to see if any of the graphs indicate a problem (such as maximum CPU).  c) If all else fails, once the instance is reachable again, view /var/log (Linux) or Event Viewer (Windows) to see if you can identify what might have prevented access during that time.  Sorry I can't be more help."

It turns out that JRE/JDK 7 packages are not available for Ubuntu 10.x, or at least not out of the box.  I terminated the above and started again with a micro Ubuntu 11.x and I'm hoping I won't need need any developer tools on my AMI so have used:   sudo apt-get update  sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre  It gets someway through installing Java 7 and then freezes with 100% CPU utilization.  Has anyone got it to work?"
37201,Amazon EC2 V1,This is a  known issue. The workaround is to install java while the instance is anything but a micro and then downgrade it to a micro after installation.
37201,Amazon EC2 V1,"I checked the link you posted.  They are mostly discussing older versions of Ubuntu (such as the one I had installed JDK+JRE on) so I'm not confident the link it relevant.  Furthermore, I rebooted the hung Ubuntu 11.10 32bit and Java seems to have installed. There is a possibility that my install is corrupted but it does not seem half as bad as the instability reported on the external link. So for now, I think the commands in my opening post are the better approach (just let it hang, go for lunch, then reboot it).  The only instability I have had is when JVM naively launched my application, then died with        ""Out of memory error, Java heap space"".  Using 'top' I can see the memory usage does not change significantly. It reads as 420868k free at the time the Exception is thrown.  I assume this is the instability issue reported on the external link for people who have resized from small to micro AMI?  Edit (fixed):  It looks like AWS Ubuntu 11.10 micro AMI has its maximum JVM memory set to 61.3Mb instead of the advertised 613Mb.  The workaround is to add the switch -Xms000m where 000 is the number of Mb the application needs on the heap.  If you go above the VM limit, the application is not swapped to the 8Gb ECB and will be abruptly killed.  My application is (by design) somewhat of a memory hog. It needed 703Mb minimum and the lack of swapping was - and maybe still is - annoying. I have space optimized my code a bit and now everything is working   Edited by: Wibbler on Apr 12, 2012 3:52 PM"

37196,Amazon EC2 V1,"Shutdown on Alarm & More Questions Greeting Community!  I have several questions as I am completely new to Amazon Cloud Computing and am trying to determine if this service is going to suite our needs.  First, we are looking to use this for a online course we run where students can each have their own machine with our software installed.  Most of these students won't be using the machines except for once or twice a week and some may use them more.  What we don't want to run into is someone leaving their machine on everyday and not using it and racking up a large bill for no reason.  However, the installed programs and their data needs to remain in tact during the duration of the course.  So here are my questions:  1.  What service do I need for the virtual machine?  Instance, Spot Instance or Reserved Instance? 2.  Can we setup an alarm/action to monitor the instance that if it is not being used (similar to a screensaver being enabled) after x amount of time that it will shutdown the computer so we are not being billed for the unused time?  And when the end user needs it again it can be restarted at their will?  Thanks in advance for your assistance!  Steve"
37196,Amazon EC2 V1,"NeuroDimension, Inc. wrote: 1.  What service do I need for the virtual machine?  Instance, Spot Instance or Reserved Instance?  I believe you might be interested in using on-demand instances. An on-demand instance backed by Elastic Block Store (EBS) can be stopped and started as required. When an instance is stopped, you pay for storage only. Note that the static IP address (if any) will be detached from the instance. When you leave an Elastic IP unused, you will be charged a small hourly fee. It needs to be attached manually after the instance has launched. However, instances running in VPC keep the Elastic IP address even when stopped. As far as I know, it is still considered to be attached, which means you won't be charged.  You can optionally purchase instance reservations. This is just a billing feature which won't affect your on-demand instances in any way. As all instances might not be running at the same time, you might want to purchase fewer reservations. Because the instances will be used occasionally, you need to do the math to find out if on-demand on reserved is your best bet.  Spot instances use a bidding system, and they will be terminated if the spot market price exceeds your bid. You probably don't want to lose instances just like that.  2.  Can we setup an alarm/action to monitor the instance that if it is not being used (similar to a screensaver being enabled) after x amount of time that it will shutdown the computer so we are not being billed for the unused time?  And when the end user needs it again it can be restarted at their will?  The EC2 API allows you to perform actions such as stopping or starting an instance. This can be integrated with any internal system you might have. That would make it possible for the user to stop/start his instance.  I believe the tricky part here is to figure out whether an instance is in use or not. Maybe you can have a script on the instance, which somehow determines if there is a user interacting with your application. You probably want to build your own image anyway, which means it would be simple to include this check. When you use your own image, any instance launched based on it will have all software installed out of the box.  However, that means each instance might need access to AWS credentials. You can create a separate set of credentials granting access to stop/start only. Users would be able to stop/start any instance in your account, but they won't be allowed to do any real damage. As an alternative, you could have the script notify some central server, which in turn performs the stop operation. If you provide each instance with some sort of simple authentication key, users wouldn't be able to request other instances to be stopped. When an instance is launched for the first time, this little secret value can be submitted to the instance as user data input.  Well, I'm just brainstorming..."

37194,Amazon EC2 V1,"Thanks for following up. I've taken a look at the EBS volumes in question and can confirm there are no existing hardware issue.   What may be worth looking into at this point, as I see you have several snapshots of this volume, is to create a new volume from one (or several) of the snapshots and see if any of them contain previous versions of your data.   It is worth mentioning the 400GB ephemeral store you're seeing and have successfully mounted. This is storage local to the hardware your instance resides on. For the previous instance type you were running (m1.large) there are 2x420GB ephemeral stores. When you stop and start an instance, it migrates to new hardware, and thus you lose any data residing on these ephemeral stores.   Is there any chance you were using this ephemeral storage for your data?  Further information on instance types/associated storage: http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/index.html?instance-types.html  Further information on ephemeral ""instance"" storage: http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html  Regards, Zach"
37194,Amazon EC2 V1,"Thanks for the info Zach, I was unaware of the ephemeral stores included in the large instances.  I did try to recreate a new volume from our snapshot but ran into the same problem when trying to mount the attached EBS. Is there a way to view the content of the snapshot itself?"
37194,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi,  The only method to view snapshot content is by creating an EBS volume from it. The messaging of no file system existing occurs when you create a brand new volume, and is part of why I was thinking there was a chance you were mistakenly using instance storage in the past for your production data while believing it was actually the EBS volume you are now attempting to mount.  Regards, Zach"
37194,Amazon EC2 V1,I am very sure we were using EBS volume as a couple of months ago we created additional instances and I attached the existing EBS volume over to the new instances.   What's worrying me is that I just created volumes from old snapshots as far back as last year and they seem to be empty. I have created volumes from these snapshots before without problems.

37191,Amazon EC2 V1,"Java unable to resolve localhost on Debian 6 AMI I'm looking for help on a problem that we've been having with our Java runtime being unable to properly resolve the localhost through the InetAddress.getLocalHost()   method. We ran into this when moving to a Debian 6.0.4 (Squeeze) AMI from a Debian 5 (Lenny) instance.  Initially we saw it manifested through many Javamail failures, which looked like this:  Exception in thread ""main"" org.springframework.mail.MailSendException: Mail server connection failed; nested exception is javax.mail.MessagingException: 501 Syntax: HELO <hostname>  A little investigation indicated that this was a result of the underlying Java call InetAddress.getLocalHost()  throwing an exception which didn't occur on the Debian 5 server. We searched around through a bunch of different sources, which all seem to indicate something about the name service being configured incorrectly, but we haven't been able to correct the configuration, as the OS seems to be resolving localhost correctly. Also, we were initially running the code in a Tomcat application server, but a little more investigation revealed that the behavior was the same outside of the app server.  We know that we can correct the specific Javamail issue by updating the javamail library that we are using, but we're still concerned about this underlying issue.  Has anyone seen anything like this, or have any insight into how we can resolve this problem? I'll put a few of the links that we went through to try to resolve the issue.

37184,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi Jeff,  I think that your ELB (the load balancer) is only sending the traffic to one of your instances (the bdb15fa) because only that instance CPU load is increasing to a point which it gets overloaded and cannot answer to requests anymore.  Do you have ""stickiness"" enabled in your ELB? You can check that from the EC2 console, in ""Load balancers"", then by clicking on ""edit"" next to the ""Port Configuration"" setting of your ELB.  If you have it enabled and that you that don't need session stickiness, disable it. In normal circumstances (where real users connect to your website), they each get assigned with a cookie by the ELB, which indicates to what instance route the request to.  And I think that in the case of loadstorm.com, the ELB assigns them the same cookie, hence the routing to the same instance.  Hope this helps!!!  Chris."

37182,Amazon EC2 V1,"N. Virginia (us-east-1a) network performance, wowza media server Hi there everybody.  I have a small ec2 instance running wowza media server 2.2.3., in the N. Virginia zone. It serves a live flash audio stream that has: Intermittent 30-60 second bursts, every 5 to 10 minutes, 6am-6pm EST, Monday-Friday.  It has been running now for about a year (current uptime is 120 days) with no trouble. Fantastic! However just recently, at the end of last week, we've started to notice some trouble.  My customers are reporting (and I can hear over the phone) that our audio is choppy/stuttering. The issue has been observed cross platform, cross browser, cross plug-in (adobe vs. chrome). After exhausting every possible end user troubleshooting we are now looking to our server.  Being a small instance I was concerned about Processor and Memory Resources but after watching it all day, I can see that we are only using half the memory we have available and intermittently 5% of the cpu.   Since it's aws, we assumed that bandwidth usage isn't an issue, however since both origin and end user seems to be clear of issues, it really seems like it may be a 'network' issue. The choppy audio originally made us think that anyway.  I spoke with someone at amazon and they pointed out the event last week on April 6th in the N. Virginia zone, that has caused some network issues. So that encouraged me to see if this community has also noticed any similar network issues, and might have some good advice in handling it. It really seems like this is most likely the cause due to the timelyness and history etc.  Also given the nature of our content and it's distribution, our bandwidth usage is not as steady as many others. In terms of monthly bandwidth usage our total is rather low, but since we are streaming the audio to a dozens and dozens of users in real time (we have wowza configured for the least latency) our bandwidth usage is obviously characterized by spikes.   SO... given that, the amazon agent suggested that we may be running on hardware that may be hosting other servers that are using enough of the bandwidth on that device that it doesn't allow our usage to spike as we need. Of course he suggested simply restarting the instance will put it on different hardware which will likely have a different usage pattern... this seemed like it was probably not the cause of the issue, but is certainly something to be aware of. I hope I don't have to go dedicated for this.  So anyway, if you made it this far through my way-too-long explanation, I hope you can leave me any encouraging thoughts you might have   Thanks!

37180,Amazon EC2 V1,"AWS console feature-request - browser title prefixed with context I'm not really sure if this is the right forum to ask, but I didn't see one for specifically the AWS Console. (Is there one?)  At present, the AWS Console's HTML title is ""AWS Management Console"" regardless of which tab inside the console is open.  I often run a browser with many AWS console tabs open at once; I'd find it very useful if the title could be prefixed with the tab-name of the open console tab - and preferably also the sub-section if there is one.  For example, if I'm looking at VPC routing tables, I'd want it to read similar to ""Route tables | VPCs | AWS Management Console"" (that is, from most specific to least specific).  I'd then be able to tell at more of a glance which tab was which.  I'd also be more than happy for it to not have the ""AWS Management Console"" text in it at all, if it could have a different favicon from the forums (etc)."

Unfortunately I am not able to connect to it either, and based on your description it seems like you have managed to lock yourself out via the Windows Firewall.   At this point you have two choices. The easiest solution is to launch a replacement instance, and migrate data by hand by attaching your existing EBS volume to the new one. The more complicated solution involves attaching the existing EBS volume to a replacement instance and using tools to modify the Windows Registry.  The key that you need is as follows:  HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SharedAccess\Parameters\FirewallPolicy\StandardProfile"
37172,Amazon EC2 V1,"Dear Richard,  Ours was reserved instance brought last month and it costed $1200.

37172,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi Saravana,  The good news is that reservations are a billing concept only. Once the bad instance is terminated your reservation will automatically be applied to another instance of the same size within your account. Please see the following link which explains in more detail:  http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/reserved-instances/#5  In this case a snapshot is not going to help you unless you took one before the firewall changes. Your snapshot will have the same problem which is preventing you accessing the instance now.  Here are the steps you will need to resolve this issue:  1) Launch a new instance via the AWS console. You can do this easily by right-clicking on your existing instance and choosing the option ""Launch more like this"".  2) Stop your old instance (i-6400a306).   3) Go to EC2->Volumes. Right click on your old volume (vol-b1e99edc) and choose Detach Volume. Then right click it again and choose Attach Volume, choosing to link it to your new instance (as per step 1).  4) At this point you should have your old volume available on your new instance, and you can migrate data accordingly.  5) Once you are sure you have your data migrated correctly, you can terminate your old instance.  Please let me know if you need any more detail on this."

37172,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi Saravana,  Creating an AMI from your existing instance is not going to solve the problem, as it will have the same issue with the firewall that prevents you gaining access to the system.

The default index.html file might work just fine while the dynamic components just throw errors.  Try adding a trailing slash - ""/application/"" instead of ""/application"". If you are on Linux/Mac, use ""curl -v http://<instance>/<health check path>"" to see the response code and full headers. If you get a 301 or 302 code, have a look at the Location header.

37165,Amazon EC2 V1,"An AWS region contains two or more availability zones. Each zone is basically a separate datacenter, and provides low latency connectivity to all other zones in the region. Your resources, such as EC2 instances, reside in the region of your choice. The AWS regions are isolated from each other, but you can seamlessly manage resources in different availability zones within the same region.  Edge locations serve requests for CloudFront and Route 53. CloudFront is a content delivery network, while Route 53 is a DNS service. Requests going to either one of these services will be routed to the nearest edge location automatically. This allows for low latency no matter where the end user is located.  S3 stores your data in multiple availability zones within your region of choice. The US Standard region works a bit different though, as it uses both the East and West coast.  Charges depend on which services you are interested in. You mentioned S3, but posted this in the EC2 forum. Do you have any particular setup in mind? That would make it easier to give more specific information. The AWS cloud is huge, and there are a lot of different pricing schemes involved."

S3 stores your data in availability zones within the same region, except for US Standard which works a bit different. But in any case, the data is stored safely in multiple places. However, the data won't leave the S3 region of your choice. If you store data in EU West (Ireland), it will be kept in Ireland, and won't leave Europe by itself.  Availability zones are as independent as possible. If something happens to one of the zones, the remaining ones will remain unaffected. Unlike regions, they are located very close to each other. All availability zones in a region use the same internal network. You can expect low latency when communicating across zones."

37164,Amazon EC2 V1,"hello.  you will be paying 1$ for the storage + the I/O that you use, 1 million request to the EBS could be look like a lot, but please keep in mind that in a month there is a rough figure of 2.6 million of seconds, so 1 million I/O is accessing the storage every ""odd second"" for example (this are rough calculations so it is easier to explain).  If you are using the EBS volume as root volume for the instance, each time that the guest OS needs (for example) to read a lib, a binary, write in the log, etc. This will be considered a I/O. We cannot comment into how much I/O your instance will use because we don't have information about your user case.    Let me know if this answer your question"

37161,Amazon EC2 V1,"Static instance behind ELB + auto scaling group Hello, we would like to have one instance always running behind our ELB and then using autoscaling to add more when load is high.  Only using autoscaling our problem is that oldest instances are removed, and we would like the opposite.   When adding one server manually to the ELB and have the autoscaling group added as well, but with min size set to 0 (and desired-capacity to 0 as well) - autoscaling ins't happening.  How can we have the autoscaling group triggered on metrics from our manually added server? Even with 100% CPU load on our manually added server, the ELB says instance is healthy and autoscaling isn't happening.  Thanks, Martin"
37161,Amazon EC2 V1,"What does your CloudWatch alarms look like? This instance will live outside the Auto Scaling group, and might not be included in the metric you are currently using. That would be the case if it is aggregated by Auto Scaling group."

Can i somehow modify its behavior on when the ELB should start redirect traffic to another instance?  Thanks, Martin"
37161,Amazon EC2 V1,"livebloggen wrote: ... do I understand you correctly that I need to create a new cloudwatch alarm for my manually added instance...  I was thinking about another aggregated metric, possibly by AMI, but this can work as well. But if you choose this route, make sure to keep the Auto Scaling instances in mind. Scaling based on this single instance only might not work very well. But yes, you can probably combine two alarms - one for the first instance, and another one for average CPU utilization in the Auto Scaling group.  Another question, how does the ELB choose what instance to route traffic to?  The ELB will distribute incoming requests between the available backend instances. An instance will be considered healthy as long as the health checks succeed. Your application can decide that 100% CPU utilization is not very healthy, and return a non-200 OK response, but that will remove the instance from service entirely. You will want to scale out before you reach a degraded state."

The instances are not fronted by a load balancer    When an instance starts up, a script runs that creates custom CloudWatch metrics for the instance and then periodically submits data for these metrics to CloudWatch.  We could alarm on the INSUFFICIENT_DATA state for one of these metrics, but sometimes, the script fails to initialize in which case we don't have any metrics on which to check for INSUFFICIENT_DATA    I currently have an external script that periodically gets the list of instances in an autoscale group and determines if they are reporting custom metrics to CloudWatch.

Based on your health check, a health check is considered failed if after 3 seconds the Elastic Load Balancer does not receive a HTTP 200 response.

37132,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi,     The instance that you had this IP address associated is i-232fe54a. The instance was running on a host that was degraded. You were sent a notice to backup the data and terminate the instance on 12-December 2011.  Please remember that hardware failures can occur with any machine (inside or outside of Amazon EC2). The advantage of EC2 is it gives you all the tools necessary to quickly and easily move away from any single failing node. You may want to check out this section of the EC2 User Guide:  http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts-failure-resilient-apps.html  Because EC2 instances do not provide individual high availability, it is up to the customer to design a redundant deployment and/or create a disaster recovery plan for data and applications that they host with Amazon EC2.  When designing your application on EC2, it's important to create a fault-tolerant architecture that can survive the loss of any single instance. Because hardware failures happen in every computing environment and Amazon EC2 gives you all the tools you need to quickly replace any portion of your architecture, our general advice is to migrate away from any instance that begins to display unexpected behavior or becomes uncontactable.  Sorry for the inconvenience.  Regards, Praveen"

37131,Amazon EC2 V1,"With that many failures, I would start looking into issues with your application, stack or operating system. Instances do fail in AWS, and you should plan for it, but it does not fail that often.  Now there are scenarios where you could be exceeding the available resources on a given instance, which is causing processes to lock up, crash or become otherwise unresponsive.  You might be running into bugs with the operating system (I had a linux kernel issue that caused my instances to lock up as soon as they became heavily loaded)  You can start by looking at your cloudwatch stats and console logs to see if there is anything that might indicate what is going on."

AWS control panel showed it running normally but I could not contact it via elastic ip or public dns.  Since we publish using eclipse I had to stop it and publish again to get the server back up. Fortunately the new instance is running fine but the old instance is hung trying to shut down. The instance id is i-dd9e37b1.  There have been other posts like this today. Is this part of a larger issue and more importantly is it likely to happen again? This is a very serious issue for us - aws has been very reliable for our production instances up to now.

I have quite a few instances running RHEL5.7, 5.8. in production (VPC) and test environment that cannot perform a yum update and I was told by AWS support that because the original AMI that our EC2 instance is based off is RHEL-5.5-Starter-EBS-x86_64-Access. This particular AMI is no longer supported by Redhat for updates. The recommend steps outlined in the Redhat KB is to migrate to a newer version of the AMI that is supported.  However we have other EC2 instances that were build based off RHEL-5.5-Starter-EBS-x86_64-Access where yum update is working fine. Some instances required a reboot to fix yum issue.  So I have done some test in our test environment, us-east-1b AZ. I have tested launching a new instance from ami-22e9354b.

Is that simply because Oregon doesn't have as many connections into the general internet as Virginia?  What is the data pipe in Oregon like?

37111,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi Eric,  It sounds like you're referring to the EC2 CLI command ""ec2-import-instance"".

Use DescribeInstances to get the current state (Pending, Starting, Stopping, Running, Stopped, etc.) to ensure the instance exists and is in process of being created. 4.

37091,Amazon EC2 V1,"After use EBS Root Windows, where is the instance storage? I have created a ""Small Instance"" of Windows 2008 with EBS root. I see 30G disk there which I know it's EBS, since I see a volume in the EBS account.  But where is the ""160 GB instance storage"" specified by Amazon's Instance Type? It should not ""eat"" that free storage I can get just because of I used EBS as root, right?  BTW, when I created a Linux instance, I do see the instance storage there which mounted in /mnt if I use EBS as root."
37091,Amazon EC2 V1,"EBS storage is not instance storage. Most EBS backed instances do not have instance storage enabled by default, but it can be enabled using the -b option when launching an instance with the command line tools.  You need to be aware of the differences between EBS and instance storage. EBS storage is persistent and allows you to start/stop your instance. Instance storage is not persistent and will not survive if the instance crashes or is started/stopped."
37091,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi,   To set up an EC2 instance with ephemeral storage you will need to launch the instance using the EC2 API tools and specify the ephemeral storage during launch.  Information  on the EC2 tools can be found here:   http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/index.html?setting-up-your-tools.html  The syntax to run your instance with ephemeral storage would be similar to the following:   ec2-run-instances ami-{.....} -g {your-base-group} -k {your-keypair-name} -t m1.small -b ""xvdb=ephemeral0"" --debug"

37089,Amazon EC2 V1,"Cloud Watch Question Hi,  Would anyone know if an alarm set in Cloud Watch would still work if the instance became unavailable?

Any help provided is greatly appreciated.  Thanks."
37089,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi supersunnyonec2,  Sure! You can create a CloudWatch Alarm on one of the AWS/EC2 metrics and set it to email you if it goes into INSUFFICIENT_DATA state. I would create an alarm on a 10 minute period for CPUUtilization if you are using CloudWatch Basic (5 minute) metrics.   Let me know how this works,  -Mike"

Sendgrid is basically forcing us to prove the source of the hack and prove the source of the activity. (They can't even tell me which IP addresses the smtp connections were made from!)

37077,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi,       We've confirmed there was  a hardware issue i-18acbe73 with the physical host your instance is running on. You were sent notification to backup the data needed and terminate the instance on 12-December 2011.     Please remember that hardware failures can occur with any machine (inside or outside of Amazon EC2). The advantage of EC2 is it gives you all the tools necessary to quickly and easily move away from any single failing node. You may want to check out this section of the EC2 User Guide:   http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts-failure-resilient-apps.html       Because EC2 instances do not provide individual high availability, it is up to the customer to design a redundant deployment and/or create a disaster recovery plan for data and applications that they host with Amazon EC2.       When designing your application on EC2, it's important to create a fault-tolerant architecture that can survive the loss of any single instance. Because hardware failures happen in every computing environment and Amazon EC2 gives you all the tools you need to quickly replace any portion of your architecture, our general advice is to migrate away from any instance that begins to display unexpected behavior or becomes uncontactable.   Sorry for the inconvenience.   Regards, Praveen"

Is it possible to downgrade these to the Medium Utilization?  I didn't realize the change until I went to check out purchasing a High Utilization ElastiCache instance and saw a big red warning text that you would be charged whether using it or not.  At that point, I wondered if the EC2 instances were the same.  I would suggest that the AWS Console should give this same warning when purchasing EC2 Reserved Instances (it wasn't there when I purchased and doesn't warn you currently)  Davy"
37069,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hello Davey,  Per our EC2 pricing page; Heavy Utilization RIs are most appropriate for steady-state production workloads that will be always running, so you commit to the entire duration of the Reserved Instance term. With this RI, you pay a higher upfront payment than Medium Utilization RIs and the lowest hourly usage fee. Note that you are charged the low hourly rate for every hour of the Reserved Instance term you purchase, regardless of whether an applicable DB instance is running.   The terms of the instance purchases state that they are non-transferable and non-refundable.   You can find more information within the AWS Service Terms, http://aws.amazon.com/serviceterms/  Per our conversation, I have sent you an email to the address listed on your account.

37064,Amazon EC2 V1,"The Amazon Linux AMI now has two versions of MySQL available to use, 5.1 and 5.5. To achieve this we renamed the mysql packages to mysql51 and mysql55. The unversioned mysql package is now a metapackage which installs mysql55 by default. We only support running one version of MySQL at a time on an instance, however multiple versions of the client libraries can be installed.  To fix your problem you should first update your system to ensure you are using the new MySQL packages. This can be done by doing  yum clean all yum update   Once that is done you will still have MySQL 5.1 on your system. If you want MySQL 5.5 you must remove MySQL 5.1 first. This can be done by doing  yum remove mysql51-*   If you have an application linked against the MySQL 5.1 libraries you can still have mysql51-libs installed with MySQL 5.5. All packages in the Amazon Linux AMI have been recompiled against MySQL 5.5 so this is only needed if you have applications installed that are not from Amazon.

There are two short term solutions  1. Before you run yum install mysql run yum remove mysql* 2. Tell yum to install the mysql51 package instead of mysql  I am working on a solution to this issue and will reply when I have a fix.
37064,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hello - the actual command that you need to run to see what packages you have installed is yum list installed 'mysql*'   The additional packages that you have installed on the ami will show up with a @reponame tag instead of ""installed""  It looks like you have an older version of mysql-libs installed already, and based on thw way we set things up, yum is trying to avoid really hard upgrading that package to a mysql-5.5 based one.  There are two ways you can proceed:   if you are sure that nothing on your image requires the mysql-libs, you can yum erase mysql-libs  before attempting the yum install mysql    if you do have software that might depend on the older mysql5.1 libs, you can alter your mysql install to be yum install mysql mysql51-libs    Thank you for using Amazon Linux AMI!"

So, we are assuming that AWS actually did something to release the hung stopping status that we cannot do externally.  Can you confirm/deny/elaborate on that?"
37062,Amazon EC2 V1,"EC2 instance - What does ""Launch Similar"" do? What does ""Launch Similar"" do?  I had an instance running, and wanted to create a duplicate of it to try something out, so I thought Launch Similar would do that. But instead, it went back to an earlier image I made (not the latest image of that instance).  So now I'm just wondering about the logic behind this feature.  Thanks for any advice."
37062,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi,  Great question.  I believe you are referring to the the ""Launch More Like this"" option in the AWS Management Console.  This option takes the options used to launch the instance you are selecting and populates them for you in the launch wizard.  You are correct as it will launch the same base AMI that the instance you had selected used when it was launched.    If you would like to launch instances that have the same configuration, you will first need to create  create AMI of the instance and launch an additional instance from the new AMI.  Calin"

37060,Amazon EC2 V1,"Autoscaling triggers based on SQS Hi, I'm kind of new to Cloud Computing and I want to add autoscaling to my EC2 instances. I did some research but i couldn't find any good guidelines on wich metrics I should use.  Personally I had the following in mind: In my application the number of messages in the sqs queue should be maximum 1 at all times because I want fast service for my costumers. So I was thinking to add extra instances when ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible >1. (Is that a reliable metric or should i stick with the CPU usage metric?) But i guess I'm not able to scale down based on the ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible metric? Should I use the CPU usage metric for scaling down and what parameters should I use? (With parameters I mean after what amount of time should I add or disable how many instances?)  Is it possible to give me some guidelines on autoscaling and its metrics and parameters?   Thank you"

One side effect is that the apache mod_dir module is not working as expected.  When I try loading a URL that points to a directory like:  https://some.domain.com/dir  Apache is redirecting to:  http://some.domain.com/dir/  instead of:  https://some.domain.com/dir/  This is happening because the connection between ELB and the server is now plain http instead of https as it was before.

The next step is to asign a elastic ip on each network interface, when i do this only one elastic ip works. The second interface that have the second elastic ip dont work.  If i do a ""ping -I eth0 www.google.es"" googles respond to the ping and works but when i do ""ping -I eth1 www.google.es"" i get the ip address but not response to ping so the packet lost are losing.  Maybe the ping cant come back, why? whats wrong?  Best Regards."

It is still accessible by the ""internal"" 10.x.x.x address, but lost its public network interface. Now I can only connect to my instance via Java SSH client from the AWS Console.  More over, the instance menu ""Attach/Detach Network Interface"" items are greyed out.

37043,Amazon EC2 V1,"Elastic Network Interfaces are available in VPC only. If you are using the regular EC2 environment, this doesn't apply at all. In any case, the public IP address is mapped to the instance using 1:1 NAT. Because it isn't directly attached to an interface, the instance itself is not aware of that IP address. Based on your description, I believe nothing really happened to your interface. Did you perform a reboot or stop/start?

37042,Amazon EC2 V1,"This configuration is supposed to work just fine. You can definitely create A records for multiple domains using the same IP address. In case the instance is going to handle websites for these domains, the web server can serve the correct content by looking at the domain name used. It doesn't matter that the domains are using the same IP address.  If you can post or PM the domain names in question, it would be easier to find the problem. It sounds like a potential TTL issue, which means you might get the ""old"" value until it expires."

37041,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hello Chris,  The instance that keeps launching is due to the Auto Scaling settings within the Elastic Beanstalk application you have deployed.   The Auto Scaling settings control the metrics and thresholds used to determine when to add or remove an instance from an environment. When you terminate the instance, it's setup to have one running so it launches another.   In order to stop this action you'll want to Edit the Configuration for the Elastic Beanstalk to disable Auto Scaling, or terminate the environment altogether.   You can do this in the management console, in the Elastic Beanstalk tab, under Actions.   For more information about Elastic Beanstalk you can reference this page: http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/  In regards to the billing on your account, I'm sending an email to the address we have on file for you.

37039,Amazon EC2 V1,"EBS volumes are not perfect, even with replication, they still have a chance to fail. Estimated at around 0.5%  You want to do a multi tier backup solution. Snapshot data stored on s3 is replicated even more so than ebs volumes. So it has a lower chance of failure.

Once the server is up to date, everything is still running smooth with my password and I can log in and out as many times as I wish.  However, here is the tricky part...  Once I run the command ""dcpromo"" to setup the domain controller, I can still connect and reboot from the same computer that I used to setup the domain that day.  However, as soon as I give it a day or two or introduce a different computer to connect, my password becomes invalid.  Even thereafter, if I try once again with the computer that originally was used to setup the domain will result in an invalid access as well.  It seems as if it is loosing the password somehow.    Does anyone know how I can fix this or has had a similar problem? I would like to be able to have a domain setup and be able to log in as many times as I need.

Do you have the ability to try a different internet connection say from your smart phone or 3g usb dongle so that you can try and eliminate your local internet connection as a possible issue.  I am afraid that there is not a lot I can do for you right now, This instance looks healthy and reachable from the tests I have conducted.  Please let us know if you find any other information that may assist with the troubleshooting of the issue and we will try assist further.  Thanks JasonM"
37029,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi Jason,  I only have AVG on my PC, and after turning it off I still could not connect to my server. Thanks for checking the instance health, it's good to know for sure it has nothing to do with the instance itself.  I will try a different connection to see if that helps. Good idea!  When I get to the root of the issue, I will let you know.  Thanks, Timo"
37029,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi Jason,  Today I discovered that the network is the problem. I am using a different connection right now, and it works like a charm.

37028,Amazon EC2 V1,"Instance retirement over Easter? Please don't do that again. Hi, I got an email on Good Friday (public holiday in Australia, nobody is at work) telling me that an instance would be retired at midnight UTC on April 10.  That's 10:00am on Tuesday.  Monday is also a public holiday here, so I didn't get the email until 9:00am on Tuesday. This gave me JUST ONE HOUR to deal with the issue.  Please don't retire machines like this in the future. A retirement should have at LEAST a week's notice. Not just a few days over a long weekend.  Regards, Rick"
37028,Amazon EC2 V1,"Most of the time host retirement notices are sent out weeks ahead of time. Maybe AWS can comment as to why you received it when you did.  In being prepared for the future, if you are using EBS backed instances, you can stop start your instance to fail over to a new host. If you didn't do so before your host was retired, it would just be left in a stopped state.  Sometimes host retirements are due to hardware failures, which you will probably notice way before any notice is sent. If you stick to ebs backed instances, you can always fail away in an intentional or unintentional host retirement."
37028,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hello.  The time for the notifications will depends of the level of hardware failure that is happening, we try to predict and prevent any issue having multiple redundant layers of hardware, most of the time this will allow us to give you weeks of notice before we do the decommission of the server, however, sometimes we will have a short window to work.  My apologies for any issue that this may have cause you,  but please keep in mind that even with the more robust hardware, it could fail at any point.  If you need anything else, please let us know"

37024,Amazon EC2 V1,"sync file to 2 or more ec2 instance Hi,  I had the load balance on 2 or more instances, how to do file sync on those instances. Best if I updates on one instance and the system automatically sync to others.  Is this the way to do it using S3 storage. Having all the instances mount the S3 storage and only update the file to S3.   Will it reduce the speed of the web application running on the instances? How reliable for this method ? Any standard of doing this ?  PS : We are running Apache and tomcat on the ec2 instances. Dynamic data is store in RDS database. So only application file like html, js or images jpg files require update from time to time.  thanks."
37024,Amazon EC2 V1,"I presume you are talking about site application files?  In that case you can upload your application files as private into an s3 bucket. From there you could use a tool like s3cmd to copy the files to your instance.  ""Mounting"" an s3 bucket can be done, but it may not be entirely reliable. You don't want to read files directly form the mount, instead you want to copy the files to your local instance."
37024,Amazon EC2 V1,"In my opinion, your need is typically missing in AWS services. S3 can be used to share a filesystem between nodes, bet perfomences are very bad.  I put a iozone output in this post.

Edited by: Pierre Freund on Apr 9, 2012 4:08 PM"
37024,Amazon EC2 V1,"I think that depends. S3 was never intended to be a block device, its object storage and that is it. In many cases users can modify their application to use s3 as intended.  Now there are cases where customers are running applications that cannot be modified or they need to read/write to the same files. There are a couple of options in this case.   1. Set up an instance to share files (NFS/CIFS), this is most likely a single point of failure however. 2. Use a distributed FS like Guster or one of the other options on the market. This will provide similar functionality, but more fault tolerant."
37024,Amazon EC2 V1,thanks Pierre and Johansson.  Look like I have to build our own sync program or look into FS-Guster as point out by Johansson. Wonder how others ensure all instances in sync when using amazon load balancer. If only 2 instances we still can do it manually but not for a lot of instances.  Thanks
37024,Amazon EC2 V1,"If this is mainly application files you are talking about and not persistent data you can do something like this. Its best if you versioning of some sort. While you could do the checkouts directly from a repository, it may be more scalable to handle this through s3.  Write a script that would poll s3 on boot and an interval to check a file on s3 as to which is the latest code release.  If that version is different than what is on your current instance. Then run a command to update the code on your instance (Either from a copy on s3, or update from your repository)  If you have too many instances checking out code from your repository at once, it will probably overload your repository, hence it may be better to use an s3 bucket.  You will need to be careful that you make any database changes before you release new code. With a schema less datastore this is less of an issue, but is more definetly an issue with RDBMS systems."

37015,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hello to999,  I apologize for the inconvenience, however at this time the availability zone that you're trying to re-purchase a reservation in has constrained capacity. What this means is that due to several different factors we're unable to guarantee the capacity to run your instance for the term of the reservation that you've selected.""  You have the option to continue running the instances at the On Demand Rate after the Reservation is expired.   However, to receive a reduced rate, and capacity guarantees, you'd want to purchase a new Reservation in a zone that has availability. There are ways to transfer your data from one EC2 instance to another in a different zone. You can do that by creating an AMI from the old instances, and launching new ones using this AMI.   You are correct in regards to the Data Transfer charges. Data transferred between Amazon EC2 instances located in different Availability Zones in the same Region will be charged Regional Data Transfer.   In regards to the Medium and Heavy Utilization, the Reservations that were offered prior to the different utilization being offered defaulted to what we now call ""Medium"". With a medium RI you get a discounted hourly rate for any hours that your instance runs.   Heavy Utilization RI's are most appropriate for steady-state production workloads that will be always running, so you commit to the entire duration of the Reserved Instance term. With this RI, you pay a higher upfront payment than Medium Utilization RI's and the lowest hourly usage fee. Note that you are charged the low hourly rate for every hour of the Reserved Instance term you purchase, regardless of whether an applicable DB instance is running.

37011,Amazon EC2 V1,"ssh host key paranoia A recent forum post (which I can't find) got me to thinking more about ssh host keys and it seems to me that there are some weaknesses which have not been addressed.Â  I would appreciate feedback or pointers to clarify my thinking.1. It is my assumption that publicly known private ssh host keys are a bad thing.Â  Most of the public AMIs including ones from Amazon seem to bundle their ssh host key in the AMI.Â  This means that anybody can run the AMI, look at the host key, and know the host key for every other instance running that AMI.Now an ssh host key is not the same thing as the user's ssh keypair.Â  It will not get you access to the instance by itself.Â  In fact it's very difficult to exploit this security hole as you are going to have to be able to intercept network traffic between a person connecting to their instance and EC2 itself.Â  (Though I've seen people do things with TCP that would scorch your raised eyebrows.)The man-in-the-middle attack would intercept the ssh connection pretending to be the EC2 instance (since they know the ssh host key).Â  In addition, the attacker could proxy the resulting TCP stream through to the actual instance, spying on the clear text in the middle.Â  After the connection is completed with the user's ssh keypair, the user's side could be dropped and the server connection could be used to control the instance.2. In order to close the above security risk, I (and others) thought that it would be sufficient to generate new ssh host keys on the first boot of the instance. Logically, this makes the instance's host key be secret so that attackers don't know what it is.Â  This is now the default for the Ubuntu AMIs I publish on http://alestic.comHowever, I just realized the obvious fact that this also means the host key is secret from the person creating the instance.Â  When you first connect to the instance you are going to be offered a new host key which you must accept (explicitly or through configuration options) if you wish to continue the connection.The man-in-the-middle attach can now switch to making up its own new host key, offering that to the unsuspecting user, and pretending to be the EC2 instance until you got wise (which may be too late if you do things like upload EC2 keys early in your connection).3. In addition to simply pretending to be the EC2 host in (2), I am wondering if it is possible for the man-in-the-middle attacker to turn around and proxy through to a new ssh connection to the server (accepting its different host key).What I don't know is if the ""remote"" host public key is included in the calculations when the originating user's private key is used to sign things in the connection.Â  If it were, then the originator would be signing the public host key offered by the attacker and the EC2 instance might be able to reject the connection.Â  The man-in-the-middle would not be able to duplicate the signing with the user's private key.My brief cryptography training makes me think this would be a good thing for ssh to do, but I've gone a bit past my knowledge of the internals of ssh so I might not be making sense at this point 4. One approach which should avoid the known security risks in (1) and (2) and the suspected security risk in (3) is to create your own host keys on your local system and have the instance initialize itself with those keys.The Ubuntu AMIs I publish on http://alestic.com support a startup hook where you can pass a script in the instance user-data.Â  Your script could include the host keys or could download them from S3 or another secure location.5. If you are building your own private AMIs, you could generate host keys right before bundling (and save the public side for ssh clients).Â  This way you know what the host keys are for all new instances, and they are kept private.6. For the paranoid, I can't think of any way to connect safely to a public AMI unless it provides some sort of user-data startup hook or way to pass it the host keys through the user-data.Discussion?--Eric Hammondhttp://www.anvilon.com"

It doesn't matter who knows it.Â  What matters is that the instance trusts it and uses it to verify that the user is in possession of the private key.It actually does this by encrypting a random number, sending that to the user who decrypts it with the private key, makes a hash, sends it back to the host which checks the hash.I do not believe it is required for a man-in-the middle to be in possession of the user's public key in order to tell the user ""yes, I trust you are who you say you are"".Â  It is the instance(attacker) ""proving"" to itself that the user has the private key; it is not trying to prove to the user that it has the public key (as anybody could have this non-secret).The reason the user trusts the remote host is not because it has his public key, but rather it is based on the other (host) keypair.Â  I.e., the user has the host's public key and verifies that the host has the matching private key.Â  Unfortunately, on most EC2 instances the host's private key is not kept secret which is why the man-in-the-middle attack should work including proxying.I'd love to have somebody who knows the internals of ssh respond to this problem.Minor correction to (3) in my original post...

37011,Amazon EC2 V1,"Preventing a MiTM attack requires that the instance must have some secret that either only it knows, or that only it and the user know.Â  In the case of password authentication, that secret is the host key, and the user is required to either know or to verify the host key before revealing their password.Â  In the case of keypair authentication, I believe a MiTM attack will be prevented as long as the user's ""public"" key is kept secret, i.e., known only to the instance.Â  (I would suspect that the user's keypair is used to create the ssh secure channel--encryption secret, mac secret, etc.--and that if the""public"" key used by the instance does not match the private key used by the user, then the secure channel setup will fail and no login will occur.)Â  Amazon clearly studied the login security issue when they designed EC2, and I believe this is exactly the reason they created keypairs with a ""public"" key that is loaded into the instance when it is launched.Â  You have assumed that the ""public"" half of the user's keypair could in fact be public and known to anyone, but I believe that in order to achieve complete login security with EC2, this key needs to be kept private as well.P.S., You wrote ""I especially don't want to be connected to an attacker if he has the ability to replay/proxy my connection on to the remote instance and observe/inject"".Â  If the protocol is secure, these are not an issue."

37011,Amazon EC2 V1,"To summarize:At this point, we know there is a security risk of a man-in-the-middle pretending to be the EC2 instance for both of these cases:a.

Use a private AMI where you generate your own host keys before bundling.b. Use an AMI which allows you to upload your own host keys through user-data or a startup hook."
37011,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hello Eric,What you have described is one way of using asymmetric encryption, but it is not the only way.Â  What is most important is how the keypair is used in the ssh protocol.Â  I will take a look when I have a spare moment.Allen"
37011,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hello Eric,I have reviewed the SSH RFC's 4251, 4252 and 4253, as well as the helpful summary at http://www.mnin.org/write/2006_sshcrypto.html and I traced a connection using ssh -v.You are correct that the implementation used by Amazon is not secure against MiTM attacks.Â  Even assuming the user's public key were a secret and that it were not disclosed in the ssh protocol, this key is not used to generate the secure channel parameters, nor is the server required to prove it knows this key.One way to mitigate the MiTM vulnerability would be to connect to the instance's public IP address rather than its domain name.Â  This would make it much harder to execute a MiTM attack since the attacker will have to gain control of packet routing instead of DNS resolution.The two methods you mentioned would make the protocol fully secure, both of which essentially involve placing a secret host keypair on the instance, and having the user store the corresponding public key in their known hosts database.Â  Alternately, one of the other host authentication mechanisms (certificates signed by a CA) mentioned in RFC 4251 section 4.1 and RFC 4253 section 6.6 would need to be implemented on the instance and the user's machine.I'm surprised Amazon did not address this when they designed the instance boot up and login process.Allen"
37011,Amazon EC2 V1,"i would think that the easiest way to clear this threat would be to add some really good network detection.  at the network level you have DNS poisoning, and or invalid packets, or arp flooding.  so if there are vlans on the network for each instance, i would think that would be a high performance fix to reduce the risk, if my boxes are on a private vlan, then it reduces the chance of some random machine talking to mine.  good sub net masks, and firewalls that insure integrity should help too.  i am not sure i have seen amazon's network topography, and i am not sure they should publish it,  but at a network layer i would hope they are doing these two things.  as far as generating the host key goes, what about an RSA keychain? that should provide a wire free link between the user and amazon.  http://www.securehq.com/vendors.wml&vendorid=31&adv=GG it looks like the fabs are about $50  other than maybe a quantum mechanics solution.  i am not sure if there is a cell phone route that makes sense with amazon acting as a signing agent."
37011,Amazon EC2 V1,"Good point.Â  If port 22 on the instance were only authorized to your local workstation, this would also strongly prevent a MitM attack.Â  DNS manipulation alone would no longer do the job, because the attacker would not be able to send packets from his machine to the instance.Â  Simply rerouting your packets would also not be enough, because the attacker would have to make it look like the packets he sends come from your IP address, and he also need to be able to reroute packets sent from the instance to your IP address.In summary, we now have three techniques to reduce the threat of a MitM attack:1. Configure the instance (either in the AMI or at start up) with a secret host key, and add the corresponding public key to your known ssh hosts file.2. Configure the instance's firewall to only accept connections to TCP port 22 from your local workstation's IP address.3. Connect directly to the instance's public IP address, not its public DNS name.Secret host keys (technique 1) probably offers the highest level of protection, but in practice, they are subject to disclosure or social engineering attacks.Â  Therefore, the strongest protection would be gained by combining all three approaches.Â  But any one or two of these technique in combination would go a long way toward reducing the vulnerability.Â  Techniques 2 and 3 can be done currently without any modification of the AMI or instance boot process.Note there are also other potential vulnerabilities that we have not discussed:- Disclosure of the secret ssh login key.Â  Technique 2 would help guard against this as well.- Disclosure of the AWS account credentials.Â  This is mitigated by the fact that the secret ssh login key cannot be discovered using the AWS account credentials, and therefore, while a malicious user with the AWS account credentials would be able to open up the firewall or terminate the instance, he would not be able to login."
37011,Amazon EC2 V1,"socialhelix:Unfortunately, the attack could happen outside of Amazon's networks back where the client is starting the connection through their own network and ISP to get to EC2.Â  If that connection is intercepted and spoofed, Amazon can't help unless the client can detect that they're not connecting to EC2 (not currently possible for most AMIs).In order for the client to authenticate the server it must have a known public host key matching the server's truly secret private host key."
37011,Amazon EC2 V1,"In addition to the above-mentioned methods of uploading the host private key using user-data, here aresome other approaches which could be considered by Amazon to close thishole:1. Enhance the API to support the specification of a private host key(content).Â  This could be made available through the instance data anddownloaded and installed by the instance at startup, similar to how itinstalls the user public key.2. Copy what you did for the client ssh keypairs and support thecreation of separate *host* ssh keypairs.Â  The user downloads thepublic side and adds to known_hosts. At startup, the user specifies thehost keypair name similar to how we specify the client keypair name.Â The instance downloads and installs the host private key similarly.3. Share client and host keypair generation interface and namespace sothat the existing keypair list contains both.Â  The user downloads thepublic side and adds to known_hosts. At startup, the user specifieswhich keypair is for the client and which is for the host.Â  Theinstance gets the client's public key, and the host's private key toinstall. (I'm not a fan of this one as it gets messy and confusing)Unfortunately, pretty much every method to close this security holeseems to require existing AMIs to be rebuilt and customers to changehow they start the AMIs (if they care about security).It won't happen if we don't start on it, though"
37011,Amazon EC2 V1,"If Amazon were to do anything, I think #2 would be the best.Â  This would allow the user to launch all instances with the same private host key (if he wanted), and not have to copy the public key to his known hosts file every time.There might be another possibility involving host certificates that are signed by Amazon, but that would have to be investigated further.In the meantime, folks who are concerned about this can simply do one or more of the three things I listed in my prior post."
37011,Amazon EC2 V1,"There are two levels of attack currently being discussed:1. Pretending to be the EC2 instance and gaining information from what the client sends.2. Hijacking the connection to break in to the EC2 instance and taking control.Restricting the IP address source of ssh connections on the instance greatly reduces but does not eliminate the risk of the second.Â  It does nothing for the first.We have a known, proven method for secure connections to a remote host.Â  It involves both client and host keys used appropriately. We should work towards having this available on EC2.(Just to be clear, I am not disagreeing with the your post, Allen.Â  I am not against multiple lines of defense.)"
37011,Amazon EC2 V1,"You are correct.Â  Technique #2 would not prevent someone from setting up a spoof machine that tries to convince you it is your instance, in hopes that you will store valuable info on it.Â  In order to mitigate against an impersonator, you would have to use techniques #1 or #3.Â  Note however that an impersonator attack is a fair bit more difficult than a MitM attack, since with the impersonator attack, the attacker has to mimic your instance the best he can guess, and hope that you are fooled.Â  With a MitM attack, the attacker simply connects to your instance and proxies data both directions, i.e., with this attack, you are actually talking to your instance and the attacker does not need to guess what to send you.Â  That is not to say that an impersonator attack is impossible and should not be guarded again; it is only to say that technique #2 still has value, even though it does not guard against that specific attack."

37011,Amazon EC2 V1,"I'm not sure if amazon needs to solve this problem (granted, it might be nice if they did). If we generate new keys for each instance on (first) boot, then the problem is assuring that the public key offered by the host is actually the hosts public key and not a MITM.1. Instance generates new host keypair on first boot (or every boot)2. Instance uploads the public key or public key fingerprint to S3 bucket via SSL3. Client can download the public key/fingerprint via SSL and assure themselves that the public key offered by the remote server matches.In this case we use the ""trust"" in the SSL certificates & CAs to secure a second channel for passing the public key/fingerprint across.What am I missing?The ""integrated"" version of this solution would be offering a service like this as part of the describe-instances API - allowing an EC2 instance to add metadata about itself into information a client can access via describe-instances.Rob"
37011,Amazon EC2 V1,"Rob:I'd rather not involve another AWS service like S3 especially given the potential update lag, but it does look like it would work.Your proposed direct download through the API would be cleaner and should be considered by Amazon along with other potential options.I could think of lots of uses if Amazon created a generic mechanism to let us pass information from an instance out through the API calls"
37011,Amazon EC2 V1,"I see a problem with that solution:  1. Having the instance upload data to S3 means that it has to have access to credentials before the user gets ""first contact"" with the instance. If it does not send the details using credentials that only the user knows the user cannot trust that the data really comes from the instance and we are back att the MiTM problem since anyone could upload the details to S3!  2. Having the instance upload via the meta-data is troublesome since that means that any process running on the instance has access to this functionality. This is safer that it is now of course, but let's not forget that any application running on your instance can read and thus write to this very data.  Now #2 might not be such a big problem since we are most interested in fixing the problem with first contact since any attempt to tamper with the key after that would yield a message from PuTTY/ssh-client since it would notice that the key has changed since your last access to the same instance which would indicate that someone has been tampering with your instance. Note that the private key on the server itself would still be safe since it is writable by root only, so it is still a MiTM attack that we open ourselves for.  Adding the public key to known_hosts is close to impossible since that file contains hashes of ip addresses and host names, but the fingerprint of the hosts private key is usefull since both PuTTY and ssh displays that when it encounters an unknown key."

37010,Amazon EC2 V1,"Well I did try it with the EC2 tools, and not surprising ec2-run-instances works fine.  Of course it makes a soap request, not a REST request like the two different API's that I've tried."
37010,Amazon EC2 V1,"New to add -- I wrote a simple script that demonstrates the problem.  When I run this script on my local server it produces the invalid signature error.  When I run the same script on a running EC2 instance it works.  I'm using two different perl API's (Net::Amazon::EC2 and VM::EC2) and both produce the error from my local server and both work from a running EC2 instance.  I narrowed the trouble down to the encoding of the userdata.  One API uuencodes it for you, one requires you to do this on your own.  In both cases the uuencoding includes a trailing newline.  My presumption is that the signature doesn't match the request because the newline somehow is removed from the request after the signature was made.  Since both API's go through the same module (HTTP::Request) for generating the POST request something  must be different with this module between my local server and the running instance -- even though they are showing to be the same version."
37010,Amazon EC2 V1,"I found a solution to this problem.  I was using Net::Amazon::EC2 with MIME::Base64.    Adding some lwp dumps to EC2.pm allowed me to find the real issue: line endings  MIME::Base64 produces fixed-length lines with \n endings.  This is the format used to calculate the signature.  The HTTP POST made to amazon had all of the \n endings amended to \r\n, which no longer matches the sig.  If one simply applies a regex to the BASE64-encoded UserData, everything works fine:  # Encode for amazon: BASE64 + windows line endings. $user_data = MIME::Base64::encode($user_data); $user_data =~ s/\n/\r\n/gsm;"

This also explained why the problem just magically appeared -- someone had upgraded HTTP::Message on our server system.  Edited by: joewa19 on Apr 9, 2012 11:48 AM"
37009,Amazon EC2 V1,UCC Cretificates on Amazon ELB We are currently using a normal SSL certificate on the ELB.  We want to move to start using UUC (for multiple domains) Is that supported by the ELB?  Thank you!

37008,Amazon EC2 V1,"AsiaPacific Wowza linux server not accessible Hello,  I lauched a new Wowza instance in the Asia Pacific southeast region about an hour ago. I cannot ping the server or access the server. I have tried giving it an Elastic IP and that does not help. The status says running and it passes all the checks. I have launched 3 different server in the past hour or so and none of them are accessible. What is the problem? It never took this long for me to access a newly deployed server. Any suggestions?  Thanks"
37008,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi jhemby_kit,  I took a look at your account and found instance i-8c5996d8.  I was able to ping the instance as well as receive a response on SSH port 22.  Are you getting timed out when you try to ping?  Do you receive an error when you try to SSH to the instance?  Regards, Chen"
37008,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi Chen,  thanks for looking into this. I cannot ping the server. I get a timeout. I terminated that instance and created another one. i-526da206  I get the Request timed out message on this server as well. I checked the security groups and it is correct. Attached the screen shot:  thanks, Jermaine"
37008,Amazon EC2 V1,"Thanks for providing this information.  When I tried to ping the instance, I was also getting timed out.  When I took a look at the security group assigned to the instance, it is blocking ICMP traffic.  Can you add an inbound rule to Wowza security group for ICMP traffic?  I was able to receive a response on SSH.  Here is a sample output.  telnet ec2-122-248-202-118.ap-southeast-1.compute.amazonaws.com 22 Trying 122.248.202.118...

37006,Amazon EC2 V1,"EC2 instance disappeared We have a small EC2 instance attached to the plastic IP 75.101.157.179. This is our production server which has been running for a long time without problem, but sometime around this morning it has disappeared from the EC2 Management Console, and is now inaccessible using any means. We have not done anything on our side to cause this to happen. Please help!"
37006,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi,  I'm very sorry but the instance i-897744e3 associated with Elastic IP 75.101.157.179 has been terminated since it was scheduled for retirement.  There were 3 notifications sent to your email associated with your AWS account that mentions to launch a replacement instance and migrate data to that instance since its underlying host has been degraded due to hardware failure.  Notifications were sent on the following dates. 2011-04-26 2012-01-11 2012-04-03  Your instance was also instance-stored backed so it was using ephemeral storage.  For persistent storage, please use EBS volumes.  I noticed that EBS volume vol-3224b85a was attached to the instance so the data stored on there is still available.  You can attach it as another device on a Linux instance and mount it to browse the data.  At this point, you will have to launch a replacement instance for the one that retired and restore from a backup.  Regards, Chen"
37006,Amazon EC2 V1,"Thanks for your quick response. For whatever reasons we did not receive the email about the pending retirement of our server. Regardless, at this point I am not interested in disputing this, but rather I wonder if you could restore our server to let it live for another week. This is so that we can properly migrate it to an EBS-based type server, and also our website would not be down for days while we are trying to recover the data and do the migration."
37006,Amazon EC2 V1,"I'm sorry but we cannot restore the instance as its underlying host is no longer available since it has been degraded.  We also do not keep backups of your instances.  As a reference, we provide tools for you to backup instance-store backed Linux AMIs.  Here is a link with more information (http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/creating-an-ami-s3-linux.html).

I'm guessing because of that I can't access that instance yet.  Instance: i-f3c50694 AMI ID: ami-eece1d87  I'm not sure whether I did something wrong.  Please advise?  Many thanks.  WestDude

Please let us know if you have any questions."
37004,Amazon EC2 V1,"Thanks Ahmed.  No I could never boot the instance up.  It always come with the 1/2 passed checks.  I had tried it twice using the same AMI centos 6.2 64bit.

37004,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hello,  Have you had any successful launches with the AMI that you chose? You may want to chose another AMI because this AMI may have custom settings that require specific hardware.  Best,  Matt J"
37004,Amazon EC2 V1,Thanks Matt.  So how would I know which AMI I should use when I can't see the information per what you were saying?  I'll try other AMI but which one is the one with CentOS 6.2 64bit?  That's all the OS I care about..  Please advise?
37004,Amazon EC2 V1,"You can search for AMIs and the details here: https://aws.amazon.com/amis  For example, the following URL will list all CentOS AMIs:  https://aws.amazon.com/search?searchQuery=centos&searchPath=amis&x=0&y=0  Let me know if you have any more questions."
37004,Amazon EC2 V1,"That's not what I meant Ahmed.  I know how to search for the AMI but per Matt, perhaps I have selected an incorrect AMI that doesn't work with my current hardware setup.  The question is how do I know which one that fits with current hardware account that I have.  Because I'm still not having any luck loading the 64 bit Centos 6.2 .  You can take a look at the list you sent me.  Did you see any hardware definition in there?"
37004,Amazon EC2 V1,"Centos images are provided by the community and thus not supported by amazon. If you can't get support from the AMI creator, you can try to make your own using the bundle process.  If you want a centos like ami, i would suggest trying Amazon Linux. Most centos/rhel rpms will install on amazon linux."
37004,Amazon EC2 V1,"Thanks D.  Let me try to get some clarification so that I'm perfectly clear.  So you are saying that the community version is the untested AMI version by Amazon and it may or may not work and if it didn't, you are on your own.  Is that a fair statement?"

37003,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hello sandiloko,  This instance belongs to a different AWS account than the one you logged in with, that is why you cannot see it in the AWS Management Console.

To get further assistance with this, please contact our Account and Billing Support team using one of the options on our  Contact Us page.  Regards, Mary"
37003,Amazon EC2 V1,"If the instance belong to another AWS account, what about the billing?"
37003,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hello.

We use rapid ssl certificate for front-end connection and what certificate will be proper for back-end connection? Thanks in advance!
37001,Amazon EC2 V1,"Any certificate can be used for the backend. As it is used between the load balancer and instance only, the client won't see that certificate at all. You can go with the same certificate, or even a self-signed one. As far as I know, the load balancer doesn't perform any validation unless you enable backend authentication."

37000,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi,  The error message strongly indicates an incompatible format. Please ensure that your keys meet the following criteria as specified in the  documentation :  ""Supported formats:        OpenSSH public key format (e.g., the format in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys)        Base64 encoded DER format        SSH public key file format as specified in RFC4716  DSA keys are not supported. Make sure your key generator is set up to create RSA keys.  Supported lengths: 1024, 2048, and 4096.""  If your key does indeed meet the requirements, then there may be other issues. It would be very helpful to see the exact command you are using to generate the keys. We can then continue to narrow down the possibilities.  Regards,  Anthony"

36995,Amazon EC2 V1,"Cloudwatch INSUFFICIENT_DATA through api I'm setting up autoscale using the php sdk.  The autoscale group and associated components are created successfully, then I create a new alarm for CPUUtilization on AutoScalingGroupName=MyScaleGroup.  The autoscale group has a minimum of two instances, so two instances are created and everything is running fine.  The alarm status is set to INSUFFICIENT_DATA and will not change.  If I modify this alarm on the AWS site, without changing anything and just saving - the status will change to OK and will work properly from then on.  Do I need to wait for the autoscale group or another component to reach a certain status before creating the alarm?  I tried making my script wait a few minutes in between creating the scale group and the alarm - but it didn't make a difference.  Is this a known issue?  Is there a workaround?"
36995,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi,   You shouldn't need to wait, the Alarm should transition to either the OK or ALARM state once the metrics from the instances in your Autoscaling Group are flowing.     Could you PM me your AWS account ID, the name of the AWS region you are running your Autoscaling instances in and the name(s) of the Alarm(s) that exhibited this behavior?  We should then be able to look into this in more detail.  Thanks,  John."
36995,Amazon EC2 V1,It's been a couple of weeks since I PM'd you the requested details.  Do you have any updates?
36995,Amazon EC2 V1,"I would like to confirm this. I created an alarm through the boto python package, and it was stuck in the INSUFFICIENT_DATA state until I modified it through the AWS Console."
36995,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi,  Apologies for the delay.  Could you possibly resend that information to me via PM and I'll look into the issue today.  Regards, Eoghan"
36995,Amazon EC2 V1,I experimented with this and I determined that when I create an alarm for a custom metric then the problem happens. But when I create one for a regular metric then it works fine.
36995,Amazon EC2 V1,I have the same problem with custom metrics as well...  Is it also the same case; until data starts flowing in my custom metric the Alarm state will change from INSUFFICIENT_DATA to OK or ALARM?   Ant pointers from anyone who solved the issue or from aws team  Thank you
36995,Amazon EC2 V1,We were never able to resolve the issue using the api.  We switched to cloudformation to create our stack entirely and haven't experienced the issue once.  I could consistently reproduce using the api though - not sure what was wrong.
36995,Amazon EC2 V1,Thanks merrix143243 for sharing your experience...It is a bit wired that it worked trough cloud formation but not through the API  I'll give try through cloudformation...It would be great if AWS cloud watch and/or cloudformation  could explain why such things happen.. instability of certain API or version? or?  Thanks
36995,Amazon EC2 V1,"I ran into this same issue with the latest (2010-08-01) version of the Java API.  The CPUUtilization sensor reported insufficient data but would work again if modified in the AWS Console.  I was looking through the objects returned by the describe alarms call before and after the workaround and noticed that the ""fixed"" versions didn't have units while the broken ones had Unit:None.  Leaving the units out of the API call seems to have fixed my alarm creation code.  Solution: If you're programmatically creating the sensors and don't need a unit type, LEAVE IT OUT, don't specify None."

36986,Amazon EC2 V1,"When using ELB, how can the instance know the original URL the client used? Hi,  This question refers to the ELB (elastic load balancer).  I have my own domain. Lets call it ""acme.com"". I registered it with GoDaddy, and I keep my DNS there. At my DNS (on GoDaddy's hands) I created the CNAME ""services"". At this domain a run a web service, which should be called with the URL ""http://services.acme.com/....."". I have asked my clients to use that URL that uses the CNAME (subdomain) ""services"", and not to replace it with a static IP address or any other DNS name, because I can change the server IP, or add/drop/change a load balancer, etc, so they should not replace the original host in the URL. Well, some clients have detected that I'm using a ELB (elastic load balancer), and they are replacing the ""services.acme.com"" part with the DNS name of the ELB (lets say it is MyELB-123456789.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com). In other words, they are calling my service with a ""http://MyELB-123456789.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/......."". I guess they are doing it in order to spear their server the effort to resolve my CNAME to the DNS name of the load balancer.  I would like to detect when they do that, disable the response and ask them not to do it. But so far, I haven't found a way to do it.  My app is running on Tomcat. At this level, and in fact at the instance level, the request arrives using something like this: ""http://<internal ip of my EC2 host>/......."". The reason is that, given that I'm using a load balancer, the one that makes the HTTP request to my Tomcat server is not directly the client anymore, but the ELB acting as a proxy. So at the Tomcat/instance level, there is no way to determine the host in the URL that my clients use. So how can I disable the response when they do that? At the Tomcat/instance level is not possible. Can I do that at the ELB? I don't think so. At the security group in AWS account) I don't think so either. So? Is it possible?  An additional comment: The ELB should pass to our instances not only the original IP address of the client, but other values such as the client host name, the original URL, etc."
36986,Amazon EC2 V1,"I'm not that familiar with Tomcat, but in general the web server can inspect the HTTP Host header to determine which website to serve. It will always contain the original host name, which in your example will be either ""services.acme.com"" or the ELB DNS name. The idea is that you set up multiple virtual hosts, where each domain name has a unique configuration. This allows the server to handle the request differently based on the domain name used. Try searching for something like ""tomcat virtual hosts""."
36986,Amazon EC2 V1,"Thanks! The ""Host"" HTTP header gave me the information I needed. Perfect!  But now that you mentioned the virtual hosts: Actually I do use virtual hosts with Tomcat, in this very installation. But I have always had a problem with the ELB. I can tell Tomcat which virtual hosts must respond to which domains (configuring the domain in the XML configuration files), but the load balancer health checks also makes requests, and not addressing the domain names but the IP of the instance where Tomcat is. How does Tomcat know which virtual server must respond the checks? Do I have to configure the XML files with the IP of the load balancer? If so, what if this IP changes?"
36986,Amazon EC2 V1,"Tomcat really isn't my area of expertise, but one of the virtual hosts will most likely be considered as the default choice, or you can somehow set up one."

36982,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi TheCaptain,  I took a look at instance i-7a633717 and was able to get a response on TCP port 22 and 80.  SSH service was responding so it appears to be currently running.    You may find more information when you try to SSH in verbose mode (ssh -vvv -i keypair username@hostname).  The /var/log/messages file may also provide some additional information.  Please follow these steps to access the file in your instance.  Since the instance is EBS-backed, create a snapshot of the root EBS volume and then create a new EBS volume from that snapshot.  Once it has been created, attach it as another device (ex. /dev/sdf) on another Linux instance.  You will have to mount that device in the Linux OS and then you will be able to browse the filesystem to /var/log/messages.  Regards, Chen"

36977,Amazon EC2 V1,Hi there   There is no reason that I can think of that you should not be able to run this application. I would suggest that you check the asterisk support forums. can you post your instance id so that I can look at your instance to make sure it's operating correctly.  I am not too sure if your using an Elastic IP address on this instance to give a consitant endpoint for all of you sip uses and devices. I would suggest that you do this now if you have not already done so.  As a rule we do not provide support specific applications running inside EC2 instances but we will do our best to help troubleshoot any network/instance issues that your having.  Please find an external link to another forum about running Asterisk in EC2 http://forum.voxilla.com/asterisk-support-forum/asterisk-cloud-asterisk-1-6-0-5-optimized-amazon-ec2-33857.html  Regards JasonM

I am not certain what is going on with your instance. I don't see an issue with AWS resources. You could try detaching the boot volume and then attaching it to an available device of a Win2k3 instance to examine the event logs for errors. If you need to get your services up and running in the meantime, you could launch a new instance either from a custom AMI or the new Win2k8 AMI.  Regards, Mary"

36973,Amazon EC2 V1,"AWS EC2 Elastic IPs bandwidth usage and charges questions I have a little questions regarding Elastic IPs and its charge. Some blogs says that Elastic IP will charge you by the bandwidth you use    Elastic IP addresses **charge by bandwidth** and have an hourly price when they are not attached to a running instance  From http://things.zarate.org/scaling-a-single-ec2-instance-and-downsizing   From my understanding after reading some blogs and the documentation, you will only be charged IF you use the elastic IPs in communicating BETWEEN instances AND if you have elastic IPs standing there idle on your account without being associated to your instance   If you communicate between instances using public or elastic IP address even in the same region you pay regional data transfer rates(0.01$ per GB in/out).  From http://www.cloudiquity.com/2009/02/using-amazon-ec2-public-ip-address-inside-ec2-network/  See AWS calculator screenshot -> http://shareimage.org/images/lzjj3eull2ux0lo663fr.png  So my confusion is on the part whether AWS charge for ANY KINDS of traffic requests (Using my browser, SSH ) using the elastic IPs?   So if for example: I ssh-ed to my instances using the elastic IPs (For example 8.8.8.8) instead of the public dns name given like ec2-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx.compute-1.amazonaws.com, will this bandwidth registered as simple bandwidth in/out usage or the public/elastic IP bandwidth?   Thanks"
36973,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi,  As you indicated you will be charged for the bandwidth no matter the type of IP address associated to your instance - that is, EIP or regular IP. EIPs are charged only when they are not associated to an instance but otherwise they are free. When not mapped to an instance, they cost $0.01 per hour. Additional details are available here: http://aws.amazon.com/articles/1346  Let us know if you have any more questions."

36970,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi Jay,  From the telnet output, it looks like something on your network (OS firewall or corporate firewall) is blocking outbound connections on the RDP port. I would recommend checking your firewall settings or contacting the network administrator of your network.  Thank you for sharing the tracert output but this is an ICMP tracert which doesn't help in this situation. To do a TCP traceroute, you will have to download and install the tool from here: http://tracetcp.sourceforge.net/  I hope this information helps but let me know if you have any additional questions."

36968,Amazon EC2 V1,"ELB - poor balancing between instances and zones I currently have 4 c1.medium instances (2 in zone C and 2 in zone D).   However, the load on the 2 instances in the ""C"" zone are always higher.  This has been true for quite some time.  This issue is most noticeable when there is a traffic increase; new requests mostly end up in the ""C"" zone instances.   Basically these two ""C"" instances always run hot, while the ""D"" instances just putter along (with a reasonable connection load, but nothing like the other two).  I had tried 4 instances across 4 zones, but I then had really significant issues with a single instance getting hammered.  Having multiple instances per zone seems to be better, but the problem still remains.  I was previously using a dedicated instance with HAProxy, and I never had balancing issues with the same number (and size) of instances.   Is there a better way to configure ELB, or is this just a limitation of this service?  i-6bd1ab0f web1m c i-75d1ab11 web2m c  i-d92d68bd web3m d i-db2d68bf web4m d"
36968,Amazon EC2 V1,"This sounds quite odd. Are these requests coming in from a diverse number of locations, or do you have a large amount of users on a single network for example? Is this a website, meaning the load balancer is accessed primarily from various web browsers?"
36968,Amazon EC2 V1,"These requests should be coming for a wide set of locations (web browsers; this is a web site with traffic throughout the US as well as internationally.  It is possible that bots, zombies or other crawlers might be introducing a spike from a particular address.  I am using sticky sessions just like I was with haproxy, which didn't seem to have this issue."
36968,Amazon EC2 V1,"I would expect it to work well, but obviously it doesn't.  The ELB will have at least one IP address in each enabled availability zone. When the client resolves the ELB DNS name or Route 53 alias, it gets one or more IP addresses. The IP address used determines which availability zone that particular client ends up in. When you use sticky sessions, requests sent to the ""wrong"" zone will be forwarded in order to get to the correct instance. When you have requests coming in from a diverse number of locations, the initial availability zone selection will be random enough.  Are you using a CNAME record, or a Route 53 alias? It probably doesn't matter much, but I'm asking just in case. This issue might be something AWS will need to look into for you."
36968,Amazon EC2 V1,"I suggest you take a look at the health reported by ELB of the hosts you have registered with ELB.   If the hosts in one zone are sometimes failing health checks, ELB might send your traffic to the other zone. Over time, especially with sticky sessions enabled, you'd start building a bias for the zone that is more likely to have healthy instances.  Regards, Paul Coleman"
36968,Amazon EC2 V1,"I did carefully monitor all of the health check graphs in cloud watch and there weren't any errors.  I believe now the load to the ELB ends up increasing faster than ELB is implemented to handle.     Additionally I later had an instance fail at which point ELB's behavior was completed unacceptable.  With 4 instances across 2 zones, a single failure causes the remaining instance in the zone to get too much traffic causing a cascading failure.  At this point I've determined that ELB doesn't meet our requirements and have moved back to HA Proxy which is working as expected."

36965,Amazon EC2 V1,"Few questions about Instances, AMI, volumes and other options Heya  I gotta say I'm quite new to this, friend recommended it as cheap render farm but so far I'm just overwhelm and dont know what to do... I follow this tutorial to set up my 3ds max render farm... http://www.judpratt.com/tutorials/ec2-renderfarm/#comment-421  In any case. I want to use a spot instances = as far as I understand I bid for them on hourly basis, and I can be outbid at which point my instance will be shut down - fair enough I know how much I pay for how long - roughly...  Also there is no current price for  cc1.4xlarge.23 gb cluster - how much do I type in the $box? Also if I type 1 does it mean I bid it for 1$? And if so, will I pay 1$ or the minimum maximum fee that it require before I hit 1$ max limit - thats confusing.  Also I pay per core? so I pay 8$ for 8 cores? What is ECU ?   AMIS - is image of my HDD that contain all the data, set ups etc etc -- right? Do I pay anything for AMI that is 60 gb of size? I guess I need 2x AMI, 1x for manager master, and 1x for slave and all salve settings ?  Volumes = its HDD space that I use to load AMI in to. I pay for it a 0.10c per gb per month right ? so 60 gb for system + 30gb for render files = 9$ per month right? How does it work if I only use and create it at the time of creation of spot instances? I pay just for hour usage?  Snapshot - is an image of HDD so once I create Master and Slave Image - which ten I save as AMI I can delete my snapshots and dont pay for them right?  Is there a place on this web where I can find how much I own so far to amazon? I cant find a proper billing area   I sure hope I wont pay by accident all my Â£ for this servis lol   Thanks, bye."

Here's some background on this instance:  1. Starting Thursday, April 5th I began seeing intermittent issues with the instance connecting to the mysql host on another ec2 instance.  This behaviour lasts for a couple of hours, resolves itself for a couple of hours, then comes back.  2. On Friday, April 6th I created a new ec2 instance that connected to the same mysql instance as the instance above.  It's had no problems connecting while the initial instance continued to have intermittent issues. 3. Today I tried searching for a yum package on the problematic instance.  I got an error similar to this one: 	 Couldn't resolve host 'packages.us-west-1.amazonaws.com'.  A search on the AWS forums told me to try stopping and starting the instance. 4. I selected the instance in AWS management console and clicked 'Stop'. 5. After waiting 15 minutes for the instance to stop I again selected the instance in AWS management console and clicked 'Stop'.  The page told me this would do a force stop.  I've waited 30 minutes or so, and it still says 'stopping'.  Can you please stop it for me?  Edited by: Jennifer Rullmann on Apr 7, 2012 7:43 AM"

36960,Amazon EC2 V1,"AWS is not like a shared hosting service where you have a cPanel (or other) front end.  You're actually launching a server and will be interacting with it as if it were a physical server you had built.  That said, perhaps someone is aware of an AMI that you can use that has a cPanel or something similar built in to it."
36960,Amazon EC2 V1,"thanks for the help, so is it only direct access through ssh as opposed to some form of control panel to setup mailboxes, phpmyadmin etc?  thanks again"
36960,Amazon EC2 V1,Hi there if you were so inclined you could install Cpanel yourself or some other web console such as webmin.  By default Amazon instances are stand alone linux installs that you can put anything on that suites your specific use case.  Thanks JasonM

36960,Amazon EC2 V1,The answer is to learn how to use putty and ssh into the machine.  It is your only option till you install software that allows you to log in via the web in the way you want to.

36947,Amazon EC2 V1,"System problem? Noticed that I can't access the website I'm hosting with AWS this morning. Couldn't connect via SSH either. Checked the control panel -- both system and instance checks failed. Tried rebooting the instance -- no effect. Even the system log showed the previous boot-up sequence from a few weeks ago (i.e. rebooting didn't even register?). Tried stopping and starting the instance -- that didn't work either as the instance is now stuck in the ""stopping"" state (for over an hour now). Also tried ""force stop"" twice with no effect.   Furthermore, I tried making a snapshot of the volume used by this instance (which is still in the ""stopping"" state), creating a new AMI from it and launching a new instance, but that failed too -- the system log for the new instance shows: ""Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(8,1)"". I sure hope the data isn't completely hosed...  As far as I can tell it's something with AWS infrastructure as this is a simple LAMP setup with minimal modifications to the standard Amazon AMI, very little load, and I haven't logged in to this instance for a good number of days. So I can't think of any ways I could have caused this with my actions (the instance stopped responding about 4 hours ago, based on the monitoring charts).  Instance: i-0a29603a  And I also have to say that it is quite a bit of an unpleasant surprise that this is the only way you can get support from Amazon about AWS. I understand not answering Linux support questions, but when it is clearly an issue with your cloud hardware/infrastructure?! Forum is the only way, really?! Doesn't really bode well for my plans to move our company's servers to AWS (I'm currently evaluating if it would be a good idea on a trial basis with a smaller website)."
36947,Amazon EC2 V1,"Premium support is available, but like everything else, its up to you to decide whether or not you need it and what level you need. Its not ""baked in"" to the usage rates.  Now its unlikely that you did anything to cause this problem. In most cases such as this is often a host failure. Unfortunately this may result in the instance being difficult to stop.   As far as your new instance, make sure the volume is mounted to the correct mount point. /dev/sda1. Anything else will result in a boot failure."
36947,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hello zen-noir,  I have engaged our EC2 Service Team to look into this stuck instance.  Regards, Mary"
36947,Amazon EC2 V1,"I have to say, I'm glad I've done this trial run before we started spending thousands of dollars on AWS. My understanding was that the whole point of using a cloud platform is that you don't have to worry about hardware/uptime issues. I guess Amazon hasn't figured that out yet.    Over 6 hours downtime so far, the instance is still ""stopping"", can't even get the data out to start a new instance (can't detach the volume from the instance, and creating a snapshot results in a broken AMI). And no way to get any support from Amazon (other than to pay for the ""premium support"" of course).   You'd expect that all systems in the cloud would be monitored and fixed as soon as any issues are detected. So far it seems Amazon either doesn't care, or has no good monitoring/repair policies in place. You'd think that as soon as one the system checks fail, they'd dispatch a tech to fix it. Instead of me waking up to a dead website and frantically trying to figure out how to get a hold of someone at Amazon to fix it.   Regarding ""premium support"". I have to pay $400 per month (1-hour response) to get AWS to do their job supporting their hardware/infrastructure?! Really?! I can talk to a human on the phone at our current facility in 3 minutes, and have any of our servers restarted/power-cycled or hooked to a console and have any issues diagnosed right on the spot -- all that included for free (up to a reasonable amount of remote-hands time per month of course, but we haven't hit that limit even once in over 8 years)."
36947,Amazon EC2 V1,"EC2 is IAAS (Infrastructure as a Service) and not PAAS (Platform as a Service) like Google App Engine.  This gives you more flexibility as you have access to the base OS in your systems, but you have to design your infrastructure to handle uptime and availability if you need it. Its a tradeoff but its important to understand the distinction.   I also agree there is a lot of marketing hype around cloud services that cloud the details of how they work.  If you understand how to use EC2 and plan for problems, you can get away without needing premium support. I manage around 20 instances for over a year without needing premium support.  Support is never free, if you don't pay for it directly, its baked into the other costs you pay."
36947,Amazon EC2 V1,"Thank you, Mary, it appears someone was finally able to get to this issue and fix it. The instance was finally stopped, and I was able to start it just fine and it's running again without any issues.   I would still like to know what happened here exactly? Why did the instance stop responding in the first place (hardware failure?) and why stopping it just locked everything up and required ""Service Team"" to get involved? And most importantly, how often do you expect this to happen, and how do I avoid the 6+ hour downtime each time?"
36947,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hello Friend,  I have seen all senior you have faced with Amazon instance. As per your word your are facing lot of problem during the website and hardware related issue. (eg. instance not stop or not restart etc.)  I have also seen amazon replied on it.   I have also using amazon all services for my company, i am monitoring around 20-30 servers and any other servies.   I know very well all such type of issues. We can resolve without amazon help support.  For avoid such type problem in future we should apply backup plan for the servers so that if you face any issues you can run new instance quickly with your last configurations of the server.

36946,Amazon EC2 V1,"@aws looking for clear ans: autoscale+elb route to zones with no instances? I've seen many posts on this subject with no clear answer from AWS or docs.  I have an autoscale cluster that I want fault tolerant as possible. Because of this I create my autoscale group with '--availability-zones us-east-1a,us-east-1b,us-east-1c,us-east-1e'.  However, I only want max 2 instances in my cluster.  How do I setup my ELB such that it will only route traffic to zones where an instance is?   Is it OK to enable all zones? Ex: elb-enable-zones-for-lb my-elb --availability-zones us-east-1a,us-east-1b,us-east-1c,us-east-1e  From what I can tell, there is no programmatic way to dynamically enable/disable elb zones based on autoscale.  Reason I even bring this up, is I'm seeing strange behavior where when I run: curl -gv ""http://mydomainservedbyelb.com/test.html""  I randomly get 'Empty reply from server' errors."
36946,Amazon EC2 V1,"Its not a good idea to enable zones that you have no instances in, you may see an increase in 503 errors. Your best bet is to stick with just two zones and put one instance in each.  Also you want to keep the number of instances even between each zone."

However, I have other ELB's with the same setup (less instances then elb enabled zones) and I do not see this issue.  Is there a definitive answer for how ELBs route to enabled zones with no instances?  How do you dynamically enable/disable zones on an elb if your using autoscale?  Or is it really not meant to be dynamic."

Johansson already mentioned, I would like to take the opportunity to recommend this thread. To summarize, a request ending up in an empty zone will either be forwarded or not handled at all (read: hang). The exact implementation details are not known. You are generally recommended not to leave any enabled zones empty."
36946,Amazon EC2 V1,"D. Svanuld, thanks for the link.  What concerns me however is the aws support person says ""You certainly should not do this on purpose, and enabling a zone without any instances will only add latency (as measured from the client perspective, not from the ELB perspective) and not provide any protection from failure.""  I am OK with the additional latency if there is an enabled zone with no instances - however I am not OK with it not returning any sort of data to the client (problem I'm seeing).  I'm guessing the quoted scenario applies only to zones which at one time had healthy instances but no longer do.  I would like clarity on this, but am guessing it wont be disclosed as it gets into implementation details.  So long story short, trying to enable more zones then max instances to get higher zone fault tolerance is not possible in an automated manor.    IMO the ELB logic should be changed to only route to zones that have healthy instances, and not be forced to specify.  You should be able to specify if you want faster response times, but also open all if your more concerned about HA."

As the exact implementation details are unknown, I wouldn't count on it. It seems like we are getting too deep. The ELB could definitely be smarter and return only IP addresses for availability zones with healthy instances. That sounds like a quite reasonable feature request. But at this time, enable only the availability zones where you intend to have instances running. That will keep you out of trouble."
36946,Amazon EC2 V1,Removing the enabled zones where no instances are resolved the issue.  @aws this would be a good feature to add.   thanks all for the info.

36940,Amazon EC2 V1,"Does AWS Throttle HTTP Traffic on EC2 Linux/Tomcat? I've been trying to evaluate EC2 for some use cases that involve very-high transaction rates.  I have deployed a very simple servlet on tomcat 7 running on ubuntu.  I seem to be hitting a wall at around 1000 reqs/sec.  I've tried a variety of load generation techniques, but I recently noticed that a single JMeter instance (running within EC2) will generate load up to about 1000 reqs/sec.  Running two EC2 instances executing Jmeter (in different zones, etc.) the number of req/sec handled by the servlet is still about 1000/sec, with the rate split between the two clients.  Regardless of how many instances I add to the load balancer sitting in front of tomcat, or how many clients I use, I can't seem to shake the 1000/sec barrier.    The servlet is simply adding messages to an SQS queue, so I don't think there is significant resource contention.  I saw a similar rate limit when updating a memcached value rather than inserting a message into a queue.  My guess is that this is happening at the TCP layer on the server side, but I can't find any information for what the official rate limit is, or how to get it increased.  The irony here is that I made a move from Google App Engine to AWS because I ran into a 750 req/sec wall on GAE and couldn't get a response from Google on how to get around that limit.  Not sure where to go from here...  Ultimately I'm going to need significantly higher burst rates for max reqs/sec.  Is this just not possible on AWS, or is that level of functionality reserved for only certain partners?  Thanks in advance for any light that anyone can shed on the problem.  Edited by: David S. Keyes on Apr 6, 2012 12:35 AM"
36940,Amazon EC2 V1,"There is no limit, but the load balancer do have scaling policies that adapt to the incoming traffic.  Are you scaling up traffic quickly or are you letting it build over time?

36940,Amazon EC2 V1,"I am scaling up my requests aggressively, mainly because that's what I expect my load patterns to look like (e.g., very ""spiky"" load motivated by live user voting patterns).  I start 200 threads immediately, firing as fast as possible, sending a total of 100k requests.  In-other-words, my load patterns are likely to look very much like localized DOS attacks...  Are there ways to configure the load balancer policies?  Since my jmeter load balancers are running on ec2 instances, calling OUT to other ec2 instances, is it possible i'm running into a limit on OUTGOING traffic, or should all of that be a non-issue?"
36940,Amazon EC2 V1,"As I understand it, AWS can do some modification to your load balancer policies or pre-warming your load balancer if you expect a sudden increase in traffic, but may need to go through premium support for that."
36940,Amazon EC2 V1,"I'm getting more and more confused .  Everyone who seems to know claims that ""there is no limit"" on ELB, other than the fact that throughput ramps ""slowly"" or based on some kind of mysterious policy-based configuration.  That makes sense.  To validate, I cranked up server size of a SINGLE instance of my tomcat config, all the way to x-large, skipped the ELB and ran tests against the EC2 instance directly.  CPU is flat on the server, but I'm still maxing out at about 1000 req/s.  Run many clients on multiple EC2 instances -- 1000/sec gets divided between them.  I suppose this is going to ultimately cost me a premium support engagement.  Quite frankly, none of it makes sense to me other than some kind of hard-core throttling that everyone says doesn't happen."

36936,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi Spreaker,  I have checked the underlying host this instance is running on. It looks like the CPU load on this host was elevated during the time of this spike, likely due to something that was running on one of the instances that was running on it at the time. It has returned to normal since this time.  This instance is an instance store instance. You may want to consider moving to an EBS-backed instance, which would make it easier to relocate to a different underlying host. For more information about these, you can reference this  documentation.  Regards, Mary"

36934,Amazon EC2 V1,"NTLM client on EC2 fails authentication with response: Unauthorized I have a java client that talks to NTLM (v1 and v2) servers remotely using sardine and the new httpclient libs.  This runs perfectly in tomcat on my test environment.  When I deploy it to EC2, however, its like the authorization process is stripped or blocked, and authentication fails.  I've tried for a week now to isolate if this is a firewall, proxy or java issue, to no avail.  Again, this code works perfectly on tomcat 7 in my test environment, which is behind a NAT environment, talking to a publicly accessible NTLM protected http host.  When deployed in EC2, that same connection to the same public host fails, so something is clearly different about the EC2 environment.  My app is deployed on elastic beanstalk, iptables is disabled.  Any ideas ?  Edited by: andrewschwabe on Apr 3, 2012 8:28 PM"
36934,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi,  My first guess would be that it is likely because one of the ports used is blocked at the EC2 Security Group level. This is in addition to making sure that iptables is disabled.   I checked the four currently running instances under your AWS account and each of them has specific port ranges open. To test and make sure if this is not caused by a port that is blocked at the Security Group level, I suggest that you open all ports (only temporarily) just test the connectivity again. If it lets you connects, you will know right away if there is yet another port (or range of ports) that you need to port to open.   If the open-port test fails to connect, you can further test by running TCP trace route or any other network diagnostic tools available to further narrow down and see where it is failing. I also suggest checking to see if the request comes through and reaches the instances. That can tell you if there is an authentication failure or network connectivity failure.   Regards, Tariq Amazon Web Services"
36934,Amazon EC2 V1,"Thanks for your reply.  I did actually open all ports and test however that didn't help.  As I suspected, those rules are for inbound through the load balancer.  My connection originates from the ec2 instance out to another public ip so the ec2 instance is the client.  Do the load balances or the nat translation prevent pass through to ntlm or other similar like pptp?"
36934,Amazon EC2 V1,"Sorry I was not sure if the EC2 instance is the client or the server. In this case, it's definitely not the Security Group (unless the instance is in the VPC where both ingress and egress rules apply).   It's possible that failure occurs if the server checks the IP address of the client and if the client presents its Private IP address instead. I'm just guessing that's what's probably happening as long the server is receiving the request from the EC2 instance.  As I suggested earlier, you may try TCP-based (not the normal ICMP-based) trace route to first verify that the instance is reaching the server. I'm guessing it is reaching it because you do see authentication taking place (even though it's rejection with the ""Unauthorized"" response). Once you've confirmed that the two sides are talking on the port used by the server, you can then possibly do a network capture to see if that shows something that helps you.  There is nothing going on, on the NAT that could prevent anything like this except for the fact that the IP address that your instance's OS and applications see (i.e. the private IP address) is different from what the external servers/clients see (i.e. the public or Elastic IP address). This can sometimes cause problems with authentication failures.  Also, please verify that the date/time on the server EC2 instance along with the time zone is set up correctly. That could also cause authentication failures.  Regards, Tariq Amazon Web Services"

36934,Amazon EC2 V1,"I did further testing, running an instance NOT behind an ELB, with same results.  I also deployed using a different java container (other than tomcat) and voila, it worked, so I have since identified that it is the config for elasticbeanstalk's tomcat.  Further research showed that the authentication prefs for tomcat weigh kerberos ahead of NTLM, which was the problem...  An application level issue after all, not AWS at all.  For anybody seeing something similar, in my java code, here is what needed to change:  Instead of ADDING an authentication scheme: 	this.client.getAuthSchemes().register(""ntlm"", new NTLMSchemeFactory()); 	(which puts ntlm behind anything else already in the authschemes)  I had to create a new scheme, and only put in ntlm (so it is the first choice):  	AuthSchemeRegistry newreg = new AuthSchemeRegistry(); 	newreg.register(""ntlm"", new NTLMSchemeFactory()); 	this.client.setAuthSchemes(newreg);  Then it worked like a charm.

We need to understand where was the problem: on our side or on yours.  Thanks!"
36931,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi,  I have reviewed the instances you mentioned and the Auto Scaling policy that triggered this termination of instance(s).   You have two AS policies that define when instances are terminated and launched: soapblox-up and soapblox-down.  Now these AS policies are tied to two CloudWatch Alarms you have set up: soapblox+1 and soapblox-1.  The CW Alarms soapblox+1 is triggered each time one of the two instance's CPU hits 70% utilization and stays there for 60 seconds. Each of these instances were terminated because the CPU utilization reached a sustained 70% utilization for over 60 seconds. This resulted in the associated Auto Scaling policy to trigger the actions it was set up to do, resulting in launching of a new instance and termination of old one.  If this is what you were expecting the Auto Scaling policy to do, then it's working as you defined the policy. If you think you need to adjust the CPU threshold to a higher value and longer duration, you can adjust the CW Alarms.  Hope this explains it. For more details on CloudWatch and Auto Scaling, please see the documentation:   CloudWatch: http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/cloudwatch/  Auto Scaling: http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/autoscaling/  Regards, Tariq Amazon Web Services"
36931,Amazon EC2 V1,"Correct my if I'm wrong:  The CW Alarms soapblox+1 is triggered each time one of the two instance's CPU hits 70% utilization and stays there for 60 seconds.  1) Not one of the two instances, but ""when the average CPU utilization of Amazon EC2 fleet goes above 70 percent"".  The ""CW Alarms soapblox+1"" watches for average CPU utilization of all instances inside the auto scaling group. Isn't it? 2) Not 60 seconds, but ""Threshold: CPUUtilization >= 70 for 15 minutes""  Each of these instances were terminated because the CPU utilization reached a sustained 70% utilization for over 60 seconds. This resulted in the associated Auto Scaling policy to trigger the actions it was set up to do, resulting in launching of a new instance and termination of old one.  The ""CW Alarms soapblox+1"" can't terminate any instances, because it is designed only to add instances :  Actions: in ALARM state - 	Use policy ""soapblox-up (Add 1 instance)"" for group ""soapblox-group"" Isn't it?  Even the ""CW Alarms soapblox-1"" can't terminate all instances, because auto scaling group is configured with the option ""--min-size 2"". So at least 2 instances must be and auto scaling policy can't reduce the number low then 2.  Moreover, according to scaling activity logs above, instances were terminated because of they became ""unhealthy""  (an instance was taken out of service in response to a system health-check.,0,Terminating EC2 instance i-3e362f5a). The auto scaling group (soapblox-group) configured with the ""--health-check-type ELB"", so ELB didn't get proper response for a period of time, marked instances unhealthy and AS group killed instances...."
36931,Amazon EC2 V1,"When you add one additional instance because of CPU utilization, the total size of the instances changes from 2 to 3. Your AS policy only allows 2 instances at a given time.

36931,Amazon EC2 V1,"Thanks for the answer. But I just tried to find out the cause of the issue: why instances became unhealthy? We just need to be sure it was not amazon fail. Because we get a lot of abuses from our clients after each server's fail. And we can't see logs of instances, because instances were terminated."
36931,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hello,  The reason ELB would mark an instance unhealthy is when the instance fails to respond to the health check."

36926,Amazon EC2 V1,"ec2-register Server.InternalError Hi to everybody, I'm trying to upload a custom AMI to S3 and register it. I was able to bundle and upload the image in my bucket, in fact I can see all the parts and the manifest of the AMI from the S3 browser of the AWS Management Console. The problem occurs when I try to register the AMI using the ec2-register command.   At first I found this post: https://forums.aws.amazon.com/message.jspa?messageID=324344  that explains the problem could be caused by '-' '_' used in the img name, so since the name of the image I was trying to register was SGE-EC2.img I deleted the old parts and manifest from the bucket and I uploaded another image with name SGEC2.img. Useless to say, the problem was still here...  The command I used was  ec2-register amirepository/SGEC2.img.manifest.xml -n SGEC2  the bucket was in the US Standard region so I didn't need to specify the region and url. The environment variable EC2_CERT and EC2_PRIVATE_KEY are correctly set, but for security I also tried to directly specify them with -K and -C options.  Another thing I tried is to reupload the image but in a bucket located in another region, so I created an amirepo bucket in region eu-west-1 and I re-tried to register the image with the command:  ec2-register --url https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com --region eu-west-1  amirepo/SGEC2.img.manifest.xml  The problem was still there.  I also tried to directly use the AWS Management Console interface to register the image, but the same Server.InternalError error was displayed both for the image I uploaded in the us standard region and the eu-west-1 bucket.  The full output (with --verbose and --debug options ) of the ec2-register --url https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com --region eu-west-1  amirepo/SGEC2.img.manifest.xml command is:  Verbose output:

36925,Amazon EC2 V1,"EC2 instance under DDoS attack We have a cluster of EC2 instances powering our Rails web app.  We've had DDoS attacks for the last couple of weeks; and another one is occurring now.  We've been banning ips using iptables, but a new wave of them pops up every time. Can this traffic be blocked at the Amazon edge routers? How do you deal with this in general?"
36925,Amazon EC2 V1,How would amazon know that the traffic you want it to drop is malicious?  Bill
36925,Amazon EC2 V1,"It would be pretty easy for Amazon to help protect against syn flooding, for example.  Would love to see more options added to security groups to help deny these 'globally' per a security group instead of customers having to manage these on a per server basis.    In addition, having functionality within security groups to allow customers to quickly lockdown traffic to /from specific countries in the case of active attacks would be sweet.  Once a box comes under attack, shear load will usually prohibit an admin from being able to SSH and take any actions.  Another thought, expand the monitoring offering to enable per country/subnet based input.  Would greatly help identify where the botnet traffic is coming from without needing to ssh out to servers."
36925,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hmm, Can you think of a reason why someone would want to DDoS you? Could it be that someone is scraping your site? Does the DDoS traffic look like normal traffic? If so how are you identifying the ones to block? If not can you use that to block them?"
36925,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi   Depending on how you have your instances configured, you might consider the following:  1) Allocate a new EIP  2) Detach the original EIP from your instance  3) Attach the new EIP  4) Update your DNS settings to reflect the new IP address   If you are seeing unusual network traffic then this might alleviate the problem (but only if you're being targeted via the IP address and not CNAME). If you post up the instance ID, I will also take a look for you and see if there is anything additional that might be done.  Please be aware that AWS does have DDOS mitigation however I am of course not at liberty to disclose what these might be.  The fastest way to engage us would be via Premium Support however, as mentioned, if you post your instance ID up I will check for you.   Thanks  CallumH"
36925,Amazon EC2 V1,"Thanks, Callumh.  Pretty old thread but recently had another attack sneak through my rules.  Instance id i-cdebc488.  It was a couple days back.   My bill is also taking a huge hit for this on the outbound bandwidth.  My normal bandwidth is roughly 10-12gb.  So far in this billing cycle, over 360gb!  That adds up quick!  I've setup a daily cron to fetch the latest ip ranges from ipdeny -> my iptables to block most European countries along with Russia/China, based on the IP's.  Appreciate any details you might be able to find!"
36925,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hello,  I do want to point out that Amazon does not monitor your traffic until it starts to become a problem for AWS itself. That said, we generally recommend that you make use of IPtables (Or Windows Firewall) to protect your instances.   Here is a script that I employ on my own instance and you may use as an example:  sysctl -w net/ipv4/tcp_syncookies=""1""  iptables -F  iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT iptables -P FORWARD DROP  iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT iptables -A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT  iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,FIN SYN,FIN -j DROP iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN,RST -j DROP iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,FIN,PSH SYN,FIN,PSH -j DROP iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,FIN,RST SYN,FIN,RST -j DROP iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --tcp-flags SYN,FIN,RST,PSH SYN,FIN,RST,PSH -j DROP iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --tcp-flags FIN FIN -j DROP iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --tcp-flags ALL NONE -j DROP iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --tcp-flags ALL ALL -j DROP iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --tcp-flags ALL FIN,URG,PSH -j DROP iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --tcp-flags ALL SYN,RST,ACK,FIN,URG -j DROP  iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --dport ssh -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --dport http -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT  iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --dport ssh -j DROP iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --dport http -j DROP  This script assumes that your Security Groups are dropping all ICMP packets and that the only ports you have allowed are 80 and 22 in this example.  (YOU MUST TEST YOUR CUSTOM SCRIPT ON A TEST SERVER FIRST. AWS takes no responsibility if you lock yourself out of your instance.) The above example will DROP many of the known bad packets and spoofing syn attacks.  To limit traffic, you could add: iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -m state --state NEW -m recent --set --name HTTP; iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -m state --state NEW -m recent --update --seconds 60 --hitcount 20 --rttl --name HTTP -j DROP"
36925,Amazon EC2 V1,"Thanks!  Not to beat a dead horse, but can abilities such as these be added to the roadmap for security groups?  It becomes tedious to manage large amounts of rules on a per host basis.  Any insight why AWS even allows this type of traffic past their perimeter firewalls whatsoever (regarding syn / fin attacks, specifically)?"
36925,Amazon EC2 V1,"""iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -m state --state NEW -m recent --set --name HTTP; iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -m state --state NEW -m recent --update --seconds 60 --hitcount 20 --rttl --name HTTP -j DROP"" seemed to block the load balancer to me, as it looks like all requests are coming from the load balancer."
36924,Amazon EC2 V1,"Network problems today in US-East Starting around noon time (pacific) this afternoon, we noticed some severe slowness between all of our servers in the US-East region. This caused all kinds of problems and alerts on our systems, until the problem magically went away around 2:30pm Pacific. Now, the network is even faster than it was before this outage. I suspect some sort of networking change or upgrade was occurring within AWS's infrastructure, but I have no way to test or validate this. Did anyone else experience slowness in US-East around this time frame today?  Thanks,  Philip"

36922,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hello,  You will need to make sure that the ports are open in your security groups on your instance.

Best,  Matt J"
36922,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi,  I didn't use any database. The only server I need to use is Tomcat so I add the 8080 port to the security group. However I still cannot visit my website..."
36922,Amazon EC2 V1,There are a couple of things to check. Some of this depends which OS you are running.  1. You are connecting to the public IP/DNS of your instance. 2. The security group has port 8080 open 3. The instance internal firewall is off or has port 8080 open (Redhat often has restrictive iptables config and windows firewall can sometimes cause problems) 4. Tomcat is running and bound to listen on all IP addresses. (Some versions of linux might restrict which ips a service can be bound to by default.)
36922,Amazon EC2 V1,"HI venusameng,  Please share the instance ID (e.g. i-1234abcd) with us so we can investigate this further. Additionally, assuming you are using a linux instance, please share the output of the following commands from your instance:   netstat -antup | grep 8080 iptables -L   The above commands will tell us if a service is listening on 8080/TCP and allowed through the firewall (i.e. iptables)."
36922,Amazon EC2 V1,"i-fbef229c By the way, I used windows instance.."
36922,Amazon EC2 V1,I can confirm that your security groups are setup correctly but the instance is not responding to telnet connection to 8080/TCP:   telnet ec2-23-21-88-35.compute-1.amazonaws.com 8080 Trying 23.21.88.35...   This indicates either a firewall dropping incoming traffic on 8080/TCP or the application is not listening on this port. I would suggest following the suggested provided by D. Johansson as at this point we have no visibility inside your instance due to privacy and security reasons.  Let me know if you have any more questions.

I choose the   Platform: LINUX instance type: m1.small Offering Type: Heavy Utilization Term: 3 Years Quantity: 1  It shows Total one time fee :$300 , Hourly $0.013  So is that mean I will be paying just $300 for running my instance for 3 years without having pay for I/O Request, Instance per hour?  Just confuse with the term Total one time fee? Is it really one time?  Edited by: Wanderlust on Apr 5, 2012 1:13 AM"
36921,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hello Wanderlust,  Amazon EC2 reserved instances (""RIs"") allow you to make a one-time payment and receive a reduced hourly rate for a corresponding on-demand instance.  After the one-time payment for an instance, that instance is reserved for you, and guarantees you capacity whenever you need it. You are under no obligation and you may choose to run an instance for the discounted usage rate for the duration of your term.  Heavy Utilization RIs are most appropriate for steady-state production workloads that will be always running, so you commit to the entire duration of the Reserved Instance term. With this RI, you pay a higher upfront payment than Medium Utilization RIs and the lowest hourly usage fee. Note that you are charged the low hourly rate for every hour of the Reserved Instance term you purchase, regardless of whether an applicable DB instance is running.   Based on your scenario, if the instance you purchase is a Heavy Utilization, with $300 upfront, a 3 year term, at $0.013 per hour it will cost you: $113.88 per year x 3 years = $341.64 for the hourly + $300 upfront = $641.64 over the 3 year span.   I hope this information helps!  Kit B."

36908,Amazon EC2 V1,"ELB: need 2 instances in 2 zones for high availability? I have a web app, I want it to stay up in the event that an availability zone goes down.  I also want it to stay up in the event that any single instance goes down.  From what I've figured out, I believe this means that I need to have two instances in zone X and two instances in zone Y.  That way zone X can go down and all traffic will go to zone Y, or any single server can go down and its partner in that zone can handle its traffic.  I'd prefer to have one server in zone X and one server in zone Y, but from my experiments, if the server in zone X goes down, 50% of the traffic is still routed to zone X which has no healthy instances.  Is this correct?  Is there any way to meet my requirements by using less than four instances?  Thanks."
36908,Amazon EC2 V1,"I believe this can work, but the exact ELB implementation details are not known. When all instances in a particular zone become unhealthy, the ELB can either forward the request to another zone or completely refuse to serve it. I tried this out a while ago, and based on my observations it seemed like the ELB did the right thing. When I forced the single instance into an unhealthy state, the ELB forwarded requests ending up in that zone to the other one instead. It even worked when I removed the instance completely."
36908,Amazon EC2 V1,"This is true. You can take advantage of this ELB feature and only put one host in each zone. I'm not sure I'd recommend it, though.  Whether it suits your needs depends on the level of availability that you need.  The reason I say this is that it takes some time for ELB to recognize that an instance is failed (depending on the frequency of health checks that you have configured and on the number of failed health checks before an instance is considered unhealthy).  If you also want to keep running when your unhealthy instance responds successfully to health checks but is serving traffic unusually slowly, you'll need at least two instances in each zone.  In short, more instances in more zones will give better availability, but you can make due with one instance in each of two zones.  Note that high availability and sticky sessions don't really go well together. For the best availability story, you'll want to make sure that any of your instances can serve any of your traffic and turn off stickiness.  Regards, Paul Coleman"

In case you are using Windows, I believe you will need to go with the first option. The image/snapshot data will be kept until you explicitly delete it. Creating new backups using either of these methods is a manual operation. In case you wish to automate it, you can use the EC2 API, or a third party service such as Skeddly (haven't tried them myself).  http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Tutorial_CreateImage.html http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-creating-snapshot.html"

It is possible to add an extra network interface when using VPC, which means you get an additional private IP address. Adding a second public IP address won't work though.

36903,Amazon EC2 V1,In my experience a situation like that means your instance is running out of memory and may be crashing because of it.  The spike in I/O may be memory usage faulting to swap space.
36903,Amazon EC2 V1,This is back to being a problem. Instance is completely unresponsive.
36903,Amazon EC2 V1,"I see you said it resolved itself, but when this happens again... Issue a reboot in the AWS console.  That will force a restart from the host because your instance has crashed due to memory or swap,I/O as someone mentioned.  Edited by: bfaws on Apr 5, 2012 11:48 AM"
36902,Amazon EC2 V1,"SMTP Issue? We use our instance to host an online e-commerce site.  It is still being beta tested, and up until now we've had no issues with sending out emails from the server - super low traffic at this point (just a few emails a day).  Emails sent out from the instance have all arrived instantly.  However, right now there is substantial lag between when postfix declares the email sent and when the email is received.  I have verified this lag with multiple email services (Gmail, our in-house mail server which is usually instant, etc.).  Right now it has been half an hour since the last emails were sent out and I still have not received it at any of our test email accounts.  I have applied for the lift on the email sending limits, just in case this is the cause of the issue, however I have not received any sort of notification from AWS that we have hit our maximum.  Is there any way for me to determine if we are being throttled, or if there is some other issue?  If it is some other issue, is anyone aware of any current oddness with SMTP and EC2 within the last few hours?  Thanks."
36901,Amazon EC2 V1,"Problem attaching EBS Volume to my instance Hi,  I'm having hard time understanding how EBS Volume work in  EC2 instance.

Thanks in advance!"
36901,Amazon EC2 V1,"I'm a Windows guy, (Unix System V a long time ago), and in Windows once we mount an EBS volume it is really just raw media.  The first thing we do is enable it, flag it as a partition, and format it with an NTFS filesystem of our specification.  Do you need to ""partition"" and ""format"" the media?  James"
36901,Amazon EC2 V1,"I google a bit and I find that I need to format it, but when I execute:  sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvda1 mke2fs 1.41.14 (22-Dec-2010) /dev/xvda1 is mounted; will not make a filesystem here!  But /dev/xvda1 is not in  /etc/fstab   And what is the 160gb disk that show the sudo fdisk -l  More Information: I have a m1.small instance  Thanks for your answer!"
36901,Amazon EC2 V1,"Your EBS volume is mounted to root with the device /dev/xvda1. This is considered your root volume. EBS backed volumes can have instance storage enabled also. Some AMI's do this automatically, while you can enable it at launch with the command line tools. Often this is mounted to /mnt, but it could be other places.  Instance storage should not be considered persistent if you ever need to stop/start your instance. Its tied to the physical host and a stop/start operation will disassociate your instance with its host and assign a new one when its starts again."
36901,Amazon EC2 V1,"So, let me see if I understand  The 8 gb is my main disk, all what I have install in my instance is in this 8gb.  The 160gb automatically  ""come"" with my type of instance and is in /mnt BUT, this is tied to the instance, if I terminate it, this data will be destroyed  Is this correct?  So do I need to create another volume to persist data that I want not to be tied with a unique instance... For example, I need to save images and they have to be visible for all my webservers.  Thanks very much for your answer!"
36901,Amazon EC2 V1,"Instance storage does not get automatically added with all AMI's. Because many AMI's are provided by the community, some choose to enable it by default.  Terminate also means something other than stop/start. Even EBS volumes can get deleted on terminate if the delete on terminate flag is set.   In ec2 you can do the following actions:  Restart : Resets your instance, but keeps it associated with the same physical host server.  Stop/Start : Available for EBS backed instances. Stop will disassociate the instance from its host, start will assign the instance to a new host out of the pool. Instance storage is lost because your instance moves to a new host.  Terminate: Destory the instance and ebs volumes with delete on terminate flag set. This action is not reversible."

36897,Amazon EC2 V1,"backing up an m1.small /dev/sdb /mnt volume??? I noticed that the 64bit Ubuntu m1.small instance has a non-EBS sdb /mnt volume.  The sda1 volume is EBS and shows up as a volume in Snapshots, sure would like to snapshot sdb.  /dev/sda1             7.9G  4.1G  3.5G  55% / none                  811M  116K  811M   1% /dev none                  861M     0  861M   0% /dev/shm none                  861M   72K  861M   1% /var/run none                  861M     0  861M   0% /var/lock none                  861M     0  861M   0% /lib/init/rw /dev/sdb              147G  188M  140G   1% /mnt  Do I have to create a separate equavelant size EBS volume and rsync the sdb /mnt volume to it?  I'm a bit confused as to why the sdb is not EBS.  I would think it would be best to just create an EBS volume, mount it then ln -s things like /var/www and /var/lib to it.  Then take snapshots of this new EBS volume.  Sure would be a waste of space not using /dev/sdb /mnt at all though.  Whats the best practice for this?  Many thanks for any direction at all.  Troy"
36897,Amazon EC2 V1,"/dev/sdb is instance storage. Instance storage (tied to the physical host) is not persistent. It wont survive if you stop your instance.  It also looks like you don't have much data on /mnt. If you have anything important on it, just move it out to the root volume and be careful about using it in the future."
36897,Amazon EC2 V1,"Thank you for the clarification.  I'm still puzzled as to why a 150Gig /mnt ""temporary"" instance is made available.  So what your saying is that if I reboot, anything in the 150Gig /mnt dir is blown away, same as the sda1 /tmp directory.  Correct?  Why would anyone actually use the 150Gig /mnt dir knowing they would lose their data upon reboot?"
36897,Amazon EC2 V1,"Keep in mind that reboot and start/stop mean different things. You would not loose data on reboot, the instance stays associated with its host. But with stop/start, the instance gets moved to a new host. Since instance storage is connected to the host, it would not transfer.  Some EBS backed AMI's have instance storage enabled by default, while you can enable it on launch if you need it. The use cases for it are somewhat limited, but its best for storing data that is  otherwise replicated or if you need to store a large amount of temporary data when doing processing for example."

36894,Amazon EC2 V1,Hello Igor  Yes it is up and running again.  For about 3.5 hours it was stopped with an insufficient capacity preventing start...  Was there an underlying technical issue?  Did you do something that provided the capacity to start again?  If so thanks!!  Considering this is a reserved instance I was hoping a stop and start would have more priority and I wouldn't be at the back of the line so to speak.  In the future if I need to stop and start what should I expect and how should I go about doing it?  Thanks  Kevin

36892,Amazon EC2 V1,"EC2 RHEL Instance Mistake Hi! We purchased 4 reserved instances and tried to deploy RHEL on them, not knowing that RHEL doesn't count towards regular reserved instances and is priced differently. We ran them for a few weeks, and then we migrated them to Amazon AMI's as soon as we saw our bill. Is there any way that we can have those hourly rates adjusted and reimbursed for the time that our RHEL instances were running as if they were regular Amazon AMI's running as reserved instances?  Thanks,  -Ben A."

I cannot ssh into my instances because I can't use the Control Panel to add valid IPs.  And so on.  We have chosen the cost of AWS -- and recommend AWS highly inside the Drupal community over co-location and other options,  because of a variety of value calculations.    One of those is that you will be reliable and responsive within reasonable times.    What if one of our client instances was offline?  I hope my point is made."

36887,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi,  due to the urgency of the matter, i have tried many attempts to recover my data and is currently setting up another instance.  As you can see, i created about 7 instances and some EBS today to test everything up actually.  The problem is not due to the EIP but its because the sshd is not able to start due to some errors which i cannot identify. It seems to be due to a particular EBS volume (vol-e287e788) i had. If i mount it to any instance, it will cause the instance to become inaccessible.  So anyway, i have moved on and hopefully no such problem again in future.  Thanks for your email anyway"

You can then use event viewer to try to figure out what went wrong, and to try and repair the OS.  To start event viewer from command line use the command eventvwr.  If you would like to try this option please make sure to launch the new instance in the same Availability zone. Also as a precaution you may want to take a snapshot of the instance before detaching the drive from it.

I don't see any issues on the host that could cause this. Looks like you did stop/start the instance because normally, I would suggest you do in this situation. The only option left is to stop this instance, detach its root volume, take a snapshot of it (for backup) and then attach that volume to a running instance to look into it or possibly copy data over.

It is instance i-3210cf50 in US EAST-1  We've rebooted, then  stop/started it again and no improvement.  We'll probably replace it but want to be on record that it seems to be a general problem.

36870,Amazon EC2 V1,i'm having this problem too..did you find a solution?
36870,Amazon EC2 V1,You will need connectivity to the internet or setup a local NTP server on your network which is able to sync time with public NTP servers.   I have also provided instructions for Windows in a recent thread about syncing time: https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=333982&#333982  Please let us know if you have any additional questions.

36869,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi jchentrx,  Can you confirm that your instance is syncing time from the NTP servers? Please ensure that you are using at least 4 NTP servers. If they are not already using at least 4 NTP sources, then you should do the following:  w32tm /config /manualpeerlist:""0.north-america.pool.ntp.org 1.north-america.pool.ntp.org 2.north-america.pool.ntp.org 3.north-america.pool.ntp.org"" /update   You can verify that they are (or are not) in sync with an NTP source by doing the following:  w32tm /monitor /computers:0.north-america.pool.ntp.org   You can use this command to force a sync and cause the time provider to get fresh IP addresses from the underlying DNS source (this is the command to script occurring at some frequency):  w32tm /resync /rediscover   I hope this helps but please let us know if you have any more questions."
36868,Amazon EC2 V1,"Why are my EC2 status checks displaying ""1/2 checks passed""? Here is my scenario:  I have couple of VPCs in different regions that are part of our office network. To resolve some issues, I created two new VPCs with different subnets Since I have few production servers (one webserver and one DC) that I want to re-use (and not reconfigure from scratch), I did the following:  1.	Create Image (EBS AMI) from the running instances of my EC2s 2.	Create Image from Snapshot 3.	Launch Instance 4.	Start the instance  In both cases, the status shows ""1/2 checks passed"".  What am I missing?"
36868,Amazon EC2 V1,"There are two types of checks: System reachability and Instance reachability. If you select your instance and switch to the ""Status Checks"" tab, you will see more information. I assume the Instance reachability check is failing. Something might prevent this instance from booting as expected. If you open the ""Instance Actions"" menu, there is an option called ""Get System Log"". It might provide some clues as to why this is happening.  I'm a bit curious about the second step. In the first step, you created a new EBS AMI, which can be used when launching new instances. Creating an image from a snapshot is basically the same thing, but it is harder to get it right. If the parameters aren't in order, the AMI might not boot as expected. The first step should be all you need. It is very unlikely that an AMI created via ""Create Image (EBS AMI)"" won't work."
36868,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi D.  Well since I posted this issue, things have changed a little:  In the East region, the new instance now is showing 2 / 2 check passed In the west region, it still shows the 1 / 2 check passed and you are correct the instance reachability is failing. The system log shows the following:  o	3/29/2012 8:43:39 PM: Waiting for meta-data accessibility... o	3/29/2012 8:47:21 PM: Waiting for meta-data accessibility...  One thing that I forgot to add, the two EC2 do not display any kernel and ram disk id (we chose default when we set it up) so for the new instance, I could not choose anything.  You are correct about my âuselessâ extra steps so for the one failing, I recreated the instance with only the first step and I am still getting the 1 / 2 check passed result. The log is similar: 3/29/2012 10:00:44 PM: Waiting for meta-data accessibility... 3/29/2012 10:07:08 PM: Still waiting for meta-data accessibility... 3/29/2012 10:12:50 PM: Still waiting for meta-data accessibility... 3/29/2012 10:14:56 PM: Waiting for meta-data accessibility...  Also, regarding the instance that is passing the two steps, I cannot RDP to it using an elastic IP address I assign to it (I opened all the TCP port for the test). Do you think that even the 2 checks passed, I should rebuild it?"
36868,Amazon EC2 V1,"Make sure to use the AMIs created via ""Create Image (EBS AMI)"". That eliminates any errors introduced in the second step.  I'm not very familiar with Windows, but if you search the forums, there are quite a few threads concerning the meta-data accessibility issue. This one looks especially interesting in case you are using multiple network interfaces. You will hopefully be able to find some useful information if you look around a bit. If each new instance fails with the same error, it seems reasonable to assume there is something wrong with the AMI, possibly caused by the configuration (such as multiple network interfaces). Based on what we discussed in your other thread, it sounds like you just have a single subnet though.  If you are unable to connect to an instance passing both checks, you could post the instance id(s) here. An instance id looks something like ""i-xxxxxxxx"". That would allow AWS to look into it."

Since we shut down the AMIs every day we had to spend some time to bring the oracle AMIs back up and running with the new IP addresses.

Did anybody face the same probelm or Does anybody have a solution to this problem?  Things that I tried are, to use the elastic IP address, but if I use the elastic IP address on the DB tier the Oracle service wouldn't start because it looks for the port (the port that oracle service needs to listen to, 1521 by default) on the machine and port obviously can't be on a device that is holding the elastic IP address so it fails at about 50% of the starting the oracle service.

Attach the newly created volume to the instance. Start the instance. 5. Depending on the operating system, you may see the expanded volume size or you may have to run a utility to extend the partition so it uses the extended unpartitioned space now available.

36856,Amazon EC2 V1,"That load balancer has been deleted, so I can't see what is wrong, but I'll hazard a few guess based on what I saw: 1. It's in VPC, so you need to make sure that the security group on the ELB allows ingress on port 80 and port 443. 2. You need to make sure the instances are in the same Availability Zone as you used for the ELB.  Since in VPC the relationship is multiple subnets per AZ, you need to make sure that you register instances a subnet that is in the same AZ as the subnet you attached ELB to. 3. Assuming #1 and #2 are ok, make sure that traffic is allowed to go from the ELB subnet to the subnet where the instances are located.  You could double check this by launching an instance in the same subnet as ELB and then trying to directly make a request to the instance that is registered with ELB. 4. Your health checks could be misconfigured so that instances are never healthy.  There are a lot of other possibilities, so if there is another active ELB to look at, we can probably be more accurate."

36841,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi,  Your volume (vol-94a0eefd) experienced a failure due to multiple failures of the underlying hardware components and we were unable to recover it. Unfortunately, this is the reason you are unable to start this instance or create a snapshot of this volume.  Although EBS volumes are designed for reliability, backed by multiple physical drives, we are still exposed to durability risks caused by concurrent hardware failures of multiple components, before our systems are able to restore the redundancy. We publish our durability expectations on the EBS detail page here (http://aws.amazon.com/ebs).  We recommend recovering your volume from your most recent EBS snapshot, and we apologize for this data loss and the adverse impact for your business.  Regards, Chaitan B.  Edited by: Chaitan@AWS on Apr 1, 2012 9:05 AM"
36841,Amazon EC2 V1,"Unfortunately, it does not look like our most recent snapshot of this volume is very recent.  I did not realize that the snapshot was not regularly updated.

Unfortunately, for your security, we do not store any customer data outside of your EBS volumes or take backups of your EBS volumes beyond the normal redundancy measures (which have failed at this point). We recommend taking frequent snapshots of your critical data, but I guess that is of no help to you now. Again, I'm very sorry for this data loss. There is nothing further I can do to recover this volume.  Chaitan B."

36841,Amazon EC2 V1,"OK, understandable.  Can you help with getting these volumes detached from the stopped instance though?  I'm trying to detach the bad root volume (vol-94a0eefd) and the other 75gb volume (vol-ae959ec6)."
36841,Amazon EC2 V1,"Just saw your last message.  The problem with creating a replacement instance is that I don't have an AMI of the instance that has the bad volume attached(another pleasant surprise).  I'd like to get the bad volume detached, create an AMI of the stopped instance, then launch a replacement instance and attach a new root volume created from our old snaphot.  again, thanks for your help!"
36841,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi,  1) I don't see any issue with your volume vol-ae959ec6. Have you tried a Force Detach?  2) You will be unable to take an AMI of an instance without the root volume. I recommend launching a replacement instance from a public AMI or your own AMI that closely matches this instance and proceed with replacing the root volume as you intended to do.  Regards, Chaitan B."
36841,Amazon EC2 V1,"So, to be clear, is it not possible to detach the failed root volume: vol-94a0eefd ?"
36841,Amazon EC2 V1,"Since the instance is stopped, it should be possible to detach the root volume.  However, since the volume is failed, you'll likely need to issue two force detach requests.  If you have the EC2 command line API tools installed on your local computer, then this can be accomplished by issuing the following command twice:  ec2-detach-volume vol-94a0eefd --force  I've also created a parallel internal request to have the volume attachment state adjusted on your behalf since the volume failed.  That being said, the above command run twice should enable you to free up the volume, as well.  Best Regards, -Cindy"
36841,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi Cindy,   Unfortunately, making two force detach requests did not cause the volume to detach.  We tried last night and this morning without any luck.  Any other ideas?  Thanks, Paul"
36841,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi Paul,  Thank you trying that.  Double force detaching a stuck volume generally corrects the attachment state.  I'm sorry to hear it wasn't able to here.  However, the internal request I initiated to have the state corrected was able to be processed successfully.  I see the volume is no longer affiliated with an instance.  Please respond back if this is not what you're seeing from your perspective.  Thanks, -Cindy"
36841,Amazon EC2 V1,"Thanks Cindy.  Is there any possibility that the data on this detached volume can be recovered?  Does not appear it's possible to take a snapshot of it.  Also, is it possible we can get a credit on our account for the past few days. We've been spinning up instances / taking snapshots like crazy trying to get things back to normal.    Thanks, Paul"
36841,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hello Paul Dougherty,  You should received separated message from our EBS team about volume ""vol-94a0eefd"", however as I can see that volume unfortunately can't be restored.

36837,Amazon EC2 V1,"DeleteOnTermination flag in Auto Scaling taking no effect for extra device I have an Auto Scaling launch configuration for an AMI with two block devices: /dev/sda1 and /dev/sdf.

Here's my setup:    AMI AMI ID: ami-74bc0d75 Block Devices: /dev/sda1=snap-68c25d05:10:false, /dev/sdf=snap-9cc35cf1:25:false  Launch config $ as-create-launch-config LC_NAME   --image-id ami-74bc0d75   --block-device-mapping ""/dev/sda1=snap-68c25d05:10:true""   --block-device-mapping ""/dev/sdf=snap-9cc35cf1:25:true""   ...  $ as-describe-launch-configs --show-long LAUNCH-CONFIG,LC_NAME,ami-74bc0d75,m2.xlarge,KEY_NAME,(nil),(nil),{/dev/sda1=snap-68c25d05:10},GROUP_NAME,2012-04-04T04:48:37.039Z,...

Is this a bug, or I'm doing it the wrong way?  Another possible bug: the command ""as-describe-launch-configs --show-long"" shows there's only one device mapping for the launch config."
36837,Amazon EC2 V1,"As a workaround, setting the ""Delete on termination"" flag to true at the AMI level has worked for me. Still, I believe setting the flag in the launch configuration should override that behavior. So the question still holds: Am I specifying the flag correctly with as-create-launch-config? Shouldn't it be overriding the flag of the AMI?  Note: to modify the flag of an AMI's block device mapping, the following steps were needed.   Modify the flag of the instance that I use to create the AMI. You may need to launch a new one if you don't keep an instance around. ec2-modify-instance-attribute -b /dev/sdf=:true i-XXXXXXXX  Create a new AMI from that instance. Re-create the launch config with the new AMI ID."
36836,Amazon EC2 V1,"Long e2fsck run times Hello,  I have been shifting between micro and small instances for parsing large batches of data. Along with that, I have also enlarged an EBS volume several times and have noticed that e2fsck seems to take a very long period of time. More recently, for example, e2fsck had run on a 500GB volume for roughly 4 hours on a small instance before I decided to cancel the process and revert the instance to a micro and re-run the check, since I was planning on letting it run overnight - as I am still under the Free Tier. Much to my surprise though, it took less than 2 hours this time around before it completed. With a 300GB volume a little while back, a micro instance took about 5 hours for the process to complete.  I am working under educational grant credits and would therefore prefer to only allocate as much EBS space as I would need within a short timespan so that I can minimize cost - I'd rather not allocate an enormous volume to simply to avoid multiple e2fsck runs. Because I'll probably require increasingly larger volumes though, I am worried that the check process will waste too much time. Similarly, snapshots seem to be taking a long time to complete as well. the last snapshot that I had done was on the 300GB volume, which took roughly 7 hours; the one before that, for a 100GB volume, required about 4 hours.  I'd like to know whether or not these processing times are normal. I'm a bit fortunate that I'm not under a strict time constraint to complete the parsing, though it's an enormous nuisance to have so much downtime every time I would like to increase a volume's size.  Any information regarding this is greatly appreciated!  Edited by: W. Rezie on Apr 3, 2012 9:05 PM"
36835,Amazon EC2 V1,"Find out instance owner Hi,  I have a little question, maybe there is somebody who can help me out. I am writing an App that runs on EC2. This App will be used by more than one EC2-Users/EC2-Accounts.  Now my problem is the following: It would be nice (e.g. for licensing reasons) if the App could find out which AWS-account started the instance.  For example: The App knows the AWS-Account n. (e.g. 2116-9465-xxxx), or something other from the person who started the instance.  I need only a difference in a variable, so that my App knows which AWS-Account started the App. If there is no way to find that out I have to search for an other solution (license key or something like this)  I DON'T need to know from which ""specific"" AWS-Account the App was started. I need only to have the possibilty to GROUP the Instances, so that I know:  5 Instances were started by an AWS-Account 1 and 3 Instances were started by an AWS-Account 2.

36835,Amazon EC2 V1,"EC2 provides instance metadata, but unfortunately the account id is not available.   http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/index.html?AESDG-chapter-instancedata.html  Would DevPay work for you?  http://aws.amazon.com/devpay/"
36835,Amazon EC2 V1,"Thank you very much! I think this is the solution:  --- This shows an example of returning comma-separated user-supplied data ---  When a user starts an instance he can provide ""user data"" in a form field (e.g. 'user1'). So it should be possible to get this user data in my App with  GET http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data  Is this correct?  And then it's possible to make an ""if ($userdata == 'user1') { // do what you have to do for user1 }  This should be possible..."
36835,Amazon EC2 V1,The user data can be used to pass information to the instance. It will contain whatever the user decided to supply when the instance was launched.
36835,Amazon EC2 V1,"That's everything I need.  I say to my users, that they have to pass their costumer id as the user data.  If they don't pass a valid costumer ID the App will not work and if they pass a costumer ID from an other user they will pay the AWS costs and their instances work for the other user.   So thay have no cause to cheat and if they cheat they have themselves to blame.  Am I right or do you see a problem in my logic?  Edited by: sourceweb on Oct 7, 2011 7:52 AM"

36834,Amazon EC2 V1,"How to understand CPU utilisation on a t1.micro instance - Wordpress Hi,  I'm running an instance of Wordpress on a 64bit Redhat instance. I'm the only person using the site at the moment and the CPU utilisation is showing 60% at times - consistently over 40%... I am certainly experiencing slow loading (up to 20 seconds on some pages).   I've used the 'sum' drop down value on the CPU utilisation and it goes well over 200%   Are these indicators that I should be using a bigger instance? Or am I just looking for big numbers and finding them?  I certainly would love to know if there's a chance that upgrading will prevent the super slow pages (there's nothing in the pages to justify the slow load) it just appears like I'm waiting for the site to do it's thing.  Any suggestions or direction would be much appreciated!   Thanks, Rich  Edited by: fotoura on Apr 3, 2012 5:53 PM"
36834,Amazon EC2 V1,"Well, you can execute ps -aux to see which processes are eating up your cpu usage."
36834,Amazon EC2 V1,"There are some things you can do like installing php-apc or using a better optimized web server (nginx or apache 2.4). Wordpress also has some caching plugins that can help.  If that doesnt help enough, then you may want to consider a larger instance. Micro instances had a burstable cpu profile which will limit the CPU usage to much less than 1 ecu most of the time.  Are you running RHEL on demand instances? RHEL licencing adds $0.06 per hour regardless of which size instance you are using. Which makes a micro instance cost 4 times more than the base price."
36833,Amazon EC2 V1,"Amazon Linux 2012.03 Ruby dependencies not updated correctly I've been running Amazon Linux 2011.09, and today found that my deploys for new nodes were failing because Chef was throwing a segfault.  I found this ticket (http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-3011?focusedCommentId=22906#comment-22906) on Chef's issue tracker.  After investigating the problem for a bit, I discovered that my Ruby versions were slightly different on machines deployed yesterday versus today â 1.8.7.357-1.10.amzn1 on older machines, 1.8.7.357-1.16.amzn1 on newer ones.  This was how I discovered that a new version of Amazon Linux had been released.  I use cloudinit/cfn-init to install ruby-devel when bringing up nodes.  I figured that ruby-devel must have been updated, and an updated ruby was specified as a dependency, so it was installed as well, which is why I see 1.16 on the newer machines.  The segfaults disappear if I run a `yum update -y` on a machine and then reboot it.  Given these facts, it appears that there is at least one package that needs to be updated when ruby is updated to the 2012.03 version that is not being updated.  You'll need to update the list of dependencies for Ruby in order to quash this problem."

36811,Amazon EC2 V1,"console issues? false ""stopped"" listing, IP & security group disappear Hi, I have a t1.micro instance (running Amazon Linux AMI) that I'm using as a Web server, among other things. Its default security group (quicklaunch) had HTTP access enabled. I assigned it an Elastic IP address. I used my own domain name provider to point at the Elastic IP. Everything worked great, and it still seems to be working.  BUT today I happened to look at the AWS console and I saw that my instance was listed as stopped.  The instance is not listed as having an Elastic IP address (when I click on ""Elastic IPs"" it says I have no Elastic IPs). My changes to the quicklaunch security group (according to the AWS console) have been erased: HTTP is not enabled.  Yet this management console information is not true. My server is running. It works fine. It appears that AWS is showing me a phantom instance of some kind that does not refer to the actual instance.  My only clue as to what is going on is that I now have a new security group that I did not create named after the instance name plus a long identifier like: ""-1ONKDQ4D8CXNV"".  This mystery security group has HTTP enabled.  It appears to be the security group that is actually working and applied to my running Web server instance that I can no longer see in the console.

We have not heard of any issues with customer running ruby 1.9.  The customers that I know that are using ruby1.9 are using RVM to install it.  However, there are no system level scripts that require ruby, so upgrading the system level ruby to ruby1.9 shouldn't have any negative effects to the AMI.  It is possible that some of the extra packages available in the repositories that rely on ruby (such as puppet), might break with a system level upgrade of ruby.    Let us know if you run into specific issues or have any further questions."
36804,Amazon EC2 V1,"I have a growing concern with the outdated ruby 1.8.7 package by having to upgrade to 1.9.3 for each instance I create.  Currently there are only 3 options to install 1.9.3 on Amazon Linux... Install via RVM, Rbenv, or compile manually.  Depending on the instance type, any of these options can take anywhere from 15 - 30min to compile.   Normally this wouldn't be that much of an issue, but if utilizing CloudFormation with any bootstrapping scripts, the stack will take a very long time to deploy due to Ruby compiling at launch.  If time is of the essence then CloudFormation might not be your best option. Consider creating your own AMI to work around this constraint...  Let's hope 1.9.3 becomes available to Amazon Linux - after all ruby 1.9.1 was release in January 2009. If no one is complaining by now, it's probably safe to update YUM."

I have 50 stopped instances. If I build a list of those 50 instance-IDs and try to start them..  ** myRequest = new StartInstancesRequest()   .withInstanceIds(instanceList);  ec2.startInstances(myRequest); **  .. it is fairly unreliable. About 30 or so might start. I'm not saying the rest start a little while later, I'm saying they remain in the 'stopped' state.  On the other hand, if those same 50 instances are previously in the 'running' state, then stopping them always works reliably..  ** myRequest = new StopInstancesRequest()   .withInstanceIds(instanceList);  ec2.stopInstances(myRequest); **  .. is always very reliable -- all 50 eventually transition into the 'stopped' state.  I need to be able to rely on the 'start' methodology to work properly too! Is there a different API call or sequence that I should be doing?

After several minutes, ec2 seems to give up and put it in the ""stopped"" state.

So when my end users makes a request to the application the request wil be on HTTPS, since they access the ELB, now, ELB internally redirects it on HTTP to the tomcat server. In tomcat my application is protected through Spring Security and if the request is for a protected resource and the user is not logged in user is redirected to the configured login page. Now, this redirection to the end user will be over HTTP, since the tomcat server had got the request originally from the ELB as HTTP. This will now lead to a 404 since I have not configured for inward traffic on HTTP.  How do we resolve this issue? Is the only option to have HTTPS both on the enduser-ELB and from ELB-tomcat or am i missing some thing here?"

36787,Amazon EC2 V1,"You can think of EC2 instances as regular Linux servers, albeit running in a more restricted network environment compared to what you might be familiar with. Failing over to another instance needs to be performed by moving the public IP address to the other server using the EC2 API. AWS offers a load balancing service, but I'm afraid it might not be very useful in this scenario. More specifically, it doesn't support UDP, and I believe Asterisk requires everything to be ""sticky"" as well.  In general, you can take advantage of your existing skills in the cloud as well. Keep in mind that the network environment is more restricted though. Things might have changed since I worked with Asterisk professionally a couple of years ago. It is possible that there is new functionality which would make this easier. Failover is most likely much simpler to set up compared to load balancing. A basic failover setup might involve a hot standby instance, an Elastic IP address, and some custom logic to keep the configuration in sync."

36783,Amazon EC2 V1,"Migrating legacy Auto Scaling Triggers new, CloudWatch Alarms Migrating legacy Auto Scaling Triggers to the new, CloudWatch Alarm based scaling system  The new automatic scaling system, based on CloudWatch Alarms, provides a much more flexible system for adjusting the size of your EC2 fleet to optimize cost and accommodate load.The new system is described in detail in:  The Auto Scaling Developer Guide  Auto Scaling does not permit using both a legacy trigger and the new CloudWatch-Alarms-based scaling system on a single Auto Scaling Group. To use the new system you will have to migrate your legacy triggers. Hereâs how to do it.  Install the new Auto Scaling and Cloud Watch CLI packages  Instructions for downloading and installing the two CLI packages can be found here:  Auto Scaling API Tools  Amazon CloudWatch  Once you have both CLI tools working, you can begin the process of migrating a legacy trigger.  An Auto Scaling Group may have, at most, one trigger. That trigger controls both up and down scaling for the group. To replace it youâll need two Alarms and two Scaling Policies.  Describe the trigger  First, describe the legacy trigger. In this example we describe the trigger for an Auto Scaling Group named âTestASGâ  prompt>as-describe-triggers TestASG --show-long --headers Â  DEPRECATED: This command is deprecated and included only to facilitate migration to the new trigger mechanism. You should use this command for migration purposes only.

You will need it to replicate the trigger, below.  Delete the group trigger  Once you have a complete description of the legacy trigger, you must delete it. The Auto Scaling service will not allow you to create a Policy (necessary for the new scaling system) as long as you have a legacy trigger.  In this example, we delete the trigger named âTestTriggerâ in the Auto Scaling Group named âTestASG""  prompt>as-delete-trigger TestTrigger --auto-scaling-group TestASG Â  DEPRECATED: This command is deprecated and included only to facilitate migration to the new trigger mechanism. You should use this command for migration purposes only. Â  Are you sure you want to delete this trigger? [Ny]y Â  OK-Deleted trigger   Create the scaling policies  A scaling policy simply describes the scaling action that the Auto Scaling service will take, on your behalf, when an Alarm fires: adjusting the size of your group. If the breach increment (LOW-BR-INCR, UP-BR-INCR) in the legacy trigger ended with a â%â, the trigger scaled your group by a proportion of the current fleet size. Use the adjustment type âPercentChangeInCapacityâ to create a policy that has the same effect. If the breach increment does not contain a â%â character, the group is scaled by a constant amount each time the trigger fired. Use the adjustment type âChangeInCapacity"" to reproduce this behavior.  In the example, we create two policies, âTestUpâ to scale the group âTestASGâ up by 30% of its size, and âTestDownâ to scale it down by 2 instances.  prompt>as-put-scaling-policy -g TestASG --adjustment=30% --type PercentChangeInCapacity Â  arn:aws:autoscaling:us-east-1:053886847319:scalingPolicy:ac542982-cbeb-4294-891c-a5a941dfa787:autoScalingGroupName/TestASG:policyName/TestUp Â  prompt>as-put-scaling-policy TestDown -g TestASG --adjustment=-2 --type ChangeInCapacity Â  arn:aws:autoscaling:us-east-1:053886847319:scalingPolicy:4ee9e543-86b5-4121-b53b-aa4c23b5bbcc:autoScalingGroupName/TestASG:policyName/TestDown   Again, copy the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) that is returned from each policy creation to a safe place. You will need it as the target for the next step, creating the Cloud Watch Alarm.  Create the alarms  Cloud Watch Alarms are described, in detail in:  The Amazon CloudWatch Developer Guide Alarms  Above, we replicated the action taken by the legacy trigger. In this step, we will replicate the part of the legacy trigger that monitored the metric stream and initiated an action, when the metric breached a threshold.  Where the legacy triggers imposed both an upper and a lower threshold, CloudWatch Alarms have only a single threshold. In order to replicate the behavior of the legacy trigger it is necessary to create two triggers, one for each of the thresholds in the legacy trigger. For the most part, the arguments for the -put-metric-alarm command are taken directly from the description of the legacy trigger, from step 1. There are a couple of changes. First, the --metric-name is called âMEASUREâ in the result from the describe call. Also, the argument for --evaluation-period must be the âBR-DURATIONâ divided by the âPERIODâ. In the example, the legacy triggerâs metric period is 60 and its breach duration is 120, so the correct evaluation period for the new Cloud Watch Alarm is 120/60 = 2.  prompt>mon-put-metric-alarm --alarm-name TestUp --alarm-description âscale upâ --metric-name CPUUtilization --namespace âAWS/EC2â --statistic Average --period 60 --threshold 80 --comparison-operator GreaterThanThreshold --dimensions âAutoScalingGroupName=TestASGâ --evaluation-periods 2 --alarm-actions arn:aws:autoscaling:us-east-1:053886847319:scalingPolicy:ac542982-cbeb-4294-891c-a5a941dfa787:autoScalingGroupName/TestASG:policyName/TestUp Â  OK-Created Alarm Â  prompt>mon-put-metric-alarm --alarm-name TestDown --alarm-description âscale downâ --metric-name CPUUtilization --namespace âAWS/EC2â --statistic Average --period 60 --threshold 20 --comparison-operator LessThanThreshold --dimensions âAutoScalingGroupName=TestASGâ --evaluation-periods 2 --alarm-actions arn:aws:autoscaling:us-east-1:053886847319:scalingPolicy:4ee9e543-86b5-4121-b53b-aa4c23b5bbcc:autoScalingGroupName/TestASG:policyName/TestDown Â  OK-Created Alarm   For the alarm that replicates the upper half of the legacy trigger - the action that scales your group up in response to increased load - you must specify the --comparison-operator âGreaterThanThresholdâ and, as the --target, the ARN for the policy that increases the size of the group. Similarly, to replicate the bottom half of the legacy trigger - the action that scales your group down in response to a decrease in load - you must specify the --comparison-operator âLessThanThresholdâ and, as the --target, the ARN for the policy that decreases the size of the group.

You can send yourself e-mail whenever your group scales. You can scale up in response to a small metric breach but page yourself if the breach is very large."

36783,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi,  Unfortunately you cannot scale on the number of HTTP requests. You can scale using the average latency of your HTTP requests however. To do this you can go to the CloudWatch Console and select ELB metrics from the ""Viewing"" list box. Then you create two alarms that indicate when the system should scale up or scale down. Finally you create two policies for the alarm telling Auto Scaling how many instances to add or remove when these alarms fire.   Hope this helps.   Thomas"

36780,Amazon EC2 V1,"Expected usage for a cron job Hello,  I'm trying to figure out what is considered usage for EC2 and i'm having a bit of trouble.  If i have a very small cron job set to run once a minute and query my SQS data and handle any messages(send push notifications through apple notification server), what sort of usage stats should i be plugging into the EC2 bill calculator?  For actual instance size, i think i'll only have a few php scripts so storage used should be negligible. For usage, This is the part where i'm a bit confused just because i'm not familiar with the whole instanced servers notion... So my thought would be that a very small script running once a minute is going to be a pretty minimal use, we'll say the script takes 2 seconds on a bad day so that would be something like 3% usage for every minute the server is running. Is this a valid assumption, or do i get charged for having the instance ""on"" even if i'm not using the CPU most of the time?  In my mind it would be ideal if i wasn't running my own instance at all and just paying for cpu usage on any given computer to run my cron job. Perhaps this is actually what EC2 ends up being and i'm just misunderstanding it?  Any clarification on this would be greatly appreciated and please feel free to point me to a different AWS service if i've incorrectly chosen EC2 for my use case. -Skyler"
36780,Amazon EC2 V1,It doesn't matter if you use 0% or 100% CPU. You have to pay the full price of an instance anyway if it's up running.
36780,Amazon EC2 V1,Rats looks like i'll need a different solution then as an instance just for a few crons seems like overkill.   Thanks for clarifying the usage for me.
36780,Amazon EC2 V1,Did you ever find a solution for your few cron jobs? I have a similar situation... I need to send an journal type email once a day and don't want to run an ec2 instance for just a single job.  Thanks!
36780,Amazon EC2 V1,"Sorry threejeez i didn't see your reply. I actually ended up doing an EC2 micro server and I'll try to load some other required operations onto it. As my users increase i think the 1 minute cron job will start to put a decent load on the server and i think i can probably task it with some other activities as well.  For your case of only using it once a day, i wonder if there is a way in the AWS console to routinely turn on your ec2 instance for 10 or so minutes once a day to allow your image to boot up and auto fire you desired task and then shut down. If such a thing is possible, the costs should be negligible.   Good Luck!"
36779,Amazon EC2 V1,"How many IPs free? Hello,  I noticed that in the EC2 pricing page it mentions ""No cost for Elastic IP addresses while in use"". Does that mean IP's are free on a unlimited basis? Or are there an limit on that?  Thank you,"
36779,Amazon EC2 V1,"An Elastic IP is free as long as it is associated with a running instance. To make sure IP addresses aren't wasted, you will be charged for any Elastic IPs allocated but not associated with any instance. You can allocate up to five Elastic IP addresses per region. It is possible to request more addresses if needed. However, an EC2 instance can only have a single public IP address at this time."
36779,Amazon EC2 V1,"So, even if I pay/justify for more IP's it is not possible to ""map"" more than one IP to a instance?"
36779,Amazon EC2 V1,"That is correct. As far as I understand, this is something they are working on."

36778,Amazon EC2 V1,"I believe it is only a matter of when, not if, an Australian region will be announced. This is based on public information only. Let's just say interesting things will turn up if you know where to look. AWS can be a bit ""sloppy"" with IP address whois information. It doesn't hurt to watch BGP announcements either.

36775,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi Francisco,  It looks like you're probably referring to case #56558271.  I see in that support case that we supplied directions for how to attempt to correct the EBS attachment state.  Those actions will correct the vast majority of EBS volume attachment state issues.  However, here they did not, so the issue was escalated internally.  I see that the issue appears to have since been resolved.  I'm sorry that this was not able to be completed as quickly as you would have preferred.  Please be aware that AWS Premium Support does not provide a guarantee of time to resolution:  http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/faqs/#fix-sla  That being said, we will do our best to resolve issues as quickly as possible.  It should be noted though that whether you are seeking support through AWS Premium Support or the forums, if you have a failing resource (instance, volume, etc), that it will always be far faster to fail-away form it immediately instead of trying to resurrect it.  This dovetails with the idea of having a fault-tolerant architecture so that failing away becomes a trivial process.  The Amazon EC2 APIs provide the benefit of being able to quickly generate resources on the fly, which makes creating a fault-tolerant architecture even easier.  The other open case you have with us (case #56625661) has been updated with some relevant information on best practices.

36763,Amazon EC2 V1,"Newbie's question - how to start Iâm thinking about moving my server to the Amazon cloud services. However, by some reason I cannot find a sales representative who would guide me. But this is not the point.  The point that Iâm not a high professional, whatever I learned I learned by myself and I have never deal with cloud servers and all terminology is confusing for me. So, if somebody could help me and would guide trough the setup in a simple way I would very appreciate. Now to the point â I would like to move my server to Amazon Clouds with purpose of reducing cost and headaches with hardware and getting better performance for lower cost.  Currently, I have collocated server with Peer1 in Vancouver and currently Iâm paying $1000 per month: 1. Windows 2008 with IIS 7.5 2. SQL 2008 3. RAM 16G â thinking about increasing to 32G as 14G is in the constant use 4. 2 CPU (E5630 @2.53Ghz â 16 threads) 5. Hard Drive â 500G half of which is set as backup image  Purpose of the server for better understanding what I need:  1. I work with stock market 2. In real time server receiving about 500M of data from stock exchanges therefore speed is high factor 3. Much less data coming out of the server, yet high speed is required as well 4. Around 30 web sites 5. Streaming stock market charts 6. SQL is heavy loaded  Please, give me direction in which should go"
36763,Amazon EC2 V1,"First of all, you might want to have a look at the available EC2 instance types. Each instance type comes with a predefined amount of resources, such as CPU and memory. As disk volumes can be allocated as needed, you don't have to consider the storage requirements when choosing an instance type. The I/O performance is a very important factor though.  Considering your requirements, I believe you might be interested in High-Memory Double Extra Large, High-Memory Quadruple Extra Large, or possibly Cluster Compute Quadruple Extra Large. The latter definitely delivers the CPU and I/O performance you expect, while the two other options would need to be tested more carefully.  US West (Oregon) sounds like an excellent choice. It is ""near"" Vancouver, and the prices are lower compared to US West (Northern California). Cluster compute instances are available in US East (Virginia) at this time only though. For more information, see the EC2 pricing. You might find the  calculator useful as well.  That being said, my post is based entirely on replicating your current setup in the cloud, but there are a lof of ways to make it even better. When you have some time to spare, have a look at the AWS Architecture Center. There are some interesting reference architectures, whitepapers and recorded webinars available."

36759,Amazon EC2 V1,"Host failures do happen. Stopping a machine on a non-responsive host can sometimes take awhile even with force stop.  If you take into account the scale of ec2, a host failing somewhere is going to be a regular occurrence."
36759,Amazon EC2 V1,"I'm not sure it's fair to accept/assume that failures (should) occur as a result of the size of the infrastructure.  This is a product that Amazon provides and as such if there are failures occurring (especially with their more 'enterprise' offerings) I think it should be addressed with the utmost priority.  30 minutes of reboot or unusable system time for a cg1.4xl is just over a dollar.  In my instance I may be clustering dozens of machines costing me $50 or > per hour.  I'm not saying one machine will necessarily take down my entire cluster but it can cause problems with queuing and processing, causing me to manually intervene.  Manual intervention costs money and time and as such I'd prefer these machines maintain their uptime and functionality.  Regards"
36759,Amazon EC2 V1,"AWS is designed with the assumption that failures will occur. It is recommended that customers take this into account in how they design their infrastructure.

Elastic IP's doesn't seem to be the answer as they are not really attached to the system, instead they are just routed to it, thus gluster won't recognize the ip as it's own. not to mention the data transfer on a EIP with in the region would be expensive.   a dns solution would be possible however i don't see a way for amazon to update the dns based on dynamic IP. leaving it to manual intervention.   I was thinking VPC, however that seems to be a costly way to think about it.   so how are others handling the situation with their gluster installs?  also what about auto-scaling the gluster system?"
36757,Amazon EC2 V1,You can use the public DNS name which will resolve to the internal IP when resolved from within EC2. example: ec2-107-22-1-2.compute-1.amazonaws.com --> 10.1.2.3  We messed around with Gluster on EC2 and this approach worked well.
36757,Amazon EC2 V1,"Thank you, I have considered the public DNS of the ec2 instance. however I was under the assumption that that also changes when the instance goes offline and comes backup later. if it does makes me wish that there was a dns option that identifies the instance, regardless of ip. such as <instenceid>.2.compute-1.amazonaws.com, which like the alias dns system that works with the load balencer would change it's ip based on the instances ip regardless of the change.   however I need to test the public dns you describe and see if i am under a mistaken assumption."

36754,Amazon EC2 V1,"The good news is that your security group configuration appears to work as expected. As the instance is actively refusing the connection, you are in fact allowed to talk to it.

36752,Amazon EC2 V1,"Instance Status Check Failure for Windows Instance With 2 Network Interface Hi,  I have a strange problem where my Windows instance will fail to pass the instance status checks if I have 2 network interfaces attached.  If I start the instance with only 1 interface attached (the primary/default interface), everything is ok.  Everything is still OK if I then attach the 2nd interface hot (while the instance is already running).  While the instance is in this state (2 interfaces attached and running), everything is OK.  The problem is when the machine needs to restart.  If it restarts, I have to detach the 2nd network interfaces, start the instances, wait for windows to fully come up, and then attach the 2nd interface again.  If I don't do those steps, the instance status check will always fail.  As a workaround, I created some scripts using the EC2 API command line tools to attach and detach the 2nd interfaces before startup/shutdown.  Is this a known issue?  For background, I use 2 network interfaces in Windows on the same subnet in the same VPC.  The primary interface has an elastic IP attached to it.   The 2nd interface does not have an elastic IP attached to it.  I use this configuration so I can use Windows NAT (instead of doing the 2 subnet VPC in ""scenario 2"" of the wizard).  This keeps things relatively simple for me with a 1 subnet VPC and saves me the cost of having to run another instance just to do NAT."

36748,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi J. Talbot Jr.,  Tracert uses ICMP traffic and the Amazon EC2 network depriortizes this type of traffic.  It is recommended to use a TCP based traceroute.  Here a couple of tools that you can use to run a TCP based traceroute.  For Windows:  -TraceTCP http://tracetcp.sourceforge.net/  For Linux:  -TCP Traceroute http://michael.toren.net/code/tcptraceroute/ -traceroute -T hostname -p portnumber  Are you having any issues connecting to instance i-93e6bafd?  I took a look at the instance and it is reporting as healthy as well as its underlying host.  I was also able to get a response on TCP port 22 and 80.  Regards, Chen"

36747,Amazon EC2 V1,"The AWS staff can probably see what has happened and give you an explanation later on.  But until then I can guess a little:  Since you have used exactly 30 GB-Mo of EBS extra, but just have had one Windows instance running for one month, I guess you have one stopped Windows instance laying around somewhere in the world.  Another theory is that you have misunderstood something and have added 30 GB EBS extra to your instance, in excess of the 30 GB that you get automatically when running the instance.  Consuming extra I/O seems normal to me. That happens quickly for example with just a little bit of swapping and running Windows update."

I performed a telnet test on TCP port 80 and received a 'connection refused'.  You have your SSH port restricted to certain IPs.  Typically when there is a connection refused, there could be a firewall blocking it.   Is IP tables running on the instance?  At this point, you can stop the instance and detach the root EBS volume.  You can attach the EBS volume to as another device (ex. /dev/sdf) on another Linux instance and mount it as a filesystem.  If you made an recent changes, you can revert it here or check it the /var/log/messages to more information.  Once you are done, unmount it and detach the volume to attach it back to the original instance.  Regards, Chen  Edited by: ChenW@AWS on Mar 28, 2012 2:33 PM"

36744,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hello,  I think the next steps here will depend on the nature of the problem. As indicated previously, if you made a change that caused the problem then you can try and undo that.  Alternatively, if it was an ssh problem, for example, you can try and trouble shoot that issue.  Otherwise you could look at /var/log/messages to see if you can identify the issue. If you resolve the issue you can then re-attach this volume to the original instance and try and start that instance to see if this resolved the issue."

36741,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi,  When you stop and start an instance, its IP addresses change.  If there was an EIP attached to it, the EIP is released.

36741,Amazon EC2 V1,"I have started a new instance using an AMI created from the broken one.  New instance ID is i-78d59f1d  So, here's a detail about this instance that seems to be contributing to (or a symptom of) whatever problem is currently preventing me from connecting to the machine:  I run SSH on port 122 to reduce brute-force attacks.  I can ping the broken instance from other EC2 instances, but here is the message I get when I try to ssh to port 122:  ssh: connect to host 10.x.x.150 port 122: No route to host  If I try to ssh to the normal port 22, I get ""Connection refused"" as expected.  Port 122 is definitely open in the SG attached to the problematic instance.  Doesn't matter if I use private IP or EIP, I get the same result.  What am I doing wrong?"
36741,Amazon EC2 V1,"Well, things seem to have worked out.  I got it working for the most part, but had to mount detach the EBS volume, attach it to another temporary instance, change the sshd config to listen on port 22 again, and then attach the volume back to the original instance, start that instance, and now I can get into the system.  It still seems a bit odd, like terrible performance, but regardless I guess I have it from here.  Worst case scenario I'll stop the problem instance, start up a new one, attache the old EBS to it and just copy data over, creating a new server using the configs and data from the old messed up instance.  Thanks anyway."

After customising this so that it had my domain name in it, it looked something like this (only with my real domain name which will remain undisclosed):  $CFG->wwwroot = 'http://www.mydomain.com';   Of course the apache httpd.conf also needed updating to reflect the new location of the default index page, to bypass the Bitnami splash screen. All these changes were duly carried out, and the Moodle site worked perfectly.....until I rebooted the instance. Then for some reason, something tried to write to the config.php file in an attempt to restore the original $CFG->wwwroot, but ended up doing this:  'http://ec2-176-34-100-188.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com  As you can see it is missing an apostrophy and a semi-colon, and thus the entire config.php file was broken and the website cratered with a 500 error. Adding the apostrophy and the semi-colon fixed the issue, but only until the next reboot, when the same thing happens again! All I want it to do is to stay the way that I configured and saved it.

36733,Amazon EC2 V1,Need small 64-bit instance now.  I'm putting together a test server for a client.  It turns out it will be cheaper to buy a small workstation and install 2008 R2 instead of running a large instance for 2 months.
36733,Amazon EC2 V1,+1 big time.

36733,Amazon EC2 V1,"Is there any news on this? Can we get an update on a time line or a definitive answer that it won't be made available?  Even if it is a business decision - can't you just raise the price according to your business case but at least provide an option to run 64-bit on small instances. The price step from mikro to large is way to high.  Is it because you actually only want to run large instances and above? We still pay for traffic, load balancing and all the other services with small instances. Please enlighten us on the business case and timeline if you can?  regards,  Niels"

36726,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi rhendriksma,  This very issue frustrated me too when I started with AWS   There are two issues going on here. The first is that if your workstation belongs to an AD domain, it will by default think you want to use AD credentials. Your instance has no idea about your AD domain.  In the Remote Desktop Connection,  click the Options in the lower left corner. In the User name textbox, type: administrator  In the Computer textbox type the public DNS name or Elastic IP.  Then in the lower left corner, click the Open button.  You will then be promoted for a password.  The next trick is to use copy, then control-v  Copy and Paste for some reason does not work.  Kind Regards, Lance"
36726,Amazon EC2 V1,"Thanks for the info Lance, but I have already done everything you suggested.  This is a home computer that doesn't know about AD.  So what is my next step?"

36726,Amazon EC2 V1,"I started having the problems described above after switching over to an Elastic IP and Route 53 DNS name.

I have gone through docs and help files but have not found any place that allowed me to set the EC2config parameters prior to launching the instance.  Thanks in advance.
36725,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hello Kevin,  Did you enable SetPassword after sysprep before you created the new AMI? If not, a new password will not be generated and instead the Administrator password will be the same as it was for the instance you used to create the AMI.  If you would like the Administrator password to be regenerated every time you launch an instance from your custom AMI, open the EC2ConfigService Settings utility and select the option marked ""Enable SetPassword feature after sysprep"" before bundling your instance into a custom AMI. Selecting that setting will cause instances launched from the AMI you create to have randomly generated passwords that you can retrieve through the AWS Management Console or with ec2-get-password from the command line.  I hope that helps.  Regards, Mary"
36725,Amazon EC2 V1,"Mary   Thanks for the response. As far as I can tell, all or any of the things you are suggesting need to be done from within the running instance. The issue is that without a password, I cannot access the running instance. EC2config seems like a handy toolset, but with out access to a RDP to the instance, it is of limited use. When I created my AMI copy, I did not have any opportunity to select SetPassword. I also have no option for Bundling the instance the selections are not active.  At this point it seems that this public instance is not so public after all. I will probably delete it and go about doing something else."

I have assigned an elastic IP to my instance. Lets say its 11.22.333.44. The Public DNS is ec2-11.22.333.44.compute-1.amazonaws.com  When I connect to the elastic IP directly, the site loads super fast. However, when I go to the Public DNS its terribly slow and the images don't load. The reason this is important is because I have a site example.com which I have added to Route 53. I also went to Namecheap to add the DNS configuration that Amazon Route 53 provides.  When I access example.com directly, it provides the same slow results as accessing the Public DNS. Essentially, I am trying to have my example.com load just as fast as the elastic IP.   I would really appreciate any help you can provide. Thanks!  Edited by: Dante Serendi on Apr 1, 2012 6:18 AM"

I also have a small service grant from AWS in Education (http://aws.amazon.com/education/).  I'm writing because after I asked my students to sign up to AWS and launch an EC2 t1.micro (free tier) instance, one student wrote to me that:   ""I've been receiving phone calls from Amazon about the web services. They wanted to make sure I know everything about the service. They said the cost could run into the thousands. Has anyone else received calls from them and is this normal?""  My question: What triggers this phone call?  I cannot reproduce it.  No one else has reported this phone call.    Thanks in advance for any help.  Hoping someone has seen this before, Christian  P.S.

That said, I would be interested in hearing more about this call that your student brought to your attention. For security reasons, we never discuss details of specific accounts in the public forums. I would recommend that you ask your student to contact AWS Customer Service directly so that we can get their account details and look into the matter.  I hope this is more helpful.  Kit B."

36711,Amazon EC2 V1,Some versions of linux (Redhat especially) have iptables installed by default with a very restrictive ruleset. You may want to try to disable it or add rules to allow the ports for your application.
36711,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hello Juan,  I have checked the instance and the underlying host is degraded. Please stop and then start the instance to relocate it to a different host. After starting the instance, you will need to reassociate the EIP.  Let us know if that resolves the issue.  Regards, Mary"
36711,Amazon EC2 V1,"Mary,  I tried to stop it and after two hours it never stopped. I then tried to force stop it and after a while it did start. However, I was never able to start it again. I got frustrated and just created a new instance and started again from scratch. And then everything worked."

36709,Amazon EC2 V1,"John Lawson,  The problem here would not be related to the underlying host, it looks like this is a custom AMI that is likely experiencing issues with a process on boot. The CPU is currently hovering around 90% and causing the instance to become unresponsive.  I would highly recommend launching from a usable AMI of your or one of the stock AMI's. You may also find a benefit in re-attaching your root volume as a secondary device to a working instance to correct any issues with a startup process."

36707,Amazon EC2 V1,"You are correct. Each EC2 instance gets an IP address in the 10.0.0.0/8 range. The private IP address is dynamic and will change if you stop the instance. You will keep it as long as the instance is running, and it will remain the same across reboots as well. As you have noted, the name server is located in 172.16.0.0/24. If you need more control over the local network topology, you might be interested in VPC."

36706,Amazon EC2 V1,1. Not particularly. Its all going to depend what you mean by heavy. RDS might be an option here.  2. Every instance outside of vpc is assigned a public ip. There is a defualt limit of 5 per region to request an elastic ip. But you can have that limit increased.  3. That is a spot request. Instances started as spot instances can be terminated at any time.

36702,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi,   You will not loose any data when you reboot your ephemeral instance.  However, you cannot stop and start Ephemeral store backed instance to move it to another host as the Ephemeral store is fixed on a particular host.  Because of that you will not be able to stop and start the instance if your instance current host is degraded.  That will result in a limited disaster recovery plan.  You will have to back up your important data the to an EBS volume and use the EBS volume for your recovery.  Also, if your instance underlying host is degraded, your only option is to launch a replacement.  That being said, Ephemeral store backed instance should work fine, you just have to plan for disaster recovery in a different way.  Now regarding connection to the instance, the reason you are not able to access it is that your security group did not allow access to your instance.  Currently the security group only allow access from the instance itself or any instance that use the same security group.  To allow access to your instance, please go to AWS Management Console - EC2 - Security Groups.  Click on the ""Default"" security group and on the bottom pane click on ""Inbound"" tab to add your new rule.  Your rule should be TCP, port range 0-65535 or just 3389 and for security purposes, the source should be your external IP address.  You can check your external IP address by going to http://checkip.amazonaws.com/  Once you have the rule above in place, you should be able to RDP to your instance.  Regards,   -Daniel"

36694,Amazon EC2 V1,"Persistent IP address/Public DNS Hello,  I have several servers that we are using to host some web services as a front end to an amazon RDS database.  We just noticed that if the servers reboot, or shut down, then they get a new Public DNS. I can understand that the IP address may change, but I am suprised the DNS changes. Does that mean that every time the machine reboots, I have to change my public dns records.  i.e. I current map  xyz.denovosoftware.com to ec2-67-202-54-149.compute-1.amazonaws.com  but if I reboot, I have to remap that. It takes 24 hours to propagate so people will be offline for a while.  Even elastic IP addresses use a the public DNS, so I have to remember to change the elastic IP target every time I reboot. Very error prone.  What is the reccomended solution for this? I figured I would be able to associate an IP address or DNS with an instance ID, but I cannot seem to do this."
36694,Amazon EC2 V1,"The DNS maps 1:1 to an IP address. Which is why the public DNS changes.  Now, elastic IP is the route to use. It will only get disassociated if you stop the instance. You can use the API/CLI tools to assign an IP address on boot."
36694,Amazon EC2 V1,"That is the problem, when stopping and restarting the instance things get dissociated.  Is there an example how to use the API to assign an IP address on boot?"
36694,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi denovosoftware,  D. Johansson is correct, but I think you didn't understand him.  You need to create an Elastic IP address, this is a static IP address that you reserve for use. This will not change as it is allocated to you. You can then set your DNS A-Record to this IP Address.  Now all you need to do is assign the Elastic IP address to your instance and your instance now has a static IP address. If your server crashes and you start a new server you can allocate the Elastic IP address to the new server, etc.  An Elastic IP address is also free, so long as it is assigned to a running instance. You are only charged if you have reserved the IP address, but are not using it.  Many Thanks, Ady"
36694,Amazon EC2 V1,"Ok. For other people, just to clarify a bit.  The elastic IP is associated with an particular Instance ID, not with a public DNS, although it may look that way in the AWS management tool. If the instance reboots, it will get a new IP and a new public DNS. However, the elastic IP will also update itself to be pointing to the new public DNS of that instance, instead of the old one.  At least that is what I understand."

Secondly, I will be travelling a lot and need a VPS to not have to worry about some PC in some room on the other side of the world.  I have been toying with a m1.small	windows instance, hosting SAM broadcaster streaming to a local instance of Icecast server (my hosting service relays the signal from that).  This post is really to confirm a few questions about my virtual hardware.  But first some loose min requirements...  512MB Ram Processor to suit SAM broadcaster Bandwidth to suit content uploads and 200kbs in and out Storage for 30gb music as a starting point Cost is a big factor (I'm looking in to Linux, but that's later).   I have a POC up and running after some fun with firewalls, dyndns and security groups.  My noob questions...  Will a reserved instance suit my needs better (it will be running 24/7)? Should I store data (music) on an S3 drive... or locally on my instance? Will the small instance suit my needs? Seems to be OK for now Will I get stable uninterrupted 200kbs bandwidth? (min 128kbs & 64kbs audio streams) in and out. This is critical. I'm paranoid of losing my instance, so what's the best way for it to not disappear? I hear some terminate when not in use. Should I capture AMI's periodically?   My requirements will grow from simple auto DJ streaming client to proper serving over time.  Eventually I'd like to host my web page and full listener-facing icecast server (50-100 128kbs concurrent client connections) on the same instance, so if there's anything I should know now about growth I'd like to hear it:)  Thanks in advance for the advice.

I don't see how it could be because the root volume reads as 8G on the EBS snapshot.  Sorry for the noob questions... learning quickly!  ++++   OK, I just discovered that the instance type m1.small is what is creating the /mnt sdb partition.  So correct me if I'm wrong, it looks like EBS volumes are only volumes that are root partitions sda1.  In other words, I can't use EBS snapshots for backing up sdb /mnt data.  Right?  ++++  I'm getting up to speed now.  Come to find out the AMI I'm using which is the default Ubuntu 64bit 10.04 LTS in the wizard is in fact EBS backed for the root partition sba1 which in instance type m1.small is only 8Gig.  The mount ""storage"" sdb /mnt is 150Gig in not EBS backed.  I'm want to leverage the use of EBS for backup / snapshots and don't want to use the available /mnt sdb to symbolically link /var/log /var/www etc... to.  My understanding is that if there are ever issues with the instance, the /mnt sdb partition would be the first to get lost forever.  So this is what I have in mind.  Create a separate EBS volume, attach and mount it via my instance and point /var/log, /var/www (my data) to it.  It seems such a waste of space though leaving the sdb /mnt partition unused ""150G""....  Or would it be best to ln -s my data to /mnt and rsync/rsnapshot my data from /mnt to a newly attached EBS volume and then make snapshots of this new EBS volume for backups?  It would seem a bit redundant to do this it would seem and require addition IO and cost too.  Any direction at all would be greatly appreciated.  Loving EC2!! learning as fast as I can!

36673,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hello efj33ndek,  The Local Storage that you see for instances in the table in the following link is also known as instance-storage or ephemeral storage, and it should be noted that this does not persist across stop/starts of an EBS-backed instance and should be considered as temporary storage. See: EC2 Instance Types   Usually with EBS-backed instances this storage is not available unless you explicitly set the block device mapping when you first run a new instance. This can be done using the block-device mapping options with the EC2 command line tools. Additionally, if you create a custom AMI of the instance after setting these block device mappings then these mappings will propogate to the children instances of that AMI (you have to be careful at that point when starting instances of different sizes from the AMI as the ephemeral storage available might not match up, e.g. t1.micros don't have any ephemeral storage).  The command line tools documentation has some examples of how to set block device mapping when running a new instance. See: API Command Line Reference   Additionally, there is some more detailed information available regarding block device mapping in the EC2 documentation:  ED2 Blod Defice Mapping Concepts   Regards, Mary"

For security reason, you should not use www-data or apache user to log via sftp, you need to grant access to /var/www for your system user.  One solution is to add your user in apache group, and verify that the group can write in /var/www. If not, you'll have to use chmod command (g+w).  Having 777 is not a best practice... If you have a compromise system user, it will have access to all your website."
36667,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi  Thanks for the response. Getting closer, but some things are still unclear to me.  Right now there is just one user - EC2-user. I don't know what that it is, whether it's a system user or an appache user or what.   When I log on via SSH, I come into a folder also called EC2-user.  /Home/Ec2-user  My website will be here:  /var/www/html  When I look at the directories on SFTP, all those found in the root have the owner ""root root"".  EC2-user can't create or do anything in that /var/www/html so what do I need to do firstly, to get full access to that folder through SFTP? It's currnt owner is also listde as ""root root"".  So far this permissions issue has been the biggest challenge to me as a newcomer to working with linux directly through AWS.  Edited by: aspero210 on Mar 30, 2012 8:04 AM"
36667,Amazon EC2 V1,"If you really want to deliver your website by sftp, I think the best thing is to create a specific user, apacheupload for instance, with ""apache"" as a primary group.  Then you change owner et group of /var/www/html to apache:apache, and chmod 775.  Then you upload your files in /var/www/html by sftp (this folder can be the $HOME of the new user).  I tried, it works, not sure that upload directly content by sftp is the best way to deliver a new release."
36667,Amazon EC2 V1,"The best way to deliver the website in this case is by CVS for sure, and this I have done.  But what I want to do is update or customise parts of the website, and I can't think of a more user-friendly way than of using sftp. For example, if I want to change a logo or a background colour, and I can just upoad the appropriate file.  If there is a better way I'll use it."

You can view this information in your console output by right clicking your instance and selecting ""Get System Log"" or with the API command 'ec2-get-console-output'.  mount.nfs: No such device mountall: mount /var/apachelogs 579 terminated with status 32 The disk drive for /var/apachelogs is not ready yet or not present Continue to wait; or Press S to skip mounting or M for manual recovery  I would recommend re-attaching one of the root volumes as a secondary volume to a new stock AMI you have access to and correct your fstab entries and/or NFS configuration."

36663,Amazon EC2 V1,"need help troubleshooting custom ami - appears to boot cleanly but no ssh Hi all, I'm attempting to take a Red Hat 5.6 (2.6.18) build and make an AMI out of it. I've done the following:  1. built it on vmware from standard iso 2. grabbed the kernel modules and installed them:   cd / wget http://ec2-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-modules-2.6.18-xenU-ec2-v1.0-x86_64.tgz  tar xzvf ec2-modules-2.6.18-xenU-ec2-v1.0-x86_64.tgz   3. changed ifcfg-eth0 to  DEVICE=eth0 BOOTPROTO=dhcp ONBOOT=yes TYPE=Ethernet USERCTL=yes PEERDNS=yes IPV6INIT=no  4. found an aki of aki-9800e5f1 for 2.6.18  5. adjusted grub to use ""root (hd0)""  6. bundled with  ec2-bundle-vol -c mycert.pem -k mykey.pem --user 1234 -d /mnt -e /root/.ec2 --no-inherit -r x86_64 --kernel=aki-9800e5f1 --generate-fstab -p rhel56-soe  7. uploaded and launched.  it took a few iterations but eventually i could see what looks like a successful boot log. but alas, i can't ssh to it.  i'm assuming this is a problem on the host but without a console to sit down at i'm wondering is there any other way to troubleshoot? is there an aws version of HP's iLo? i know iptables isn't running as i can get to the instance before bundling.

36660,Amazon EC2 V1,Load balancer isn't allowing large file attachment uploads We are facing an issue with uploading a large file (5.82MB) with the load balancer. The file is being uploaded successfully when we are uploading with a single instance and 1 individual browsing the website with IP address.  But we need to be able to upload the file in the load balancer mode also.  Setup Information: 2 App Instance: Website is located in these 2 instance with the load balancer configured. 1 File Server Instance : File service located on this server.  We are uploading the file on the file server through our website located on the aforementioned 2 instances in load balancer. We are using WCF service which is being called in the website to upload the file.  We have tried all the settings in our instances to make it work with the load balancer but it still doesn't work.  We found these 2 urls which says it may have something to do with the load balancer:  URLs: https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=331899&tstart=0 https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=78895  Is there a config change that can be made with our load balancer to ensure large files aren't timed out.  We are looking for your quick response to fix this issue.
36660,Amazon EC2 V1,"We've had difficulties with ELB and long durations.  The only workaround we have found is to use the instance's public IP address for long duration connections, for download we issue an HTTP redirect to the IP.  In your case I would change the post back location in the HTML form to use the public IP. Then once the upload completes redirect the browser back to your load balanced domain. That's assuming you are not using SSL of course (that might complicate things a bit)"
36660,Amazon EC2 V1,We are using SSL so this solution won't necessarily work.  We saw in one of the other posts that I linked where AWS support made a configuration change in the environment to allow the ELB to allow long uploads.  Can we have a similar change made to our environment?  This is critical for how our application runs because users have the ability to upload pdf documents as large as 10MB.

36658,Amazon EC2 V1,"I see that this instance has a very restrictive set of security rules which limit access to certain IP addresses only. As such I am not able to validate for you whether I can connect to it.  What I can say is that there is nothing on the console that indicates a problem, and the underlying platform appears to be running correctly. I can also see that the CPU usage on your instance appears to have dropped to nil in the last half hour, which suggests rather strongly that the operating system within may have crashed.  I would suggest that your next step is to issue a Stop followed by a Start."
36658,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi have stopped the instance right after seeing your reply, but it was saying ""stopping"" for a long time (about 1 hour) then I did a force stop. It is yet to stop.  Please help.  Thanks."

36658,Amazon EC2 V1,"Yes, it did finally come to a stop and then I started the machine.   Is there anything you can tell me on what would have gone wrong. I will go through the system logs to see if anything comes up but if you can tell from you side, it will help. Thanks once again for your help."

36657,Amazon EC2 V1,This appears to be due to you exceeding your volume limit in the US-EAST region. I have increased this limit for you.
36657,Amazon EC2 V1,"Thanks, is it possible to see any error message anywhere? In the request no error message showed up.  BR  Ulf"
36657,Amazon EC2 V1,I believe this error message is currently only visible via our internal tools.
36656,Amazon EC2 V1,Communication problem between EBS instances It looks like there is some communication problem between our EBS instances  This are the instances that are having the issue i-851a6fe9 i-ead04085 i-82606ded i-a5f29ecb  those 4 send requests to i-7e97ce11  Thanks
36656,Amazon EC2 V1,"I need more information to investigate this.  Can you advise what type of traffic you are trying to transfer, using which IP addresses and which port numbers?  Can you provide a traceroute between two affected instances?"

36655,Amazon EC2 V1,These changes do take effect immediately and there is no requirement to restart the instance. If you can quote the instance ID I can take a look at it for you?
36654,Amazon EC2 V1,Downloading EC2 data I want to download my private data on EC2 to my windows7 pc. I donno how to download the snapshot or volume. Can someone help me to download
36654,Amazon EC2 V1,Snapshots and volumes cannot be downloaded. You can only mount the volume and download its contents from an instance.
36654,Amazon EC2 V1,Thanks for the heads-up. But now i'm stuck with this. Can you tell me how to download instance?
36653,Amazon EC2 V1,"Connect two different ec2 instances across regions Hi  I have two EC2 instances,one running in US east region and another instance running in Asia Pacific region.Now my requirement is I want to set up mysql on both the EC2 instances on both the regions and then do some  replication of the mysql database using tungsten replicator.For this to work the two EC2 instances on both the regions should ping each other.  How can I ping one ec2 instance when I login into another EC2 instance which are in different regions.  Thanks in Advance"
36653,Amazon EC2 V1,You would need to set up security groups as you would with any other remote connection (By IP address). Regions within aws are completely isolated from each other.
36653,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi Johansson  Thanks a lot for your reply. As you have mentioned that we have to configure the Security Groups with the IP's,does that mean we have to provide the public IP's of the EC2 instance on the security groups."
36652,Amazon EC2 V1,"Instance Status Check failing randomly for EC2 instance Hi, I have an Network Address Translator EC2 instance (i-c4d1818d) that has basically been created from ami-vpc-nat-1.0.0-beta.i386-ebs (ami-095b6c7d) without changes in it's configuration.  I shut it down remotly every night and start it again in the morning using the Java SDK. The trouble is that on some days it comes up properly, but every few days (e.g. this morning) it comes up and then fails the Instance Status Check. Which effectively makes some other instances unusable that rely on the NAT.  I know that shutting it down and starting it again manually brings it up in a proper state. However, as it is part of a system that delivers a service to our customers and that should always be reachable, I would rather not have to manually correct the instances status every other day in order to make it work.  (I just realised that this morning the instance came up and seemed to be reachable for about twenty minutes and then all of a sudden was not reachable any more, failing the status check.)  Please help, thanks in advance.  Best regards, Michael  Edited by: michipf on Mar 30, 2012 1:11 AM"
36651,Amazon EC2 V1,"Error in user data script - but works fine when SSHing into same instance I am trying to download my Rails web app from git as part of the user data script. AMI in question is based on Amazon Linux AMI, but my script has previously installed what is needed for this app (like newer Ruby and RVM).  My script goes like this:  	#!/bin/bash -e         cd /var/app 	git init 	git remote add origin git@github.com:zmilojko/myapp.git 	git pull origin master Â  	echo ""  preparing application (bundle, rake tasks)"" 	chmod 777 /var/app -R 	sh /var/app/STARTME   The STARTME script is exactly the following:  #!/bin/bash -ex cd /var/app  bundle install rake db:create RAILS_ENV=""production"" rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=""production"" rake db:fixtures:load RAILS_ENV=""production"" rake assets:precompile RAILS_ENV=""production""   And it fails. I have played around with different shells (bash and sh), and environment variables - but it didn't help. If you are not familiar with Ruby/Rails, bundle and rake are essentially Ruby scripts, but the problem is not in them themselves - my main suspicion now is on the RVM not being completelly setup, but I cannot debug further because of this: exactly same script runs perfectly OK when I SSH to the ec2 instance immediately after it is available!  So, my questions I cannot figure out from documentation:  So what is the difference when executing User Data script as part of boot and executing same script via SSH, as root?  Is there any code that executes after the User Data? Isn't User Data executing in the end, after the AMI's own init scripts?  I would appreciate any help or ideas how to continue, I am loosing my head over this for a second day, and this should be rather trivial task... Thanks.

36650,Amazon EC2 V1,You're using Integrated Security and you need to make your database aware of the fact that you want to IIS Apppool user to be able to connect to it. Here's more info: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3262030/why-does-this-code-cause-an-error  You might also want to consider using AppHarbor where all this stuff is handled for you (and you'll still be running on top of AWS).

36649,Amazon EC2 V1,I am showing this instance as not even beginning the boot process. The most likely explanation is that you have a defective AMI; is this one that you have built yourself?
36649,Amazon EC2 V1,"Yes, this AMI is built by myself, but that instance have been terminated."
36649,Amazon EC2 V1,If the AMI is not booting then there is not much we can do in this scenario.  The one thing I would say is that as this is an EBS-backed instance you can detach the volume and attach it to a new (working) instance to recover data if needed.

Beware people, after you purchase reserved instances, when aws does updates and a problem comes up with their update, you will have to pay to get them to fix it, even when it is their fault.   I made them aware of cross contamination between different accounts. In other words logout of one account and log into a different account, and settings from both accounts show up in one account. One account was mine, the other a customers. The cross contamination consisted of sensitive data, clearly evidencing a serious security flaw.   After exhausting every free method of contact, with not one reply. I finally payed the support fee, they thanked me for bringing the security flaw to their attention, and implemented a fix. I was charged $164 for support fee's. Even though it was a security flaw in their web interface, the aws management console.  If you intend on having something live, that needs to be up, you will have to pay the support fee's on top of the normal fee's, or you will experience down time. Even when it is their fault, they WILL NOT fix it without payment.  This post is a perfect example, as aws staff has replied to numerous other post's but ignores this one. They know their is a problem with the update, but refuse to provide the fix without a fee.   Amazon Web Services on numerous occasions has evidenced their lack of ethics, morals, and clearly criminal intent, by baiting with low fee's, then forcing additional fee's by refusing to reply to all the free methods of contact concerning problems with their system.

36641,Amazon EC2 V1,"Thank you for the reply. Now that was not so hard was it. We all understand that things happen, even more so as things get more complicated. It is not that problems crop up, but how they are handled.   My past experiences have been less than satisfactory. I hope this is an indicator that us lowly customers, who do not pay thousands or hundreds of dollars a month in fee's, will be better serviced. Just because some of use are not purchasing thousands of dollars in services today, does not mean we will not in the future.   One of the greatest things about AWS and competitors of AWS, is that monthly costs for small independent developers, has diminished substantially in the past few years. Allowing people to develop on a scale only possible to large organizations in the past.    To ignore the small guys, is a crime in itself, as there will be many small operators that will eventually become some of your largest volume customers. To cause them to move on to a competitor (as I have) at this stage in the game, for no other reason than, reporting basic support for AWS issues, is a very closed minded business plan.   One would think that AWS, would want to do everything they can to stimulate the development process. AWS has gone far, has a lot of great features. the only problem I have had, is in reporting problems with the AWS system it self. I hope that issue will some day go by the wayside."

36637,Amazon EC2 V1,"New to Amazon EC2 want to run an application Hi there.  I am doing a project at college based on cloud computing. It is a new area for me and I do not have any previous experience. I have signed up to Amazon services and all are available to me. I want to know whether it is possible to run a particular game using cloud service? By this, I mean run an PC game inside  a preconfigured operating system.   At the moment I am thinking that if I focus my project toward cloud storage that is something I can discuss in detail and especially the benefits of it.  I am sorry if this is a really dull questions but I am so fascinated with this and that is why I chose it as a project. It is like being a kid and wanting to ask all the questions but you are not sure where to start. Unfortunately there isn't a course that covers cloud computing and how you configure services etc...   For example, one thing I am curious about, I have Amazon s3, I believe that is the cloud storage. How do I link that to an existing windows server environment?   Thanks in advance"
36637,Amazon EC2 V1,EC2 is a virtual machine and is able to run most software. The exception being anything that requires hardware access like 3d accelerated games.  S3 is a storage service. Access is done via API. You can download clients like cloudberry for windows to access s3 in an ftp like interface.
36637,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi. Thanks for your reply.  I have been looking at some of the documents for configuring EC2 but it is all console based. Is there a way to configure and access the OS in a GUI environment?   Last questions, how would I implement cloud storage in windows server 2003 / 2008 environment?  I have tried this with cloud drive, where you are given a folder and in there you can put all your shares, scripts and applications. So, everything the user saves, it is automatically backed up. Any links to documents that cover this would be really appreciated.  Thanks."
36637,Amazon EC2 V1,"EC2 has a control console which allow you to launch and control instances. This can be accessed in the web console and API.  Windows instances have remote desktop. Linux instances generally do not come with a gui installed, but some people have had success getting one installed. Most linux administration is done via console anyway.  S3 is a storage service, all it does it store and replicate files. When you say that you want it integrated into windows what do you mean?  Cloudberry gives you FTP like access to an s3 bucket. There are other applications that use s3 for automated backup. How do you want it integrated?"
36637,Amazon EC2 V1,"Let's consider this simple example. We have a small business and the user data is stored in a NAS device. As the administrator, you have configured the appropriate access rights and configured the required security groups. All of the data is stored here and backed up to another external device. The difficulty I am having is understanding how Amazon S3 will come into the aid. Are we going to transfer our backups via ftp? if so, how secure is it? Is there a way to automate this?   also, is there a way to access and save data to the bucked without using internal storage? So, we are migrating all out storage to Amazon S3.  I guess, I need to read every single userguide for this to fully understand it. At the moment it is looking quite bleak."
36637,Amazon EC2 V1,"Its not actually FTP. The protocol is a web service that goes over SSL. Cloudberry provides and ftp like interface to s3.   Yes you can automate it, either using existing software, if it meets your needs, or writing your own to take advantage of the API.  Access control can be done using bucket policies and/or IAM.  s3 is not a block device, although there are layers that can kind of emulate it for certain cases. Its best when files are committed to s3 in its entirety."
36637,Amazon EC2 V1,Hi again.  Thank you very much for your help. It has been really helpful and has cleared some issues I was having.

36632,Amazon EC2 V1,"What is ""backed by EBS""? Hello,  I can't find out what does it really mean when an image is said to be backed by EBS.  Does it mean that I have to use EBS for storage? Will it cost me more???  Why is it that all the AMIs I found (latest Linux distributions) are all ""backed by EBS...""?  Thanks."
36632,Amazon EC2 V1,"Yes it means that the root volume is an ebs volume. While you do have to pay for the space, you do gain more flexibility. You can fail away from a bad host as well as stop your instance when you don't need it running."
36632,Amazon EC2 V1,Thanks for your reply.  What is the reason that all AMIs are backed by EBS? What are the other options and are they cheaper?
36632,Amazon EC2 V1,"Not all of them are, but i think the gui in the web console defaults to ebs backed. Its more newbie proof than instance storage. All you need to do is look through threads on this forum of people losing data without realizing they were on instance storage.  I would personally recommend staying with ebs backed volumes unless you know exactly what you are doing."
36632,Amazon EC2 V1,"Well, if I need to pay extra just to get a reliable data storage, I may need to rethink the value of using AWS for this purpose.  I still can't find a straight answer / explanation as to the question if using an EBS storage will cost me extra and what is the difference with image store.  It seems to me that AWS wrote the help files to people that already know...  Thanks again."
36632,Amazon EC2 V1,"EC2 is an system where your instance is a virtual machine that runs on a physical host. Unlike some hosting providers, your machine only keeps affinity to the host as long as its running.  EBS storage = SAN volume stored outside of the host machine.  Instance storage = Local disks on the host.  Both storage methods are reliable, EBS is much more flexible than instance storage.  With EBS you get the following: 1. Ability to snapshot your volumes. 2. Ability to put your instance into a stopped state. (Which also means you can fail away from a failed host) 3. Ability to detach and move volumes to different instances. 4. Can also quickly create images  Instance storage has a couple of advantages, but more for specific use cases: 1. Generally more predictable IO performance. 2. Included in the cost of the instance (Although storage amount depends on instance size).  EBS volumes are priced by GB/Month, plus a charge for I/O operations."
36632,Amazon EC2 V1,"Where can I find pricing information on the ""backed by EBS"" that is part of the Linux AMI package? This was a cost I was not aware of when setting up."
36632,Amazon EC2 V1,"Thank you.  So what do you do if you bought an instance with Instance Storage but all AMIs are EBS ?  Also, can you use both EBS and local storage?  Can you transition between the two, from EBS to Instance Storage and the opposite direction?  Thanks for your help."
36632,Amazon EC2 V1,"ALL amis have a root type which is either ebs or instance store. Not all amis are available as both.  You can use both types of storage, but some of the features depend on whether the root volume is ebs or instance storage.  To enable instance storage on an ebs backed ami, you need to use the command line tools to launch the instance and and block device mapping. Keep in mind that if you stop the instance in this case, any data stored on instance store volumes will be lost.  Instance backed amis can have ebs volumes attached to them as well."
36632,Amazon EC2 V1,This is the pricing for us-east. The ec2 page has all the pricing for all regions. (Its quite a ways down on the page)  Amazon EBS Volumes $0.10 per GB-month of provisioned storage $0.10 per 1 million I/O requests  Amazon EBS Snapshots to Amazon S3 $0.125 per GB-month of data stored
36631,Amazon EC2 V1,DNS failing and can't stop an instance i-45b3832b Repeat problem from yesterday where ec2 node was having DNS troubles.  I was instructed to stop and start the machine from this forum but then stopping couldn't work and I was told it was a hardware error.  Having the problem again today and suspecting I never got off of the troubled host.   i-45b3832b  Help!
36631,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi,  Have you tried a force stop? I'm engaging the Ec2 team to take a look.  Regards, Preethi"
36631,Amazon EC2 V1,Hi Preethi; yeah we have.  It seems like that hardware host is unhappy.  Can you tell if I actually was able to migrate hardware hosts yesterday?  Or did I just get rebooted onto the same disfunctional node?
36631,Amazon EC2 V1,"We have been trying force stop for last 30 minutes and the machine is  hanging on ""stopping"" without rebooting."
36631,Amazon EC2 V1,"wutb,  We have resolved the issue with your instance, it now appears to be in the running state and responding without issue."
36631,Amazon EC2 V1,"Did we end up migrating hosts are we still on the same hardware?  In addition, for the second day the DNS on the machine failed.  Is there something fundementally wrong with the machine with respect to DNS/networking?"
36630,Amazon EC2 V1,"Is anyone reviewing ec2-abuse@amazon.com Hi,  I've sent abuse email to subject address regarding domain chromewhois.com hosted on EC2  which is currently publishing false information and thus bringing reputational risks to my name and still haven't received any answer from abuse team.  Today I found two other domains of the same owners that have the same incorrect information posted on the sites: whoismind.com firewhois.com  No whois details of these domains' owner are valid and thus I have to abuse them through the hosting provider company which is EC2 in this case.  Please let me know how and when this will be treated.  With best regards, George"
36630,Amazon EC2 V1,"I tried the chromewhois.com using our various domains and all the information was correct.  Is this the only ""whois"" that is reporting your information incorrectly?  James"
36630,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi, George,  I'm sorry for the delay in getting back to you. In researching these three domains, I've confirmed that the sites are hosted at the following IP addresses:  chromewhois.com 173.245.60.144 199.27.134.55  whoismind.com 173.245.61.15 199.27.134.80  firewhois.com 199.27.135.61 173.245.61.156  Searching ARIN shows these IP addresses are all assigned to Cloudflare, Inc. I recommend contacting their abuse team directly at abuse@cloudflare.com for assistance.  I hope this helps.  Best regards, Matthew P."
36629,Amazon EC2 V1,"No service is started from a custom built AMI Hi,  I'm looking for some pointers here in case anyone else had a similar situation. I've built a AMI using a plain basic CentOS 6.2 installation. The kernel seems to be booting up fine in EC2, but it appears that no services has started. I've checked the the image's chkconfig --list and everything appears to be fine - all runlevel 4 stuff is good. /etc/inittab has 3 in it but I read that EC2 ignores it and uses 4 instead. I'm unable to do anything with the instance now despite multiple rounds of changing the image with different troubleshooting mechanism but none is showing up.

The whole point of the new instance is that I found my first EC2 machine was too small.  It's a micro, and I understand you can't just 'add' RAM, that you have to start over.  If that's incorrect, please let me know as that would be the ideal solution.  I don't really need to change anything other than my RAM capacity."

36607,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi Zammis,  Due to the failure of the underlying physical host your instance was located on, you'll likely need to issue two force stop commands in order to have your instance transition to the stopped state.  If you have the EC2 command line API tools installed on your local computer, then this is an example of the command you should issue twice:  ec2-stop-instances i-45599821 --force   You can also force stop an instance through the AWS Management Console, if you would prefer to do it that way.  Best Regards, -Cindy"

36606,Amazon EC2 V1,"Creating AMI from Instance-Backed Ubuntu Image - Machine Never Comes Online Hey all,  I used ubuntu/images/ubuntu-natty-11.04-amd64-server-20120312 (ami-4c16ca25) and started up a new m1.large instance. I logged in and set a bunch of stuff up (nginx, PHP, etc - nothing related to the boot). The machine is still running and accessible.  I attempted to bundle the machine as per the instructions at <http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/creating-snapshot-s3-linux.html>. I initially had a problem where an instance created from the image would go straight from pending to 'terminated', but solved that with the patch from <https://forums.aws.amazon.com/message.jspa?messageID=189310>.  Now I've got my image created and registered, but when I try and create an instance from it (tried m1.small and m1.large), it never comes online. It's reported as 'running', but it's not responding to ping nor TCP connections on port 22 or 80. I've tried rebundling and restarting several times.  It's in the same security group as the original server (so the security group is fine), and is unreachable both from the original server and from outside of AWS. The new server loads the same kernel as the original, and no ramdisk (same as the original).  I cannot see anything that looks obviously wrong to me in the system log, but I'm fairly unfamiliar with running linux in a virtualization environment and really have no idea what I'm looking at. I've attached the log.  I'd really like to figure this out, I stupidly poured a lot of work into this image before testing the creation of the image and am now a reboot away from losing it all. :/  EDIT: I just remembered looking through more docs for answers that I ran a dist-upgrade right after booting the instance... Did I bugger up the kernel or something? Is there any way to repackage and recover? Some way to set up 'pvgrub' or something to allow it to boot with whatever's installed?  Thanks for any suggestions anyone can provide.  Edited by: cv-adam on Mar 28, 2012 8:34 PM"

36604,Amazon EC2 V1,"cc1 and cc2 instances in same placement group Hi,  Our application requires having one or two long running cc1 instances and many cc2 instances for a short period when there is a high workload. The cc1 instances share data with the itinerant cc2 instances via GlusterFS. Currently distributing the data is our main bottleneck.

36604,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi Chris,  No, it is not currently possible to have cc1 and cc2 instances in the same placement group.  Each instance type would need to be in its own placement group.

36601,Amazon EC2 V1,"ELB Dropping Connections Hi,  Is there a timeout on connections made to servers via a load balancer?  We have some connections that might remain active for 1-2 hours, slowly pushing data from the server to the client. When testing behavior on an individual instance this appears to work correctly. However when doing the same task via an ELB we get lots of dropped connections after between 30 and 40 minutes.  Many Thanks, Ady"
36601,Amazon EC2 V1,The connections do timeout if no data is transferred for 60 seconds.
36601,Amazon EC2 V1,"Thanks, that's good to know. We push data (about 16Kb) every second so we shouldn't fall foul of this particular timeout.   Last night we were running 18 instances across 3 availability zones. The drops appeared to happen on all the instances in a particular zone at nearly the same time, but I'm not sure if this a coincidence (because the connections we created at pretty much the same time too) or due to the ELB. It's quite odd."
36601,Amazon EC2 V1,"Is there a way to figure out how many connections have been dropped on ELB?  Although 98%+ requests are served within 300ms, we have some requests that are slow - very very heavy on CPU and take some time to respond. 60 second is not enough time in many cases!  Would love to know and see if we have to switch to HAProxy or some other load balancer?"
36601,Amazon EC2 V1,"I thought I should probably update and close this thread for others that may see the same issues we were seeing.  The problems we were seeing was indeed due to the ELB, it seems that the ELB doesn't like sockets that are open for a long time, and will cut them off before they complete.  As we were using HTTP for delivery we worked around this problem by using the ELB to allocate an instance, the instance then issues an HTTP redirect upon connection to redirect the request to the instance's public IP address.  We subsequently bypass the ELB and transmit the required data via the instance's public IP address (this also reduces costs as data doesn't go via the ELB)."

Just curious about the stability of AWS services and if this is something that happens to people, even on occasion its not good for a production critical application...."
36590,Amazon EC2 V1,"blueplanetman,  Can you provide a little bit more information about what happened in your case? Do you have an instance ID or a Premium Support case opened?  The majority of the instance level issues that get posted to the AWS forums are usually resolved within an hour or less."
36590,Amazon EC2 V1,"It is not normal.  If we are down for even one minute, (""down"" defined on our own parameters), we are notified; hopefully then we'll be able to take action.  So an entire instance being ""down"" will certainly be caught.  Even if our web service chokes for some reason, low memory, application bug, etc., we'll know very quickly.   Note that AWS does not notify us though; AWS does not typically let folks know whether their instances are up or down ""automatically"".  Take a look at EC2 Cloud Watch which might work for you.  Also check out pingdom.com.  James"
36590,Amazon EC2 V1,"This instance  i-59dae23a as mentioned in a previous thread has been down for almost 48 hours.  All we are told is that we will be notified in the original thread when they have an update.  But other than being told that the EBS team is involved, we have no idea what is happening.  Obviously we could purchase premium support when we get ready for production, but this is troubling given the lack of information and the amount of time it has been down. Makes one rethink how stable the platform is.   Just sayin."
36590,Amazon EC2 V1,"blueplanetman,  The EBS team is still investigating this particular issue. Once we have more information from the team we will update your original thread here: https://forums.aws.amazon.com/message.jspa?messageID=331624#331624  In the mean time you should be able to snapshot your original volume to then create a new replacement volume for your instance. You may also find a force-detach of your volume useful if you have not tried this yet."
36590,Amazon EC2 V1,"Ok, I made snapshots, but cannot force detach the volumes from the instance, it just says that they are ""detaching"" but nothing seems to help."

36589,Amazon EC2 V1,"Unable to access image exported from Hyper-V I'm building a VM in Hyper-V, and after import with ec2-import-instance I can't RDP into the image.  The image is up and running and visible within the AWS Management Console, and it's running in a security group with 3389 Open.  I've verified that the image had RDP enabled and that Windows Firewall was configured to allow RDP Traffic from public networks.  Here's the command I used to import:  ec2-import-instance ./baseimage.vhd -t t1.micro -g IGC_Test1 -f VHD -a x86_64 -b IGC_Test1 -w ***** -o ****  Right now, I can see the instance running, with 2/2 status checks passed.  There is no Key Pair specified, but that's the only difference I see between this imported instance and an instance I created based on an existing AMI that I can access without issue.  Any ideas?  Should I re-export and import with Windows Firewall disabled?  I've verified I can RDP to the image while running in Hyper-V, for what that's worth.  Thanks, JC <- EC2 n00b"
36589,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi JC, Please make sure that RDP is enabled on the public profile of Windows Firewall. You mentioned possibly importing with the firewall disabled, have you already tried that with any success? Thank you, -Nikita"

36589,Amazon EC2 V1,"OK, I've sorted this out.  I think what I did wrong was export from Hyper-V incorrectly (or I pointed the upload tool at the wrong directory).  If you attempt to upload a base image vhd from a directory, and that directory contains more than one file (especially .avhd files), then you're importing from an proper export.  This is problematic if you've taken snapshots while building up your VM, which I had done.  JC"

I've also tried rebooting it once or twice, just incase the OS itself was having problems. Pulling up the console for the instance shows no problems.  Can you please advise.  Thanks."
36585,Amazon EC2 V1,Hi there I have examined your instance i-736f8619 and the underlying hardware and networking all look good. This still looks like a problem inside the OS of this instance.   As this instance is an instance-store type instance your only option now is to fail away from this instance and to start a replacement instance.  I am afraid that all the data on the ephemeral drives will need to be recovered from your most recent backups but the data on your attached EBS volumes should be persistent when you move them to a replacement instance.  I am sorry that we cannot do any more for this instance.  Thanks JasonM
36585,Amazon EC2 V1,Thanks for the reply Jason.  Looks like I have a bit of work to do... :P
36585,Amazon EC2 V1,That instance (ami-2d4aa444) has been shutting-down for some time now.  You may want to look into that.  Thanks.

36585,Amazon EC2 V1,This should now be resolved.
36585,Amazon EC2 V1,The instance is gone. Thanks. The volume (vol-dcd5c4b5) is still frozen detaching.  Thanks!

I've moved your instance to the stopped state, you are now free to start your instance which will move you to a new underlying host automatically."
36582,Amazon EC2 V1,"Thanks Luke,  The instance is now back up and ssh is working as well.  Is this host failure something that we might be able to get around on our own next time with a different approach?"
36582,Amazon EC2 V1,"Patrick M McGarry,  A host failure like this can re-occur in the future so it is possible this could happen to you again. One way many of our customers build redundancy with AWS is by utilizing Elastic LoadBalancing with the use of AutoScaling. If an instance were to fail in this type of environment it would then be replaced by another healthy instance.

36573,Amazon EC2 V1,"Question regarding Reserved Instance Hi, I have some question regarding Reserved Instances:  I have at the moment one Windows large on-demand Instance with one Volume (a specific application (IIS, MySQL) and data are exists on this Volume). If I now buy a Reserved Instance (Medium Utilization) can I easily attach the existing Windows Root Device (Volume) + Elastic IP to the new reserved Instance or did I must configure a new Elastic IP + Copy all data manually to the new reserved instance (Volume)?  Is it possible to switch something on this instance? (e.g. OS, Availability Zone, Volumes, IP, Security Groups, Type?)  When I need maybe more CPU/Memory Power for this Instance I have no possibilities to upgrade the Instance Type, right? But can I start a on demand instance and attach the volume + IP back again from the reserved instance to the on demand instance?  Thanks!"
36573,Amazon EC2 V1,"Remember that a ""reservation"" is really a pricing option; you pay up-front for a better hourly rate of an instance of a specific type, (say, m1.large), and an availability zone, (say, us-west-1a).  You can have as many EBS volumes as you desire, but, the ""pricing"" is tied to instance type/region/az, so if any of those change, that reservation pricing would not apply.  A reservation is not tied to any specific instance; if you have several instances that qualify for a single reservation pricing, the pricing only applies to one instance.  If you destroy one instance but there is still another qualifying instance, it would be priced at the reservation rate.  The only other point I should add is that ""heavy utilization"" causes 24/7/365 hourly charges, whether the instance is running or not; you basically commit to pay the reservation hourly rate as if the instance were continually running.

In terms of the parameters for ModifyNetworkInterfaceAttribute, the call supports the following fields:  NetworkInterfaceId - id of the interface to change, required Description.Value - to change the description SecurityGroupId.n - to change the set of security groups associated with the interface SourceDestCheck.Value - to change the sourceDestCheck value Attachment.AttachmentId - to change the deleteOnTermination flag Attachment.DeleteOnTermination - to change the deleteOnTermination flag  For Reset and Describe calls, you must use the Attribute=<attributeName> syntax. Reset only supports ""sourceDestCheck"" as the attribute to reset (resets the value to ""true""). Describe supports ""sourceDestCheck"", ""groupSet"", and ""description"".

36565,Amazon EC2 V1,"Instances in an entire ELB Availability Zone are Out of Service Greetings,  This is the second occurrence for me on 2 different accounts:  I have an ELB instance in eu-west-1 with backend instances (non autoscaled) on two availability zones. ELB is svc-prod-db.csnqjfkxl6bv.eu-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com.  We've had an increase in traffic the past few weeks and the maximum platform capacity was reached a week or so ago.  In order to increase capacity, I increased the number of instances yesterday (in equal number on both availability zones).  Since the original instances were saturated, I closed the service down and removed all instances from the ELB in order to allow the instances to recover.  And when I added the instances (both old and new) back to the ELB, only half the instances switched to 'In Service'. Those in eu-west-1b. All instances in eu-west-1a are 'Out of Service'.  Today the instances are still in the same state with regards to the ELB.  Instances are identical (c1.medium) and in the same security groups.  I've the same problem a month ago on another AWS account where the total incoming traffic was a lot bigger with the same result. The solution was to remove all instances from the non functioning availability zone and create new ones in the functioning one, but thus losing the high availability in case of catastrophic availability zone failure).  Any help as to what is happening with ELB or insights on what I am doing wrong, if anything, would be greatly appreciated.  Regards and thanks in advance."

36565,Amazon EC2 V1,"ok.  I removed the eu-west-1a availability zone yesterday since all the instances in it were Out of Service.  I indeed re-added the eu-west-1a AZ this morning in order to see if anything had changed but the instances stayed Out of Service for a while (maybe this was due to the Healthy Threshold x Health Check Interval time counter, but that doesn't make sense to me since all the instances were still in the ELB and should have been health-checked, traffic just not just forwarded to them, right ?), and I only noticed the status change when I rechecked after your first response.  Question: If I remove an AZ from an ELB, while still leaving instances in that AZ in the ELB, will the health checks still be made ? Will the instances be automatically declared as ""Out of Service"" ?  This does not explain, when all the instances and availability zones (eu-west-1a and eu-west-1b) were added to the ELB yesterday, why all the instances in the availability zone eu-west-1a were Out of Service and those from eu-west-1b weren't, even though all instances are identical and were, from my own checks, functioning properly.

36559,Amazon EC2 V1,"As far as I understand, this is the expected behavior. This command lists and describes the route tables matching certain parameters. In this specific case, you are asking for all route tables belonging to VPC vpc-xxxxxxxx, and you only want the ones containing a route for 10.1.0.0/16. There are two route tables matching your filter. Because this command queries for route tables, not individual entries, you get all data."

We also recommend setting up a static / reverse DNS record to map your email host name to an Elastic IP address. This will reduce the chances that your email server will be blacklisted in the future.  You can review the policy in the EC2 FAQ.  I hope this helps.  Darryll W. AWS Customer Service"

36548,Amazon EC2 V1,With my inquiry to billing I asked a question they couldn't (or didn't) answer. How much do GET or PUT requests cost? Also all my previous questions on this thread are unanswered.
36548,Amazon EC2 V1,"I have a similar issue. I started at the beginning of this month using the free tier for learning and evaluating purposes.At the first evening I launched and terminated 4 instances and launched and stopped a 5th instance, all using the same AMI ""Basic 32-bit Amazon Linux AMI 1.0"".When I looked at my account activity the next day I read that I used up 12800 gets when loading a snapshot meaning I have to pay 0.01 $ this month for the extra 2800 gets.Somewhere in documentation I found a few bits of information regarding snapshots: ""Transferring data to (PUT) or from (GET) a snapshot is done in chunks of 4 MB.""Doing the math: The Linux AMI needs 10 GB space = 10 * 1 GB = 10 * 1024 MB = 10240 MB10240 MB / (4 MB/GET) = 2560 GETSLaunching 5 instances = 5 * 2560 GETS = 12800 GETSWhat I make up of this: An AMI contains a snapshot; launching an instance from an AMI basically means that you make a copy of that snapshot when creating the EBS-volume attached to the instance.Unfortunately this is not mentioned anywhere explicitly and can lead to unexpected costs for ec2-newbies who want to try out the so-called free tier.While I appreciate the effort of amazon to provide this offer I also find the lack of cost control disturbing. There should always be a warning to a user if he does things which will cause him to leave the free tier zone.Amazon may generate a few extra-bucks from this omission but may also alienate a good part of their potential future customer base."

Thank you,"
36546,Amazon EC2 V1,Time drift is normal within virtual machines. Especially when the cpu core is shared by the hypervisor. The best thing to do is make sure that you are using network time to keep your time in sync.
36546,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi barells,  I don't know which instance you're encountering this with, but I'm guessing it's a Linux paravirtual instance (not Cluster Compute or Cluster GPU since those Linux instances are hvm instead of paravirtual).  Linux paravirtual instances will by default attempt to get their time from the physical host for the instance.  That time may be inaccurate or may appear to jump around from your instance's point of view.  You can change your instance's settings to no longer use the host's time and then use NTP to have accurate time keeping within your instance.  Please see this forum post for details of how to do that:  https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=173712  Best Regards, -Cindy"
36545,Amazon EC2 V1,"Incorrect time I notice this issue has been posted a few times with no real solution (that I could find, anyway), but thought it better to make my own thread than add to an old one.We are having an issue with incorrect time, it has now become so bad that myautomatic S3 synchronisations have stopped running. (ERROR: S3 error:403 (RequestTimeTooSkewed): The difference between the request time andthe current time is too large.)My instance clock is over 1000 seconds ahead of the real time, and youcan even see the gap increasing with requests to pool.ntp.org, seems tobe about 1 second per hour.I have tried the usual methods of setting the time manually but ofcourse these don't work as it should be taken care of automatically by theparent.Please could someone advise a way around this? It seems to be out of my control.Many thanks."
36545,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi,  I believe you can work around this using a kernel option that allows you to keep your own time:  Assuming that:  cat /proc/sys/xen/independent_wallclock  reports ""0"", you can update this variable using:  sudo sh -c 'echo 1 >/proc/sys/xen/independent_wallclock'  Could you try this and see if it helps?  If you have ntpdate installed, after this you can run:  /usr/sbin/ntpdate -s  to update your system clock.  Depending on how your boot scripts are set up, you may be able to make the change to ""/proc/sys/xen/independent_wallclock"" permanent by adding a line:  xen.independent_wallclock=1  to/etc/sysctl.conf.  Let us know how this goes.  Best, Dan"
36545,Amazon EC2 V1,"Dan,Thanks for your help - this worked perfectly. I had checked that file as a result of my searches but found no explanation of what it did so never thought to change it.It's a bit strange that the clock would go this far out of sync though.Chris"
36545,Amazon EC2 V1,"Dan, what is the underlying cause here? Why are some instances affected while others are not? AWS failing to provide an accurate clock unhelpfully adds to the list of things EC2 users need to think about to create robust systems. Furthermore, if the clock is actually moving at a rate faster than real time as Chris is reporting, this would be an incomplete solution."
36545,Amazon EC2 V1,"Just to update this, I checked the time on the instance again today - it's been almost 24 hours, and the clock had gained just under 7 seconds. Not quite as bad as I initially estimated, but still not very accurate.I am OK with this as can just setup automatic NTP sync once a week or something as my processes are not that time critical, but if there is anything I can do to assist with the resolution of the issue please let me know.Chris"

36545,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi,Thanks for the report, we'll check on this.Â  To add one more suggestion to this thread: if you set independent_wallclock as I've mentioned, it's probably a good idea to create a cron job to run ""<span>/usr/sbin/ntpdate -s"" about an hour to keep your clock synced over long periods of time.Best,Dan</span>"
36545,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi !I have encountered the same behaviour just after daylight saving time became active here (I used the local timzeone), in late March...As an alternative to running a cronjob everyweek, you can install a NTP deamon on your systems, and synchronize them to one (or more) external servers... Your clock will stay in sync as long as the daemon works. Of course, you still need to set independant_clock for this to work.My two cents..."
36545,Amazon EC2 V1,Thanks Dan. Please let us know what you find. It would be useful for us to know whether we will need to design our systems to periodically sync the clock or whether we can rely on the underlying physical clock. Unfortunately it sounds like the latter is the only safe thing to do.
36545,Amazon EC2 V1,Same problem here. The workaround suggest has worked for me too - thanks. It would be good to see the root cause fixed though.
36545,Amazon EC2 V1,"I'm having similar problems.  Just bumping this up (if that's even possible).  I'd like to see all servers running with accurate clocks.  I have one medium instance that's fine, but my small instance (which houses the db server) is fast by about 3 minutes, which is a pain."
36545,Amazon EC2 V1,"Don't use cron to periodically sync your instances' clocks.Â  Instead, run ntpd, the NTP daemon.Â  It keeps your clock within a few milliseconds of correct.Â  In each of my /etc/ntp.conf I have<blockquote>		server 0.us.pool.ntp.org		server 1.us.pool.ntp.org		server 2.us.pool.ntp.org		server 3.us.pool.ntp.org 		peer server1.my.com		peer server2.my.com		peer server3.my.com		peer server4.my.com</blockquote>Each instance is served by a different set of low-stratum external servers, and they all peer with each other.Â  (It's OK to name myself as a peer, so they can all share the same ntp.conf.)Does EC2 offer clocks in each availability zone, or at least in each region?Â  What are they called?Â  I should add those to my list of servers.

The machine I wanted to import was a Windows 2003 R2 op system with a VMDK file size of 14 GB. The import was split into approx 1360 parts. It took 2 days to import all the parts and after one week the task was still in ""available"" state. I was not able to start the created instance and the AMI was unavailable. I also called ec2-resume-import which completed with success.  My questions are: 1.Do you have any performance statistics? Are 2 days a normal time interval to upload ~1360 parts?  2. Do you have any ideas about why the task did not complete? 3. I tried a test with a smaller machine, 48 parts which fails with the following message: ClientError: No valid partitions.

36541,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi oostar,  1. Our statistics show that once we have received the image the rest of the conversion process typically takes less than 40 minutes. The amount of time it takes to upload a volume is primarily a function of your bandwidth and the size of the image.   If your connection is interrupted then the upload will stop. You should use ec2-resume-import to resume the upload.  Uploads that take 6 days almost always involve 1 of these factors: *Your volume is extremely large relative to your connection speed. *Your connection broke mid-upload and ec2-resume-import was not called for several days.  2. The larger import tasks failed with ""ClientError: No valid partitions. Not a valid volume.""  3. ""ClientError: No valid partitions. Not a valid volume."" signifies that the uploaded volume is likely missing the MBR or is corrupt. The presence of the MBR can depend highly on how the source image was created. Some image creation tools, particularly backup tools, will create a backup of the contents of the boot partition, while excluding the MBR and other information outside of that specific partition. Having no knowledge of your source environment, I would suggest using disk2vhd tool to create a VHD of your machine and try importing that. http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/ee656415 , if you use this tool, do not check ""prepare for use in virtual pc"".

I would like to experiment with a render farm using the Free Tier of a Windows 2008 R2 AMI.  The Queue Manager is listening for Render requests on my local network and I've got the Queue Manager accepting requests on another local physical machine on my network so I know Queue Manager is working properly.  Where I'm stuck is how to install the Queue Manager on an EC2 instance and have it accept render requests from my local machine as if it were on the local network?  Also, I've tried setting up a my local machine (Windows 7) to accept VPN connections, enabled the pptp protocol on my router, and setup the VPN connection on the EC@ instance but it just won't find my VPN network. To be honest Connecting EC2 via VPN to a home machine is another thread all on its own but it was one of the solutions I was exploring.  I think ideally all I need to do is allow computers on my local network to ""see"" the EC2 instance as if it were connected locally.  Any thoughts or help on this one would be greatly appreciated.  Cheers,  ~ Ryan"

I've got a thread going on my Renderosity.com forum and some one suggested that the different Queue Manager instances on the local intranet might be using UDP packets to find each other.  The problem with connecting the EC2 instance via VPN however is that the VPN protocol or settings generally don't forward or out right ignore UDP packets.  More info as I learn more about this."
36538,Amazon EC2 V1,AWS Cluster instance Hi   I am doing some performance test in the EC2 cloud. I initially created few m1.xlarge instance and ran few cluster test. The test took 23 minutes few time and 2 hours few times. There is no issue with CPU and Memory since it's dedicated resources. So we thought the network bandwidth be the problem for test taking longer time.   We then created few cc1.4xlarge to overcome the problem. However when I run the same test in cluster instance it takes even more time than regular instance. Again memory and cpu is normal. I do see the EBS write latency takes 80-100ms sometimes.   I expected the test to run faster than non-clustered instance type. But it turned out to be wrong. I am not sure whether I need to tune the Amazon linux for cluster setup. Can you please let me know the reason for the slowness?  Thanks

The message said something similar to Failed to spawn ssh main process: unable to execute: No such file or directory"" I can't get the exact message since after doing a stop/start the ""Get System Log"" returns empty screen""  What does one do if the SSH fails on the instance. How does one ever connect? Any fixes / diagnosis to ssh / common problems. Also why is the system log empty?"
36536,Amazon EC2 V1,"lci_user,  The instances are running, and are listening on some ports, which indicates that the AWS services supporting your instances are healthy, but the OS may be experiencing issues.  The system logs are basically console output for the current VM holding your instance, and when you stop/start an instance, that old VM and its output are no longer current to your instance, and the new console output from your new instance should be shown. This can take a bit of time to populate.  I see the following error message:  init: Failed to spawn ssh main process: unable to execute: No such file or directory  This may indicate that there has been an issue with the filesystem, or with the SSH configuration. I recommend collecting more information from your system logs by detaching the root volumes from them and attaching them to another instance for examination. I would look for SSH configuration issues, missing files, or other configuration changes. You may also want to review the disk for any other issues, though I see that they are performing normally.  If you see anything that indicates an issue with AWS services, please make note of it here.  Regards,  Anthony"

36535,Amazon EC2 V1,"Joining EC2 Windows Instance to domain - instance becomes inaccessible I have tried this both within a VPC and outside of VPC, doesn't seem to make a difference.  I launch a Windows Server 2008 instance, wait for it to provision, assign it an elastic IP, and connect to with with RDP.  Establish a PPTP VPN connection back to our main office, join the instance to our Active Directory domain, and reboot.  Upon rebooting, the instance is not accessible via RDP.  (Connections either time out or are refused.)  If I add a second network adapter to the instance (without assigning it an EIP), I can now connect via RDP, but my VPN connection back to the office fails.  Also, network performance slows to a crawl after adding the PPTP VPN connection.  Where the RDP connection was snappy and responsive before, you can now watch it draw each section of the screen and the connection is almost unusable.  Anyone have any ideas?"
36535,Amazon EC2 V1,"Another couple interesting tidbits:  No matter whether I assign an EIP to the second network adapter or not, Windows reports that the second network connection has no internet connectivity.  In fact, I just tried to ""repair"" the connection and it released its DHCP IP address and cannot renew it.  If I force the second network adapter to detach from the instance, I maintain my RDP connection to the instance for about 15 seconds and then it logs me off automatically.  Sometimes after removing the second adapter it will let me connect back to the instance with RDP, and other times it will not.  In my most recent attempt, it let me start an RDP connection but hung partway through the logon process (at ""please wait for the group policy client""), then disconnected, and will not let me reconnect.  It appears the instance may have crashed and is rebooting itself because the AWS management console reports that 1/2 checks passed.  (System status check passed, instance status check failed.)

As you are running a RedHat AMI by default the IP tables firewall is enabled by default in addition to the Amazon AWS Security groups. you will need to log onto this instance and either add iptables rules to permit traffic on port 80 if you have already installed your web server.  for the purposes of testing you can disable the ip tables using the following command once you have connected to this instance via SSH. sudo /etc/init.d/iptables stop  Your instance will still be protected by the Security groups firewall.

36522,Amazon EC2 V1,Hi there the underlying hardware from where your instance is running is operating normally. I would suggest as next steps that you make a backup of the EBS boot volume on this instance using the AWS console and volumes snapshot tool.  Once you have made a snapshot of your instances root volume (vol-1d8ebf71) then issue a stop/start of this instance. As this is a EBS backed instance the data will  persistent on the EBS volume. Please note when you start this instance again you will need to re-associate the current elastic ip address back to it again.  Your instance should be reachable again after this stop/start. When it boots you should be able to review the instance logs to see if you can determine why it stopped responding.  Thanks JasonM

36521,Amazon EC2 V1,If you are using an AMI which support cloud-init (Amazon Linux and Ubuntu based AMIs support it) you can pass a script in the user-data part when creating a new instance.

36520,Amazon EC2 V1,Unfortunately it is not currently possible to do this since an EC2 instance doesn't have an ARN (Amazon Resource Name) and the security in AWS services is based on that.  You might want to consider using some kind of a management software such as enStratus which can abstract the regular console and allow much finer grained security.

36516,Amazon EC2 V1,"instance stuck pending - probably caused by AMI unavailability My instance i-3682a854 is stuck in pending state (for aprox. 8 hours now). Instance details says the AMI is unavailable. I have used standard Win2008R2 AMI (ami-f31ccb9a) to create the instance. I have the another instance based on the AMI and it is up and running.  But all my instances are reproting the AMI as unavailable in its property pane. Any ideas ?  Edited by: lra73 on Mar 26, 2012 1:05 AM"
36516,Amazon EC2 V1,... everything is OK .. automagically ... it seems even the amazon instances need holidays. It was a gentle reminder to backup the image.
36516,Amazon EC2 V1,Hi there I am glad to see that you are operational again. We would  strongly suggest that you make regular backups of Windows instances to AMI's so that in the event a software up or change breaks something you can quickly recover from an custom AMI you have in reserve.  Thanks JasonM
36515,Amazon EC2 V1,"How can I convert my instance from large to medium or small? I'd like to change my instance from a large to a medium but leave the database, web config files, etc intact. Is this possible or do I loose my local storage when converting instance sizes? I've seen some info on how to do this using the console, but which console is everyone referring to and where is it? (I'm assuming it's not the console in windows). Thanks!"
36515,Amazon EC2 V1,"You can do this right through the Amazon web interface:  Cleanly shut down your instance. Create an AMI from your instance. Launch a new instance from the AMI, during which you can choose a new size.   There are other ways of course, but this is probably the easiest."
36515,Amazon EC2 V1,"If I go to stop my instance through the web console, I get the message 'Please note that any data on the ephemeral storage of your instance will be lost when it is stopped.' - so I assumed I would loose my data. Did I interpret this incorrectly or did you mean to shut down the instance through the instance itself? Thanks for your help!"
36515,Amazon EC2 V1,"From your AWS Management Console click on EC2 tab,  look under your Elastic Block Store and confirm that the volumes attached to this instance are EBS based. If so, your data will be there when you restart the instance. You can change instance type once instance is shut down. Right click a stopped instance and choose Change Instance Type."
36515,Amazon EC2 V1,Only if you are using instance storage and have data stored on the instance store volumes. You may want to post the output of the df -h command if you dont know whether or not you are using it.
36515,Amazon EC2 V1,Here are some additional things to note. This will only work for EBS backed instances as when you try to stop an Instance-store backed instance you will see it only has two states Running and Terminated.  Also with any change to a live production system we would always recommend that you take steps to make sure that in  you do have an issue that you can recover from the process.  Please note that a stop/start of your instance will change it's external address and you will need to re-associate an elastic ip address back to it if you are using them.  So in the case of you instance we would recommend that you make snapshots of EBS drives and any potential data that is stored on ephemeral drives is also backed up to an alternative location such as S3 or other EBS volumes. It is also advisable that you make an AMI of any instances that you have spent time customizing.  The above is only precautionary and is more recommended best practices   Thanks JasonM
36514,Amazon EC2 V1,"Damaged volume We are having a problem with our instance i-3e75a749 that is not able to boot with its volume vol-a04ea9c8. Trying to create an snapshot of the volume reports an error of ""An internal error has occurred"", which is in my opinion the demonstration the volume is corrupted for some reason. Can you please double check volume status on eu-west-1b zone?  Thank you."
36514,Amazon EC2 V1,"Just to give more details, the problem is not in the instance itself, since creating a new instance and mounting the volume gives the same error. The machine status gets on pending, and after some secconds on stopping. The reason reported on stoping is Client.InstanceInitiatedShutdown  Using the same instance with a newly created volume works fine too.  On http://status.aws.amazon.com stays the zone eu-west-1b is operating normally, and the status check of the volume says Okay.  Any hint?"
36514,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi,  I'm engaging the EBS team to look into your volume.   Regards, Preethi"
36514,Amazon EC2 V1,"Thank you preethi@AWS. Please, come back to me when you have an answer.  Regards."
36514,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi,  The volume should be available to use now. Please try to attach the volume and start the instance again.  Regards, Preethi"
36514,Amazon EC2 V1,Thank you. Instance is running fine again.
36514,Amazon EC2 V1,"Can you please give me the reason of the problem, or any hints to avoid it happening again?  Best regards."
36513,Amazon EC2 V1,"direct traffic destine to elastic ip address to EC2 instance Since we can't associate elastic IP address to any particular EC2 instance more than 1 IP at a time.

Thanks, Berm  Edited by: bermmerb on Mar 26, 2012 10:58 PM"
36513,Amazon EC2 V1,"As an EC2 instance can have a single public IP address only, you won't be able to use multiple Elastic IP addresses. The Elastic IP address needs to be attached to your instance in order to work. There is no way to handle traffic to an IP address not associated with any instance."
36512,Amazon EC2 V1,"Cluster group size limits? Is there a fixed limit to the number of (hpc) instances that can be launched in a cluster group?  (I thought I saw something about this somewhere, but can't find it now.)  I'd also like to know what size cluster groups are actually being used.  The largest I've tried so far is a cluster of 10 cc2.8xlarge.  I may have a need for a larger number and I don't want to resort to trial and error to determine what's actually possible.  thanks"
36512,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hello,  The following information can be found in the ""Using Cluster Instances"" section of our EC2 User Guide:  When determining the number of cluster instances you can launch, be aware that you're limited to a maximum of eight cluster GPU instances (there's no limit on cluster compute instances) and 20 total EC2 instances, by default. If you need more instances, go to the ""Request to Increase Amazon EC2 Instance Limit"" form at aws.amazon.com/contact-us/ec2-request.  The Using Cluster Instances section should also address your related questions.  I hope you find this information helpful.  Regards, JBrown"
36512,Amazon EC2 V1,Thanks.  Do you know what the largest (non-gpu) cluster launched has been? I'd like get some idea as to the practical limit on cluster size.
36511,Amazon EC2 V1,Instance restart with out any reson It looks like my instance i-5b7b983f restarted with out any reason. How this happened? Is there anyway i can prevent it?  Thanks
36511,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi masterhub,  Checking on instance i-5b7b983f, I see that about 19 hours ago the underlying physical host for the instance became unresponsive.  The host was rebooted in an effort to restore responsiveness.  When the host came back up after the reboot, this would have caused your instance to have been rebooted as well.  Issues with hosts, such as this, do occur from time to time.  It is important that you consider this when architecting your application.  You may also want to read and implement some of the best practice steps recommended in the following AWS whitepapers:  http://d36cz9buwru1tt.cloudfront.net/AWS_Cloud_Best_Practices.pdf http://d36cz9buwru1tt.cloudfront.net/AWS_Building_Fault_Tolerant_Applications.pdf http://d36cz9buwru1tt.cloudfront.net/AWS_Web_Hosting_Best_Practices.pdf  Kind Regards, -Cindy"

36508,Amazon EC2 V1,"EC2 Micro Instances on AWS Free Tier Hi,  I have just recently signed-up with AWS Free Tier. I would like to ask how many micro instances you are allowed to launch or create during this ""free period"".  jongbergs"
36508,Amazon EC2 V1,"As many as you like, but you will pay for any compute time exceeding 750 hours.  Also if you have more than 10GB of EBS volumes active at any given time, you will be billed for that also."
36508,Amazon EC2 V1,"Info page says that free tier includes:  * 750 hours of windows micro instance  * 750 hours of linux micro instance  The questions are:  * does this mean that I can run 1 windows and 1 linux micro instances for free?  * does ""linux"" means any unix based OS such as ubuntu for example?"
36508,Amazon EC2 V1,"Yes, it does mean both of those things. That is exactly what I am doing: 1 Windows t1.micro instance, and 1 Ubuntu t1.micro instance.  Keep in mind, though, that if these instances generate > 2,000,000 I/O requests, that will begin accruing minuscule charges on a separate line item. Mine are doing about 3.5 million I/O's per month, which costs about $0.15.  Also, if you use the Quick Launch Wizard, like I did, to bring up a standard 64-bit Windows Server for your Windows micro instance, that comes with a 30 GB system disk volume. Add an Ubuntu instance (8 GB), and you are now 8 GB over your allotted 30 GB EBS volume limit. That 8 GB overage costs about $0.80/month.  So in all likelihood you won't get off completely scot-free if you run both instance 24/7. It'll be ~$1/month."

36502,Amazon EC2 V1,"Everything is fine; the snapshot cannot be deleted because an AMI considers it ""part of the AMI"".  This warning should be greeted with a ""thank you"".  IF you deleted the snapshot, the AMI would be invalid, and could not be launched as an instance.  (An AMI is the AMI itself, plus one or more snapshots that represent the ""volume(s)"" that are part of that AMI.)  To create as snapshot of an existing volume, just create the snapshot.  There are considerations when the ""write activity"" on the volume is active; you might want to tings to ensure a consistent snapshot.  You can create an AMI from a running instance; the simple answer is that you would be able to launch one/many clones of that instance from that AMI.  The reality is that you need to ensure the AMI is ""consistent"", so search the forums for suggestions.  But, the principle is correct.  James"
36502,Amazon EC2 V1,"But I'm trying to prune old snapshots as part of my backup. I'm creating daily snapshots and only want the last 7 days. Perhaps its because I'm trying to delete the first snapshot, the one generated originally?  How do people backup volumes with snapshots without pruning?"

36502,Amazon EC2 V1,"Of course I read your question... and I tried to help.  I do my best.  (No pleasing some folks...)  Anyway, I like your solution, and used a similar technique myself when writing a little snapshot tool that I could call via a scheduler.  Since the ""description"" for a snapshot associated with AMI creation is pretty well known, it can be used to avoid trying to ""prune"" those snapshots.  Even if you did try to delete snapshots associated with an AMI, you might trap for that exceptions?  (I use a very recent C# API or my backup/snapshot/prune command-line utility.)  You might also consider using a very well-known description format for the snapshots you create programatically, i.e., those that are candidates for automated pruning.  Then, only consider those.  A nice feature you might easily add; examine the ""tags"" too.  You can then define a tag name, such as ""permanent"" so that at any time you can add that tag to any snapshot to prevent you program from pruning it even it would ordinarily be a candidate for pruning.  You code would just look for a tag named ""permanent"" with a value of ""true"", or any name/value tag combination you like.  James"

36494,Amazon EC2 V1,"Low cost for idle CPU time I work a lot with BOINC (distributed computing). Most BOINC projects are CPU intensive. Most BOINC participants would like to have an affordable way to increase their participation without doubling their air conditioning bill.If there were a way to collect idle CPU time, and make it available at a lower cost, then I think you could sell a lot of instances. What I have in mind is an instance definition that would guarantee some minimum level of performance, but be essentially preemptable for periods of time. So, for example, an instance type that gives you a guaranteed 20% of a small's CPU time, and more then that if it happens to be available. From what I can see, it looks like a small instance gets a fixed fraction on a physical CPU, whether there is any threads needing CPU or not. This implies there are often half CPUs out there unused. So either 4 or 5 of these instances could be created on a single CPU, or perhaps 2 could run on a spare half... ideally, a hypervisior would detect idle smalls and allocate less CPU time slices to them, and grant them to this new instance type.I really don't know how your machine virtualization technology works, but if you could get the cost down, making such an instance type available might a great way to cover fixed costs in the data center and help a number of BOINC projects meet their goals.The idea here is to fully utilize existing blades, not to buy more and market them in this way."

36494,Amazon EC2 V1,"I have configured BOINC in an EC2 instance. It is pretty easy. If you've configured BOINC on a Windows machine, then you already have the knowledge needed.  1. Launch an EC2 instance.  Use the Quick Launch Wizard to select a ""Microsoft Windows Server 2008 Base"" configuration, and make sure to select 64-bit (which will enable you to run this in a High-CPU spot instance later). I'd recommend using a Standard Small Instance (m1.small) since it is cheap, just to do this initial configuration. Shouldn't take more than an hour or two at most ($0.12-$0.24).  2. Use Remote Desktop Connection to log in to this new instance, as per Amazon's instructions.  3. Open Internet Explorer and download BOINC from http://boinc.berkeley.edu/download.php  4. Install BOINC  5. Attach to whatever projects you are interested, using your appropriate Teams Names and USER IDs.  6. Set all projects to ""No New Work,"" and abort any work units in progress (we want BOINC to be task-free before we take a snapshot).  7. Right-click on your running instance in the AWS Management Console and select ""Create Image (EBS AMI)"" This will take a snapshop of your system and create the AMI (Amazon Machine Image) which you will use for your spot instances.  8. Once the AMI is created, you can terminate this Small instance. You now have an image of a Windows 2008 Server complete with your configured BOINC setup, all frozen and ready-to-go.  9. To start a spot instance, go to ""Instances -> Spot Instances -> Request Spot Instance"" in the AWS Management Console. Pick your newly-created AMI from the ""My AMIs"" tab. Then I recommend picking a High-CPU Medium instance (c1.medium). I've found that this is the most efficient instance in terms of BOINC production / cost (I run PrimeGrid only, so other apps may have different results...) Then pick your bid price, and wait for the instance to spawn. Once it does, RDP into it and just change your projects to ""Allow New Work.""  Congratulations, you are now running a BOINC instance on the spot market.  Note that if your instance terminates, either by your own hand or by the spot price rising above your bid, you will lose all data. I recommend working on short Work Units for this reason. Otherwise you could lose hours or days of crunching due to a termination."

If I then do a ec2-unmonitor-instances, I see monitoring-disabled using ec2-describe-instances but the mgmt console switches to saying ""Basic"".   This is all very confusing for 3rd party applications that want to programmatically control the monitoring state....do the API developers have a state machine design for monitoring state (enabled/disabled, Basic/Detailed)?

I recently built an instance based on the new Ubuntu 11.10 AMIs that show up in main QuickStart tab of the Launch Wizard (ami-895069fd).  Once my instance was up and running, I tried to do what I imagine would be an very common task, simply to use samba/cifs to mount a remote windows share.  Since I want support for more than just plain old ascii characters in my path and file names, I specified ""iocharset=utf8"" in my mount options.  Trying to mount fails with the error:  mount error(79): Can not access a needed shared library Refer to the mount.cifs(8) manual page (e.g. man mount.cifs)  and syslog shows: kernel: ... CIFS VFS: CIFS mount error: iocharset utf8 not found  With a little digging, I found that mounting a windows share with utf8 support requires a kernel module ""nls_utf8.ko"", and it seems support for that module was not included in the kernel built in this AMI.  Since this is such a common need, wouldn't it be a good idea to include this in the kernel?  Thanks  Edit: I've since tried a few other AMIs and I ran into the same problem.

36479,Amazon EC2 V1,"This configuration will achieve the desired effect, however the policy (trigger) is not required.  When an Auto Scaling policy executes, it modifies the group's desired-size.  However with both min and max set at 1, your group's desired-size is locked in at 1 (no policy will be able to change it).   The host replacement behavior you're after is provided by Auto Scaling's health-check feature, which terminates unhealthy instances and launches a replacement if the group's actual-size has fallen below the desired-size.  Let us know if you have further questions! -Eric"
36479,Amazon EC2 V1,Awesome! Thanks Eric!
36479,Amazon EC2 V1,"Is this still true and could you elaborate on it? I've got a similar environment with a Min / Max of 1, and if I disable tomcat on the instance, it goes unhealthy and the environment transitions from GREEN to YELLOW to RED and says it has zero healthy instances.  However, it never terminates the unhealthy instance nor does it spin a new one up. I've verified that ""Automatically Terminate Unhealthy Instances"" is set to true, though this should be default anyway. I've tried a bunch of different things and I'm really struggling to obtain what seems like it should be really simple behavior: maintain 1 healthy instance.  Thanks for any help!"
36479,Amazon EC2 V1,"Auto Scaling provides two different types of health-checks, EC2 and ELB (Elastic Load Balancer).  Elastic Beanstalk configures your environment's AutoScalingGroup to use the EC2 health-check.  This check considers the instance as healthy so long as EC2 indicates the instance is in the ""running"" state (so, not ""terminating"" or ""terminated"").  EC2 is not aware of the health of the software running on the instance, such as Tomcat.  AutoScalingGroups can also be configured to use ELB health-check.  This check considers the instance healthy when ELB also considers it healthy.  You can configure the ELB to periodically send health-probing requests to the Tomcat running on each instance.  If those probes fail, then ELB will consider the instance unhealthy.  An AutoScalingGroup configured with ELB health-check would then consider the instance unhealthy, and replace it.  Changing an AutoScalingGroup's configured health-check can be accomplished with Auto Scaling's ""as-update-auto-scaling-group"" CLI command.  Settings for the ELB health-check probes can be configured through the console or the ELB CLI.  Please let us know if you have further questions. -Eric@AWS"
36479,Amazon EC2 V1,"Thanks for the detailed response Eric! Indeed, using the ELB health check seems to behave as expected.  However, my understanding is that this isn't persisted as part of the Beanstalk configuration, so a rebuilding of the environment will result in a new auto-scaling group that wouldn't have this health check. Is this correct? If so, it is definitely more useful than nothing, though it would be great to at some point have this available in the environment configuration to avoid that. For now we'll have to have a cron or startup script on the box that ensures this option is set via the API.  Thanks again, Mike"
36479,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi Mike,  You are correct. Rebuilding your Elastic Beanstalk environment will remove the ELB health check setting. We will look into incorporating the ELB health check into the set of configuration settings for an environment or allow you to persist it in the future.  In the meantime, you can create a script that rebuilds the environment and as soon as the environment is ready, you can then call the Auto Scaling command line interface to change the health check type. Here is a link to the Elastic Beanstalk command line interface: http://aws.amazon.com/code/AWS-Elastic-Beanstalk/6752709412171743 and the Auto Scaling command line interface: http://aws.amazon.com/developertools/Amazon-EC2/2535.

Here is my situation, I have several running instances (Windows Server 2008), I created images through ""Create Image  (EBS AMI)"" menu from the running instances. Volumes and Snapshots are created and attached to the instances. Here is the question - How do I  transfer those EBS AMI images (volumes/snapshot, etc) to S3 and/or local drive. The root device for the images is EBS. There are several posts indicated that Snapshot are store in S3, but I do not see anything in my S3 to indicate that Snapshot is stored there.

I've already submitted the rDNS form request, about 10 days ago <https://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/html-forms-controller/contactus/ec2-email-limit-rdns-request> and didn't have any answer yet. Our production e-mail server was moved to Amazon and we've been spammed since, and waiting for ""the"" solution that never came. What do we need to do to get our rDNS working?  I'm anxiously waiting for your answer.  Best regards, Richard."
36470,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hello Richard,  I found the form you submitted and I'm seeing it was for SES Sending limits. I apologize that inquiry hasn't been resolved. I will check with the representative that handled that case.   I have removed EC2 sending limits from your account. In order to process the RDNS portion please fill out this form.   Also, from your past request I'm seeing, the PTR record you provided appears to be a URL and not an e-mail host name. If you set up a reverse DNS entry for your mail server, automated systems may be less likely to see it as dynamic. Also, most anti-spam organizations will reject the whitelisting request for not referencing a static mail server. You may want to revise your request to point to the specific mail server host name. (For example, mail.yourdomain.com.)  I hope this information helps!  Kit B."

I've posted the form twice now, one for SES and the another one for rDNS (more then a week ago), which I'm still waiting to get updated.

Please go ahead and fill out the RDNS request again for me, and I will personally look for it and process it, and then reach out to you via email once it's complete.   Once we process a Reverse DNS Request it can take up to 1 week to process at the latest.   I look forward to your request.   Kit B."

36466,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hello.  Your logs entries points to the instance having more connections that it can handle by the guest OS, effectively dropping connections and this could explain the DNS issue you are having, can you please check if the traffic that you are seeing is normal and/or expected. (sometimes this could be related to DNS servers getting a lot of DNS clients requests, p2p traffic, torrent traffic or high load of http request).  Can you please check that you are using an up to date version of the kernel, other steps that you could take is to reduce the timeout for idle connections or increase the maximum number of active connections, however, please do not do this in a production server without testing it before.  you can run this commands:  sysctl net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_max   sysctl net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_count  and compare the output to be sure that the issue is related to the max number of connections.

36465,Amazon EC2 V1,"Transactional Email from Web Application with AutoScaling: Can it be Done? We're interested in setting up a typical multi-tier site with ELB/Web Tier/DB Tier.  See, e.g., http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/gettingstarted/latest/wah-linux/getting-started.html  Our web application will be installed on AMIs on the web tier.  It is a php application that sends transactional email, such as when the user signs up or makes a purchase, and each web AMI must be configured with an MTA, such a Postfix, for the web application to send the necessary email.    We're also interested in implementing Autoscaling.  We will configure Postfix and other mail programs on each web AMI and make it a custom AMI.  With Autoscaling, we will create and terminated our web AMIs based upon CPU usage.    When the web applications create mail, we'd like to relay it to a local mail server on an EC2 AMI.  We then would like to route the mail in the queue to a mail delivery service such as SendGrid for delivery to recipients.    We understand how to configure a local mail server. See, e.g., http://flurdy.com/docs/postfix/  We also understand that we need to submit an application so that AWS will open port 25 and remove or change the limitation on email that can be sent.  See https://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/html-forms-controller/contactus/ec2-email-limit-rdns-request  Here are our questions: 1)  When a new web AMI is created with Autoscaling: a) is port 25 closed? b) are there any limitations on the quantity of email that can be relayed to the local mail server? c) does AWS require that a request form be submitted for each of these new web AMIs (which seemingly defeats the purpose of Autoscaling)?  2)  With respect to the Local Mail server that will queue the email relayed from the web AMIs and forward to SendGrid, what restrictions, if any, will remain in place on the quantity of email even after the request form has been submitted and approved?  3) Do the questions raised in above in No. 1 have different answers if the relay from the web AMIs is done within a VPC?  4) Are there alternate or better ways to configure the architecture to allow for transactional email with AutoScaling on AWS?  Thanks in advance."
36465,Amazon EC2 V1,"The best way to do this is configure your web amis to forward directly to sendgrid with this nothing should be queued on your local instances. If you want, you way want to investiage a job queue as a means of sending email.  In my experience, if you are sending alot of email, more machines = faster. At the moment i sent out 100k emails each week from a single instance through sendgrid, it usually takes all day. I am going to rewrite that to use a job queue to have the sending take place on multiple instances in small batches."
36465,Amazon EC2 V1,"Thanks for that input, D. Johansson.  I understand that you are recommending to send the email directly to SendGrid without the local mail server.  Regardless of whether we use a local server, does AWS require a request form  to send email and open port 25 for each web AMI?  And if so, how can that be accomplished with AutoScaling?"
36465,Amazon EC2 V1,"You could look into using SES to send your emails.  If you used this, your app would use the Amazon SDK tools to send the email, instead of traditional MTA.

36461,Amazon EC2 V1,"Elastic IP addresses/SSL... I'm just learning about Amazon's AWS offerings.  From what I understand, if I want a static IP address attached to my EC2 instance, I set up an ""elastic"" IP address which I then associate with my instance.  That ""elastic"" IP address is then an externally routable address.  What I'm wanting to do is set up https access to the instance, through a domain name which I own.  I already have an SSL cert through my current hosting provider.  Since I'm wanting to move this domain name over to my AWS instance, it should still work, right?  All I have to do is (1) get the instance to serve the (old) certificate and (2) get the domain name to resolve to the new elastic IP address on AWS.  (Also set up mod_ssl on the instance, but that's outsize the scope of what I'm asking here.)  Do I even need a static IP address for this to work?  I know my old hosting provider required a unique, static IP address, since it was a shared hosting environment, and HTTPS didn't know which server to route to when an HTTPS request came through a shared IP address.  Thanks for any replies!  Edited by: Timothy L Skoch on Mar 26, 2012 7:26 AM"
36461,Amazon EC2 V1,"You dont actually need an elastic IP address, as all instances (outside of vpc) get a public ip address.  Now, the problem that is if you stop/start your instance, you will end up with a new IP address and need to update your DNS to a new one. Elastic IPs make this easier as all you need to do when you stop/start an instance is to reassociate your existing elastic IP address.  You are right about everything else."

36443,Amazon EC2 V1,"Having Performance Issues with EC2 and Basic Web Setup We have a fairly simple and standard 5 server web deployment stood up in the AWS EC2 environment.  They consist of:  1 HAProxy box 							Ubuntu (natty) 64-bit 		m2 xLarge instance 3 Web Servers running    Varnish, nGinX 1.13, PHP5				Ubuntu (lucid) 64-bit           m1 xLarge instance 1 MySQL box running    MariaDB 5.4							CentOS 64-bit			m2 2xLarge instance  The test consists of very lightweight flat HTML files and small PHP scripts to test base line speed.  During performance loads what we see is:   The HAProxy box never uses more than 5% CPU and 120M RAM The Web servers never use more than 2% CPU and 100M RAM MySQL is completely idle. And we can never get to more than about 800 HTTP requests (about 450 connections/second) before the network drops requests.   However, according to various system monitors (iostat, New Relic server monitoring, bwm) we never seem to get more than about 60Mbit on the HAProxy box.  This is very reproducible with a large set of tools:   ApacheBench (ab), used multiple times during the last several days as sort of a raw test. Httperf and Autobench, used between 3pm-5pm yesterday and 10:30 this morning. The Blitz.IO service configured to run between 1-1000 users over 60 seconds launching the test from Virginia.   All of them shows the exact same results with the exact same performance over multiple days.    Also, we performed iPerf tests for low level network yesterday and seeing 340-390MBits on an m1 small and 716-818MBits on an m1 large.  We did this multiple times during the day yesterday evening.    The awful speeds we're seeing seems to be constrained to HTTP traffic.  These are bog standard installs with the code pulled from Ubuntu repos (nGinx's repo for nGinx to get a better version) and some very simple HTML and PHP files.  Although the database is listed, there were no POSTs tested so we had no database traffic.  This is pure serving content from HAProxy -> Varnish and back.  These numbers are concerning.  Please help!"

36439,Amazon EC2 V1,"If its ebs backed you should never need to recreate it. Depending on the cause of the issue a reboot or start/stop should solve most issues.  If this is happening frequently, you probably want to check the console log to see if you are getting any out of memory or kernel crashes.  If this is happening occasionally, you may be on a degraded host and you can stop/start an ebs backed instance to move to a new host."
36439,Amazon EC2 V1,"Thanks for the response.  I have rebooted and started/stopped the instance twice. When I try to get a log, it shows nothing which tells me there is something hanging.  Degraded hardware? That is something I do not understand from Amazon, we're paying our fees and we have our instances running on ""degraded hardware""? That is ridiculous on Amazon's part to do this. They charge by the hour but you can't use the instance. And if you recreate it, etc. you still need to pay for the time that unusable instance ran."
36439,Amazon EC2 V1,"Maybe you need to reconsider your statement, and alternatives to AWS. AWS Cloudwatch provides tools to allow you to be notified when issues arise with a particular service, and institute appropriate remedial actions."
36439,Amazon EC2 V1,"We are on ap-northeast-1a (japan) so it might be different than US availability zones. First week of launch, came to work at 8am in China to find my app server down. Turned out to be a hanging instance: shows up but no response. Hopefully you have a monitor page that returns success, our basic nagios will tell us cpu/memory/harddisc but we had to create a special page that shows app server is up. Second one was two weeks ago, my QA service (running on a micro instance) was hanging. Again had to force stop several times and put question on Forums for AWS engineers to knock some sense into the vm.   so that's two instances hung in 3 months. Just google ""ec2 instance hang"", its not if but when your instance hangs.   I love aws but we don't have the engineering department to create multiple tomcat instances load balanced using primary and warm standby postgresql database. Better for us to put the entire app/db on a big piece of iron at Rackspace, at least they provide 24/7 tier 1 support.  For our next launch I will be architecting for failure so that will be a different setup."
36439,Amazon EC2 V1,"Micro instances have a burstable CPU profile and can easily run into situations where CPU is maxed out. Cloudwatch should show CPU at 100%. When this happens, your instance will likely not respond to ssh or not respond very quickly.  Host failures do happen occasionally. I run around 20 instances and have only seen it happen a couple of times over a year a half. For me recovering in this situation is mostly automatic. Either stop/start or terminating an instance in an autoscale group.  Issues such as memory exhaustion or kernel crashes can be harder to diagnose. Sometimes it can happen very quickly before any metrics or logs are recorded."

A fix for this issue is to modify the registry key as shown here:  HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\TimeZoneInformation RealTimeIsUniversal = 0  Also, please note that this only affects those time zones that use Daylight Saving Time. You can achieve the same result by deleting the RealTimeIsUniversal registry entry because its default value is zero (0) when not specified.

I can see the host is listening on port 80  I also have an elastic IP that I have associated with this instance  On Route 53, in the record set, I point my site (let's call it myhw.com) to this IP address as an A record  On command line, nslookup for myhw.com yields the IP address, but not for www.myhw.com  On browser, http://<IP address>/index.html does not give me anything.  Apache logs are not hit, which means my request is not even going to the server.  I am thinking something is not set up right on DNS/Route 53  Any thoughts?  Thanks, Satheesh"

If you created a record for ""myhw.com"", that won't cover www or any other subdomain.  On browser, http://<IP address>/index.html does not give me anything.  When you launched the EC2 instance, you selected a security group. If you are using the AWS Management Console, click ""Security Groups"" on the left hand side. Select your security group from the list and switch to the ""Inbound"" tab. Check if there is a rule allowing access to port 80 (HTTP). If not, you will want to add a new one. Select ""HTTP"" and hit ""Add Rule"" followed by ""Apply Rule Changes""."

36432,Amazon EC2 V1,"You verified that there is a security group rule present for HTTP/port 80, right? Otherwise the requests would end up being blocked before reaching the instance."
36432,Amazon EC2 V1,"Yes, I did check for that. How do I check where my request stops?"
36432,Amazon EC2 V1,That makes it reasonable to assume that the request reaches your instance. Which AMI are you using? It would be interesting to know if you get a timeout. What happens when you visit http://<ElasticIP>?

I am going to put the details below along with my questions.  Any information you can provide me would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks  I plan on hosting customer imaged in AWS S3 and the customers and family can log in and view all of the pictures taken so as to place an order.  The customer can also create digital albums with their own photos that they can access, print and share with others.  The numbers are a realistic estimate of the site at a decent workload once it is established.  I plan on hosting about 2,000,000 images with a total storage space in AWS S3 of about 1TB.  I plan on using 2 large reserved (heavy utilization) instances with 24 hour usage each.   I understand the above server and storage prices but I don't understand the bandwitdh (data charges) and queries.  It would be a great help if someone could explain this to me.  If I have 400 people accessing 100 files a day that are 550KB what would that cost me?  If I have 1000 people accessing 10000 files a day?  Is there a good way to set this up so I am not being charged a for a ton of bandwidth?  would it make a difference if the images were stored on the server and an EBS?

36423,Amazon EC2 V1,"why are high usage reserved instances cheaper than light usage? I just worked out the math for extended monthly cost of a micro instance.  Looks like it would actually be CHEAPER to get a heavy usage reserved instance.  There's a higher up-front cost, but even factoring that in it winds up being cheaper monthly.  Why is that?  It doesn't make sense to me."
36423,Amazon EC2 V1,"The reservation type is not tied to some kind of allowed utilization in any way, and it has no effect on the instance specifications either. It is simply a billing feature. You can have an instance running 100% of the time for 3 years with a Light reservation.  If you intend to have an instance up and running for the entire term, a Heavy reservation is definitely the best choice. You can certainly go with a Light reservation, but the total savings would be lower if you use the instance for the whole 1 or 3 years.  However, if you purchase a Heavy reservation, note that you will be charged for every hour, no matter if there is an instance running or not. With a Light or Medium reservation, you can terminate the instance at any time to avoid further hourly charges."
36423,Amazon EC2 V1,"Thanks for the reply!  Maybe I'm just missing how the billing/service works.  My current host has had several outages recently, so I'm looking to switch somewhere else.  Someone suggested I look into AWS for hosting my personal website.  Looking at the pricing matrix for a EC2 ""micro"" instance, I find the following:  (see http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/ )  On-Demand: $0.02/hour Light Reserved (1-yr or 3-yr): $23 or $35 up front plus $0.012/hour Medium Reserved (1-yr or 3-yr): $54 or $82 up front plus $0.007/hour Heavy Reserved (1-yr or 3-yr): $62 or $100 up front plus $0.005/hour  Assuming I want this server available 24/7, I would want it for 24*30 = 720 hours/mo.  Factoring in the up-front costs amortized over the 1- or 3-year periods, they come to the following per-month cost:  On-Demand: $14.40 per mo Light Reserved (1-yr or 3-yr): $10.61 or $9.61 per month Medium Reserved (1-yr or 3-yr): $9.54 or $7.31 per month Heavy Reserved (1-yr or 3-yr): $8.76 or $6.37 per month  So:  (1) What is the difference between getting a ""light reserved"" instance and getting a ""heavy reserved"" instance?  (2) Why are the ""heavy"" ones LESS expensive over time?  I'm assuming ""heavy"" is somehow ""better""?  Again, thanks for your time!  Edited by: Timothy L Skoch on Mar 24, 2012 12:39 PM"
36423,Amazon EC2 V1,"Heavy medium and light are references to how much the instances is on and not how much load is on the instance.  Since ec2 is elastic, you can start up additional instances as you need them, and terminate them when you don't. But even with that, you may have instances that are going to be on 24/7. The reservations levels provide more flexiblity to different types of customers."
36423,Amazon EC2 V1,"Timothy L Skoch wrote: (1) What is the difference between getting a ""light reserved"" instance and getting a ""heavy reserved"" instance?  The difference is that you won't be able to save as much. Assuming you use the instance for the entire term, Medium or Heavy is your best bet. Again, it has nothing to do with one being better than the other. Your instance is not affected in any way.  Go to http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/reserved-instances/#2 and scroll down to the table. If you take a look at the annual utilization, you will see that Heavy provides optimal savings. However, if the instance is running for say 20% of the time, Light is better. You probably get the idea. Keep in mind that ""utilization"" translates to ""wall clock time"". An instance running for an entire year equals 100%.  (2) Why are the ""heavy"" ones LESS expensive over time?  I'm assuming ""heavy"" is somehow ""better""?  Because you are basically telling AWS you will be using this instance for the entire term. Even if you don't, you will end up paying for it all. When purchasing a Heavy reservation, you get the lowest possible price in exchange for this commitment. They can charge you for the full usage during 1 or 3 years, which means they are able to give you a really good offer.  Heavy is not ""better"" in terms of performance or anything like that. You get the exact same product - the EC2 instance of your choice - no matter which reservation you purchase."
36423,Amazon EC2 V1,"Thanks for your explanation.  So the only difference is how the money works out on YOUR end, nothing changes on Amazon's end except how much they charge you up front and per-hour.  I'm marking the question as answered, but I have one additional one:  Then is a micro instance suitable for a simple personal website?  All I do is run a couple of cron jobs, a few (personal) web services, and tinker with PHP/mySQL sometimes.  Would a single micro instance be suitable for this?  If so, looks like I should sign up for a heavy (since I want it always-on?) utilization reserved instance?  Thanks again for your help!  Edited by: Timothy L Skoch on Mar 24, 2012 6:13 PM"

36419,Amazon EC2 V1,"Instance ""disappearing"" periodically from monitoring - cant connect Hi  We have had this issue before, on a different instance completely unrelated to this one. For the last few months I haven't seen it, and assumed that the problem was fixed on the Amazon side. Now it appears that the problem is back and is affecting a new m2.4xlarge instance I just created.  Essentially the server just ""disappears"", I really don't know how else to describe it. No CPU or Network activity, just a big ""white space"" in the monitoring graphs. And during the period no one can connect to it. Then it just ""returns"" on its own.  I've attached a image of the CPU activity graph, please note that this happened within a few minutes of bringing the instance online which is why the graph only starts at 16:07. The arrows I've drawn illustrate the ""gap"" period.  Previously (with another instance, but same problem) one of the Amazon techs kindly moved us to different hardware, it seemed to resolve it for a while but then it returned a few times. Then in December it stopped doing this altogether, and I haven't seen it happen until I launched this instance today.  If anyone can shed any light on this problem I would be most grateful, this is a production server hosting an API with 700 clients so our help desk gets flooded whenever this occurs!  Thanks  Bill"

36413,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi cgws00,  The hours of utilization you are seeing are related the Heavy Utilization Reserved Instance that was purchased on March 18th.  Heavy Utilization reservations are designed for steady-state workloads where youâre willing to commit to always running these instances in exchange for our lowest hourly usage fee. With this RI, you pay a little higher upfront payment than Medium Utilization RIs, a significantly lower hourly usage fee, and youâre charged that lower hourly rate for every hour in the Reserved Instance term you purchase.  For each month of the 1 year term for the RI you will see an entry on the account activity page automatically charging your for the number of hours in the month.  Since the RI was just purchased this month the usage is prorated for the time remaining in the month at the time the purchase was completed.  I hope this helps.

I read on the spec sheet that I should be able to get several hundred gigs or even over a TB of storage for the large or x-large instances, but...in the wizard all of the ones available are only 35GB in hard disk size.  That is barely enough for Windows Server R2 much less anything else.   Am I looking in the wrong place for instances?  Thanks!"
36409,Amazon EC2 V1,"Basically, the AMI that you launch determines the root volume size; your are right, 35gb is enough for Windows, with a little breathing room for registry growth, etc.  You will likely want to allocate an EBS volume of your desired size, say 500gb.  You then ""associate"" that EBS volume to your instance as a device, say ""xvdf"".  From Windows itself then, simply use Windows Disk Management to enable that new raw device, and specify a partition, a drive letter or mount point, and format it.  You can easily attach, say, two 500gb volumes, associate them as ""xvdf"" and ""xvdg"", and then use Windows Disk Management to create a mirrored or stripped volume, and format it for use.  (We actually use mirrored partitions for our SQL Server databases, though they are only 100gb.)  You can create EBS volumes and associate them to your instances using the AWS Management Console, or the API, or the command-line tools.  (I use the AWS Management Console.)  James  P.S. If you simply want that initial root partition to be larger, search the forums as there are plenty of walkthroughs on how to do that.  (We prefer to keep our Windows root distinct from our data...)"
36409,Amazon EC2 V1,"In order for the OP take advantage of the extra instance  storage space in the larger images, the image must be launched from the command line which gives the option of specifying the extra space.

I know with normal EBS-backed instances, if you manually terminate the instance the root volume is automatically cleaned up.

36396,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hmm... yeah that's not my intent at all. So now I'm a bit confused. AWS recommends that when using spot instances you design around making sure your data is captured regularly. One way they recommend doing that is with EBS.   If the EBS root volume is lost, then what's the point of using an EBS-backed spot instance? Did they mean using additional EBS volumes that get attached to the instance?  Thanks!"
36396,Amazon EC2 V1,Where do they recommend capturing data with EBS?
36396,Amazon EC2 V1,"http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot-instances/  ""Save Your Work Frequently: Because Spot Instances can be terminated without warning, it is important to build your applications in a way that allows you to make progress even if your application is interrupted. There are many ways to accomplish this, two of which include adding checkpoints to your application and splitting your work into small increments. Using Amazon EBS volumes to store your data is one easy way to protect your data."""
36396,Amazon EC2 V1,"When they ""save your data"" they must mean something other than the traditional meaning of saving data (save it remotely?) because with spot instances your data will not persist whether you save it or not. Maybe an amazonian can weigh in on what that paragraph is supposed to mean."
36396,Amazon EC2 V1,"Yeah, I agree it's a bit confusing. Have you actually seen a spot instance get killed and your EBS volume go away? I always bid way above the on-demand price so I've never had an instance get killed. But I'd like to know before my data is lost"
36396,Amazon EC2 V1,"Yes, the volume always gets deleted. Not only that but you cannot enable ""termination protection"" for a spot instance. Basically Amazon is trying to artificially add value to an on-demand or reserved instance by making it seem like that your data is in jepoardy on a spot instance. But really it should just encourage you to snapshot and provide failover.  Anyway, we all learned recently that you can't really count on your data persisting  even with on-demand or reserved instances so go ahead and save yourself a few bucks with the spot instances. But snapshot and plan for failure."
36396,Amazon EC2 V1,"I wanted to clarify the behavior of how Spot Instances work with EBS volumes. Specifically, if your Spot Instance is reclaimed, your Amazon EBS volume will be deleted if it was mounted as your root partition. If you mounted an Amazon EBS volume separately (e.g. not part of the launch process), your volume will not be deleted when a Spot Instance is reclaimed.  Additionally, I wanted to clarify that when a Spot Instance is reclaimed because the market price goes above your max bid price, your instance will be terminated. I am bringing this up because baloney 's comment earlier was incorrect: ""The unexpected thing about spot instances (to me anyway) is that if a spot instance request expires, the instance that was spawned from it does not terminate, rather you're left paying the on-demand price""  At any rate, I hope these clarifications are helpful. Thanks, Dave"
36396,Amazon EC2 V1,"Thanks Dave, that was helpful. I was wondering what would happen to an an attached non-root EBS volume when the spot instance terminates and now I know. I hope Amazon doesn't decide to change this because it sounds like a loophole to get persistent data for spot instances. It makes me wonder what the incentive is to reserve an instance or pay on-demand.  For the record my statement was not incorrect, when your spot request expires (not goes below market price) the instance created from it hangs around and you are left holding the bag for the on-demand price."
36396,Amazon EC2 V1,"That's an important safety tip, thank you!  I haven't used the expiration feature on spot requests yet but when I do I will definitely need to put in a Blade Runner gene so the instances don't outlive the request."
36396,Amazon EC2 V1,"baloney wrote: .. when your spot request expires (not goes below market price) the instance created from it hangs around and you are left holding the bag for the on-demand price.  Is this documented anywhere? I have to admit I've not been using spot instances that often, but I don't see this behavior."
36396,Amazon EC2 V1,"Same here. My understanding was that the ""spot request"" handled the launching of the spot instance, after it has launched the spot request means nothing.  I'm not certain though, so would be good to get some AWS official clarification."
36396,Amazon EC2 V1,"It's not documented anywhere but it was verified in a different thread to be the correct (though not desirable) behavior by an Amazon employee. It's hard to imagine anyone wanting their spot request to end but to continue paying the higher price for the instance.  My question for you is why don't you use spot instances very often? After Dave's clarification about volumes persisting after being attached to terminated spot instances, I can't think of a good reason to pay the higher price."
36396,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi bc9am, Once a spot instance has launched, usage is charged at the spot price, and only the spot price. The spot price may rise up to, and even above, the on-demand usage price, but the instance will never be ""converted"" into an on-demand instance. The instance stays running until you terminate it, or the spot price rises to the maximum price in the bid responsible for launching the instance, at which point it will be terminated.  I hope this clarifies things. Regards, --Brian."
36396,Amazon EC2 V1,"Well I'm not going to argue about it anymore but yeah, there still is some confusion. How about adding an option for 'terminate instance when request expires'?"
36396,Amazon EC2 V1,"I think the key thing is to understand that, for now, spot requests/bids only affect the launching of instances. Once launched, they have no control over termination with one exception: the actual bid price. What you're asking for seems reasonable, but just not something they do today."
36396,Amazon EC2 V1,"This is an old thread, but I need one quick clarification. Will a volume that is attached as part of the boot process (using the -b parameter), but not as the root volume also be deleted?"

36395,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hello,  You can only have 2 x.509 certificates at any given time. If you don't see the option to create a new certificate, you'll need to delete one of the existing ones first. Be sure that you do not delete one that is currently in use at your company.  Once you've deleted the extra one, you should then see the option to create a new one.  I hope this helps."
36395,Amazon EC2 V1,Thanks! That helps.  I hope amazon will put some effort to integrate better help messages in the UI because documentation is out of since and details like this one are missing.
36395,Amazon EC2 V1,Could I second the note for this UI to be improved. I spent quite a while hunting round for information on why the create certificate control was not visible. A note added to the UI explaining that you must any certificates in excess of one before creating a fresh one would be very helpful.
36395,Amazon EC2 V1,I would also like to see this documented on the Access Credentials/X.509 Certificates tab. It was very confusing that I couldn't find a way to create a new certificate until I found this thread.
36395,Amazon EC2 V1,"Hi,  The following documentation describes the where/how/how many of x.509 certificates for your account: http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-credentials.html#using-credentials-certificate  Does this help?  Regards, Zach"
36395,Amazon EC2 V1,"Yes, it's mentioned there, although it should probably set apart as a Note to draw attention to it. But my suggestion is having a similar note where X.509 Certificates are created. I had created two a while ago and was looking to make a third -- but since it had been a while, it wasn't obvious that I had reached the limit and went looking around for the place to add new ones. A simple note, right where the ""Create a new Certificate | Upload Your Own Certificate"" are when you have less than two certificates, would save a lot of confusion for those who don't remember the limit of two."
36395,Amazon EC2 V1,"I have an impression that AWS product/UI developers don't really care about their users, I wasted so much time trying to figure out these stupid UI tricks ""oh, if you don't see an option to create a new certificate and you have two existing certificates you need to deactivate and then delete one of them in order to be able to create a new certificate, and the best way to figure this out is to google it and hope that other people already wasted their time on this stupid UI trick""  Thank you Amazon for great user experience."

We had sent a notice to the e-mail address associated with your AWS account regarding this issue on 12/26/2011 and advised that you launch a replacement instance. Please see a copy of the e-mail text below.  This instance is an instance-store instance. In order to relocate it to a different underlying host, you will need to launch a replacement instance. You may want to consider changing to an EBS-backed instance at some point in the future. One of the advantages of using EBS-backed is that you can issue a stop and then a start on the instance to relocate it to a different underlying host.  Regards, Mary  ===Notification e-mail===  Hello,  We have noticed that one or more of your instances is running on a host degraded due to hardware failure. The host needs to undergo maintenance and will be taken down after 12:00 GMT on 2011-12-26. If you do not take action before this time they will be terminated at this point.  i-91fd5dfb  The risk of your instances failing is increased at this point. We cannot determine the health of any applications running on the instances. We recommend that you take appropriate action.  If your instance was launched from an EBS-backed AMI, issuing a stop and start from the AWS Management Console will migrate your instance to new hardware and help avoid any unforeseen downtime.  For more options to stop and start your instance please see: http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/starting-stopping-instances.html  If your instance was launched from an instance store-backed AMI, you should launch a replacement instance from your most recent AMI and migrate all necessary data to the replacement instance.

But when I create an image of this via ec2-create-image and run the resulting image the /etc/fstab is overwritten, replaced by the default fstab. At first the drives seem to mount at my specified location, but without the options I had used in the fstab. Strangely, one of the drives is mounted twice (also at /mnt, its original location).   How can I use the custom /etc/fstab in my custom image?

36392,Amazon EC2 V1,"OK, I seem to have worked around the problem.  I discovered that the overwriting of my /etc/fstab was caused by Ubuntu's CloudInit system in early initialization of the machine.  CloudInit can be configured via CloudConfig, but I couldn't actually find a way to change the ephemeral mount points. I ended up hacking into the CloudConfig file at /path/to/cloudinit/CloudConfig/cc_mounts.py and commenting out the ephemeral mount point like so # these are our default set of mounts defmnts = [ #[ ""ephemeral0"", ""/mnt"", ""auto"", defvals[3], ""0"", ""2"" ],             [ ""swap"", ""none"", ""swap"", ""sw"", ""0"", ""0"" ] ]  I also removed the comment=cloudconfig options from my /etc/fstab.
