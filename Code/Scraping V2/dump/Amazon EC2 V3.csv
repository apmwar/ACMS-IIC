The active instance immediately became unavailable publicly to remote desktop or web traffic, but since I hadn't done this before I thought maybe that was normal although pretty crappy if that is the normal case and it wasn't mentioned anywhere. As of today I still didn't have a new image, but it did create a snapshot, so I tried to do it again today again it tole me a process was in process on the instance so it failed. I deleted the snapshot and tried again with the same results. I also still couldn't remote desktop to it so I stop the instance and tried create again with the same results. I also don't have the option to ""bundle it"" or ""launch more like this"". So I figured I need some help to figure out what is wrong.Please help.

17484,Amazon EC2 V3,We are looking into this now.  We've re-tested multi-domain certs and they upload as expected.  As we get more information we'll post it here.
17484,Amazon EC2 V3,We are still having this issue. With larger multidomain UC certificates we receive 'privateKey' failed to satisfy constraint: Member must have length less than or equal to 16384.

17483,Amazon EC2 V3,"Some thoughts on Amazon's support (on instance rebooting yesterday) Yesterday (10/26/2010) morning we found our website was suddenly unreachable. We were panicked as this would affect thousands of our users. So we decided to contact Amazon - but apparently we need to purchase the premium support to get a quick answer. So we paid and it turned out our instance was rebooted by Amazon due to a ""service event"". We fixed the issue (mount ebs). Amazon's support was prompt and explained well. But we can't help wondering:1. Shouldn't we get notified before such a ""service event"" happened? If it is not planned, should we get notified when it happened? Rebooting is a major event and will disrupt a lot of services. We are very surprised that we don't get any notification on this event. 2. In such an emergent event, as Amazon doesn't notify us, shouldn't there be a free channel for us to reach Amazon support quickly?"
17483,Amazon EC2 V3,"Good of you to bring this up. We are of the same opinion as well. Our instances have been thrown off balance and I have been using this medium for putting it across and I am not getting any timely support so far. Clearly, the ""forum"" model of support doesn't work and clearly Amazon's setup is not fool proof enough that we would never need to contact them.   The idea of paying $400 just to resolve issues that might originate at Amazon end seems too high. My business head is already giving me the go ahead for evaluating alternatives - specially because of the support model at Amazon.   If Amazon truly thinks that they are production ready, then we shouldn't see so many issues originating at Amazon end. If they think that we don't need to give support - and the service is on a ""as-is"" basis, then clearly, it doesn't work when we are running production quality applications."
17483,Amazon EC2 V3,"The 3 levels of support seem fair altough it would be good if the forums were more proactively managed by Amazon, quite often you won't get a reply.If it keeps the costs down then I think forums-only support is good. If you need additional support you have to pay for it.However, the main issue is if Amazon reboots your instance there needs to be a better way of letting the instance owners know. If the underlying hardware has an issue again an alert of some sort would be great.I know we have to design for failure in the ""cloud"" but an amazon instigated instance failure should be handled better, an alert of some sort would be great.Thanks"
17483,Amazon EC2 V3,"We have been using AWS successfully for a couple years now and we have found that you really have to do your own monitoring and set up your own failover architectures.  They provide the datacenter capacity and diversity and it's up to us to build on that.  For example, we have monitoring set up (from outside of EC2) and scripts that automate failover so that we can lose a server or have one get rebooted and no one even notices.Sometimes they do send out emails when they see that a host is failing so that you can spin up a new instance on a different host.Seems that they don't want people to rely too much on one host -- no single points of failure.But, yeah, more communication and support would be nice.-- Don"
17483,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi,My name is Brent Jaye and I recently joined Amazon Web Services to lead our Support team.  Thank you for the feedback, we recognize that reboots are impactful and as with all issues that can cause customer impact we work hard to prevent or avoid them whenever possible.   While some reboots are planned, these are relatively rare, the unplanned reboots we sometimes experience are the result of hardware issues. In cases where the reboot is planned or a foreseeable possible consequence of maintenance, maintenance notifications are sent.  Improving customer notifications around planned reboot events is a feature request that we're planning to address. Specifically, we're looking at ways to improve contact information management and notification routing, and provide more control over what events trigger communication from us. If you have any additional specific feedback as to how you'd like this mechanism to work, we'd love to hear it.Our approach in support is to keep our offering un-bundled so that individual developers have the power to put together a comprehensive solution, preferably with premium support, that makes sense for their specific needs.  We recognize that AWS is removing the money barrier to accessing substantial technical capabilities for individual and small sized customers.  We also recognize that for these small customers, the price of accessing high end engineering talent to troubleshoot technical issues may be prohibitive.  We are working on programs to strengthen our free support channels for these customers in addition to improvements with our paid channels. We review forum posts, issues reported via the Service Health Dashboard, and we take responsibility for AWS owned problems.  When we've looked at the diagnosis of escalations from our customers, many problems that we observe end up originating from within the customer environment.  Changes to internal operating systems, firewalls, application configurations, or other elements owned by the customer can generate symptoms that look like a service failure.  These escalations are difficult to troubleshoot, but Premium Support engineers can help to rule out issues external to the configuration of an instance.  The support team can also, when needed, provide advice on how to more effectively use different AWS features to help a customer make their environment more fault-tolerant.  Customers that do not select a paid support offering will continue to have access to our self service tools and our vibrant user community for these problems.

17477,Amazon EC2 V3,"Disk access causes high iowait and blocking Background: Today we have been setting up a few new EC2 instances, one of which is an extra large instance with the root volume on the instance store, plus a small EBS volume.  On this instance I have started a process with performs some semi CPU- and I/O-intensive text indexing which writes to files on the instance store volume and reads from the EBS volume (via Postgres).  The problem: At regular intervals, disk access will block for several minutes (2-3 minutes). During such an interval, iowait will rise from 0% up to 14-20%, while the ""average queue length"" on the instance store volume will rise to several hundred.  During this time, other processes doing disk access will block randomly, and SSH will *consistently* block while receiving logins. In other words, it's not possible to log in using SSH while this is going on. In fact, the instance pretty much stalls for the entire interval.

17476,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi armkb,Without an instance id it's difficult to tell you exactly what's going on here, but there are a couple of things that you should investigate:- Make sure that your security group rules permit the traffic that you are attempting to pass.  You will probably want tcp/80 and tcp/443 traffic permitted from anywhere if you are running a website.  If you want to ping the instance from the outside, you willl need to add a rule allowing ICMP traffic into your security group as well.- If you are running a Windows 2008 instance, you should be aware that Windows 2008 as deployed on EC2 denies ICMP traffic by default, using the local firewall configuration.  You can update this in the Windows firewall settings.Hope this helps!-Jason"
17476,Amazon EC2 V3,Thank you very much - I was able to access - now I need to figure out why https isn't working.
17475,Amazon EC2 V3,"How do I tell a request came from HTTPS on the ELB? One of the security features I do is to automatically re-direct my users to HTTPS if they come in through HTTP and hit a secure URL, such as when they go to log in. With Apache running my SSL cert, I was able to handle this by simply adding a RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off rule, but that obviously doesn't work with ELB proxying the SSL termination.  I figured there must be some other way to tell that it's an HTTPS connection on the client end, but I can't find that anywhere. None of the headers seem to indicate that the client is indeed connected to the load balancer via HTTPS. Am I missing something or is this feature not implemented?"
17475,Amazon EC2 V3,"Just do a rewrite rule.Anyone hitting your port 80 vhost redirect to https://.This should work:<pre class=""apache"" style=""font-family: monospace""><span style=""color: #00007f"">RewriteEngine</span> <span style=""color: #0000ff"">On</span><span style=""color: #00007f"">RewriteCond</span> %{HTTPS} <span style=""color: #0000ff"">off</span><span style=""color: #00007f"">RewriteRule</span> (.*) https://%\{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI}</pre>"
17475,Amazon EC2 V3,"No, that doesn't work, because they're always hitting port 80, even when they're on 443 on the ELB, since 443 on the ELB is simply re-directing to port 80 and adding SSL.  The only way I can find to do this is by inserting something client-side, such as JavaScript, but that obviously doesn't work as a general rule since not all of my clients are browsers..."
17475,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hm, I'd like to know the answer to this as well.  It's important for our application to keep people on the right protocol.  In fact, we'd like an answer that cannot be spoofed by the user.  I.e., if the answer is an HTTP header set by the proxy, then the user should not be able to pass in their own value for it.  Is it possible to have the ELB port 443 send requests to a different port on the back end?"
17475,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi,This is what I did:On my apache server I configured second vhost listening on port 81 and configured ELB to forward HTTPS to port 81.So any HTTP request would go to port 80 and HTTPS request would be sent to port 81.It would be nice if ELB created a header (X-FORWARDED-PROTO, for example) and inserted the original protocol into it... Pretty please, Amazon"
17475,Amazon EC2 V3,"It sounds like using a separate port will *almost* work for us.  However, the ELB documentation states:  <blockquote> <i>To ensure that Elastic Load Balancing can communicate with the EC2 instances in the LoadBalancer, make sure you enable network ingress on your EC2 security group for the 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range</i> </blockquote>  This seems like it means that any user on the Internet could bypass the ELB and connect directly to our port which we identify for SSL use and they won't be using SSL.

Can someone guide me to a tutorial or write a small text on how i could achieve this situation:- i would like to start a new instance (whether it is EBS-Root or Instance-Storage depends on what would be necessary/easier to use) with windows (2003 or 2008 doesn´t really matter)- on this instance i would like to install and configure a few programs with a total storage-space need of around 8GB- after doing so, i would like to create a boot-image (AMI, right?) to start several more instance, that would be setup and configured from thebeginning on like the other one was, that i set up right before.- all instances would need to be able to get access to the working data.The ideal way would be, that there is one instance in the cloud, that is holding the data and managing the working process of all the others. All worker-instances would access the data from the manager-instance. Isthat possible? Would you suggest to do/avoid that?If that wouldn´t be a good idea...then every worker node would also needenough storage to hold the working data of around 5-10 GB.I don´t think that is a completely unusual situation. But i´m really having problems figuring out, how to set all that up and also important:how to calculate the costs of that. I mean...i would need to count in the instance-fee, maybe the EBS-fees and the transfer-fees. I don´t really know if i forgot something.2.)As soon as i boot an instance from an EBS-Volume (windows server 2008 Amazon AMI), this instance only has the EBS-Capacity as storage.Shouldn´t there be more storage....the volatile instance-storage, that gets erased, when the instance is stopped?If not...do i really have to pay to get a somewhat descent amount of capacity for working-data (which is not sensitive...so no problem with being erased as soon as the instance stops)I mean...if i buy a normal instance with only volatile instance-storage, then i get around 500GB for some of the instances for free. Is there any way to access that from an EBS-root-Instance?I´m trying to render a few images on EC2 and would need that disk-space for textures, project-files and all that stuff a 3d-scene needs to be rendered out. All the finished images would then be written to another location away from that instance...3.)Why do normal Instances have only such a small root-volume? It´s only around 10GB for the amazon-windows-2003-image. Is there a way to set that to something bigger so that i can install a couple of programs additional to windows?Thanks for your helpMessage was edited by: tommle  Message was edited by: tommle"

17459,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hmm. Well I guess you're talking about the extra ""0"" you're seeing in the headers? I haven't seen that before. Does that happen if you pull directly from the ELB using curl?

And are you intending to serve all requests from there, or just trying to catch people do type in ""mydomain.com"" instead of ""www.mydomain.com""? If you're just trying to cover that case and don't need to serve requests directly from mydomain.com then a simple HTTP redirect would probably be easier and less error prone as well cheaper and take advantage of the ELB scalability."

17453,Amazon EC2 V3,"Persisitance Storage Question I am having trouble understanding one aspect of persistent storage.I followed the instructions for changing the root volume to not delete on termination. Therefore, when an EBS backed instance terminates, the root volume is not deleted. However, what if you want to re-launch the instance using that same volume? If I look at the properties of the EBS AMI, the block device points to a snapshot, which is the original snapshot. Can I change the AMI properties to point to a new snapshot that I created? How to I re-use the volume that was not deleted in a new instance?"
17453,Amazon EC2 V3,"you create a snapshot from the volume, then a new AMI that points to that snapshot.  as far as i know there's no automated way to skip these steps and go straight to a new instance with a specific volume as the boot disk."

17448,Amazon EC2 V3,"You can create a replacement ELB (with a single letter name), and a replacement AutoScaling group. Here's what you'd need to do:  1) Create a replacement ELB ""e"". 2) Create a replacement AutoScaling Group ""a"" with the trigger defined appropriately. 3) Change the domain's CNAME to point to e's DNS name. 4) Wait a while, about 24 hours. You're waiting until your old AS Group has reached its minimum size and your old ELB no longer shows any requests (via its CloudWatch metrics). Also see the note below. 5) Remove any remaining instances from the old ELB and terminate them. Delete the old AutoScaling Group and ELB.  Note: It's possible that, depending on how your AutoScaling trigger is defined, the period during Step 4 will see strange scaling behavior. This will not be a problem if your trigger uses metrics in the ELB domain, but it can happen if your trigger uses metrics in the EC2 domain. If your two AS Groups' triggers both consider the same metrics twice then the triggers will not function properly during this period."

17432,Amazon EC2 V3,"micro-instances steal cycles issues since the last 24 hours Hi,  We have a bunch of t1 micro instances running. 2 of them have started seeing very high CPU steal cycle percentage, as measured by the Munin plugin, since the last 24-28 hours. Before that, all was working fine. In correlation to this, our apps hosted on those instances have become very very slow (the HTTP load times have gone up from about 100ms to an average of 3500ms with the max going up to 7000ms). Thankfully enough, these were our internal test servers, but we would like to know why this is happening and solve it before the problem spreads to our live servers.  I could potentially try forking new instances and kill the old ones, but it is a time consuming process (we don't run enough servers to justify automating it or creating our own AMIs) and I have no idea if it would actually solve the problem and hence would like to avoid doing it.  Anybody has any idea on why this would happen? And why so suddenly? How to fix this? How to avoid this?  Regards, Shreeni"
17432,Amazon EC2 V3,This could just be the expected low long-term CPU throughput design of a micro instance. They are intended for very low or bursty workloads. You could try stopping the instance and changing its type to m1.small and starting it again to see if that fixes it. If so it probably means you're exceeding the ability of a t.micro instance to run your application under whatever load you've got.
17432,Amazon EC2 V3,"I don't think that is the case. Our Munin graphs show that we have been at very low CPU usage states - and pretty much the same for every other metric. There is no metric which is even remotely close to even half-saturation. In general, we were using only about 1-5% of the power of that instance.  This is what happened, if my reading is right - we were running an instance with low usage - Amazon's virtualization decide to start stealing and it totally throttled the machine - even when we genuinely wanted cycles for serving pages. And of course, I am still unable to retrieve the nodes as detailed in Posts #2 & #7 of http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/thread.jspa?threadID=53608&tstart=60  Also, is t1.micro only meant to be used for a few hours/days? Can't we build a deployment strategy around the use of many t1.micro nodes rather than a few m1.small nodes?"
17431,Amazon EC2 V3,"Prevent terminate flag Just made a stupid mistake and on terminating a few slave webservers, the master got checked and terminated.  Luckily the code, etc. was stored in git and I had an image but the damage was still done.Anyway, I heard there is an ec2 flag that can prevent certain machines from being terminated.  I have and use the ami-tools, but don't see anything like it, even under the references http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/CommandLineReference/ I don't see it.  Maybe it's stress, or just a long day, but if such a flag exists, can someone point me there?  Also, what happens if you say make an image and that flag is on (as it does have to reboot)?  Im sure the docs will note that, but any help is appreciated."

17427,Amazon EC2 V3,"At present, we do not support creating and uploading your own windows AMI. You will have to start with one of the public windows AMI."
17427,Amazon EC2 V3,What would be required for us to upload our own Windows AMIs then? I've build up some Windows images in Xen and am installing the EC2ConfigSetup.msi  I've figured that I'm missing the ability to set the AMI to be Windows once I upload it. I'm guessing this is in part missing the <virtualization_method>HVM</virtualization_method> in the <machine_configuration> section of the manifest.  My situation is that we are partnered with Microsoft and want to run software on servers and clients in EC2 that only talk to each other. We would be providing our own licenses and not providing the AMIs as products thus the whole productCode section of the manifest is not relevant/applicable.  I'm confident that I can get the machine setup file to run... it's just the configuration of the AMI that I'm missing the ability to manipulate.
17427,Amazon EC2 V3,"Due to licensing issues, we cannot allow you to upload your own windows AMI.>>I've figured that I'm missing the ability to set the AMI to be Windows once I upload >>it.>>I'm guessing this is in part missing the>><virtualization_method>HVM</virtualization_method> in the>><machine_configuration> section of the manifest.This is by design to prevent users from uploading their own AMI.

17427,Amazon EC2 V3,"Due to licensing issues, we cannot allow you to upload your own windows AMI.    Well I'm working here at Microsoft in Sydney, Australia and they say that there aren't any licensing issues if we A) have our own licenses to cover the instances that we run, B) use it for our own use and not on sell it (provide copies to third parties). Which is exactly what we want to do. I can provide proof of this if required/requested. So that's the licensing issues out of the way.  In fact our number 1 customer will be Microsoft. to provide services to their Solutions Development Center here in Sydney.  I figure that the increased cost if the Windows AMIs +2.5c/h is to cover the license costs to Microsoft which I think is a pretty good rate.  The other alternative for us would be for Amazon to provide some base Windows client machines that we users could build up as we need.  I.e. Windows XP+SP2 only (SP1 would be nice but I see that the RedHat XenPV driver software is for SP2 and greater) and Vista, ...  Then we could take these and create all our required permutations... XP+SP3 , XP+SP3+IE7, Vista+SP1, etc...  Thanks, Bernard   Message was edited by: bernarddavison"
17427,Amazon EC2 V3,"Bernard,We understand your desire to bring your own license.  Remember, though, that Amazon EC2 is not a traditional hosting environment with dedicated machines associated with every customer.  Instead, we virtualize our servers.  While Microsoft recently published a virtualization brief removing certain licensing restrictions in a virtualized environment, these restrictions were not eliminated for Windows Server.  Therefore, at this time, we are not able to allow customers to bring their own Windows Server licenses.  However, we are continuing to work with Microsoft to try to improve licensing flexibility in our cloud.  I will also take your other requests (Windows Vista/XP) under advisement as we plan future additions to the product roadmap.Thanks,Dave"
17427,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi Dave,  Excellent news.  We are happy to use the Windows server images that you are providing though like others have said previously they would be of most use to us if they (or an image for each OS version) were built at the absolute minimum level of supported software.  This way we could build up the images that we needed with the patches we needed and nothing else...  Having the RedHat XenPV and Ec2ConfigSetup software installed is fine and the latte I see required .Net framework 2.0. But as for other software (including patches) if that could be excluded it would be prefect for us.  I have a Windows XP + SP2 with .Net framework and Ec2ConfigSetup installed and ready to go if that would help get things moving faster. All it needs is the RedHad XenPV software installed and it would I imagine be ready to roll... ???  One of the things that the Microsoft licensing guy said to us was that if you have licenses for Vista then you can run any previous version of the OS under that license. (Note license is different to product key)  Cheers, Bernard."

Take a look at http://elwoodicious.com/2009/12/23/using-elb-to-serve-multiple-domains-over-ssl-on-ec2-for-giggles/You can request more ELB's as long as you can justify it. Amazon gave us no problem when we needed more. Amazon did recently announce ELB support for SSL, but as far as I know you can only have one cert per ELB so you would still need multiple ELB's."

I (ok my employers) have a serious need for cloud computing. Trouble is all our customers require us to sign an agreement that their data will never [intentionally] leave England due to the Data Protection Act (and probably other Acts). This is not something we do anything about.  Ireland is close, just not close enough. How about London or Manchester..? Anyone else out there have a similar need?"

I then have a 150GB drive, which is un-used. I understand this to be my instance storage. Last, we have another 10GB drive for data. I believe that the C has been pushed into this 10GB space because of the fact that this is a saved image.

17399,Amazon EC2 V3,Thanks for trying Amazon Linux AMI.  It does look like that we were missing that configure flag.  We will get this in the queue to be rebuilt with the --enable-unicode-properties flag and will release it into the repo in the near future.
17399,Amazon EC2 V3,Good deal. I'd much rather just get it working up front without weird customizations. Thanks for your quick reply.

17398,Amazon EC2 V3,"Problem when Elastic IP not mapped to the instance but mapped at DNS Hello,I have an Elastic IP say x.x.x.x  and I have not mapped it to any instance.We are developing a web application so I have a got a domain name registerd ( say www.xyz.com) and there I have mapped domin name with this Elastic IP i.e x.x.x.x Now what I want is some user access the URL www.xyz.com , A static ""Page under construction"" message is shown to him.The current behaviour is ,browser shows the page server not found.is there any other way so that I can show user the page underconstruction message other then creating an instance and mapping it to the Elactic IP and then putting the message in it"
17398,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi thereIf I'm understanding you correctly, you have an EIP reserved but you have not associated it to an instance. If you wish to see a ""Page under construction"" holding page, you are going to need to run an instance which is serving the page. For this you will need a Webserver such as Apache or IIS. You will need to associate the EIP with the instance and then all requests that go to www.xyz.com will resolve to this instance.I hope that is clear and that I have correctly understood your question. Please also note that if you have an EIP that is not associated with an instance, you are charged a nominal fee whereas if you associate with an instance, you are not charged: http://aws.amazon.com/articles/1346 Many thanks!"
17398,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi There,yes you have understood my question correctly.So the only solution to show the 'page under construction'  message is to have an instance associated with EIP.I thought there might be a way to show the message without having the need to create and instancemany thanks."

17396,Amazon EC2 V3,"How to expand the boot EBS volume of an EC2 instance? Here is our situation:  We currently have a EC2 instance connected to a 30GB EBS volume, which acts as the system/primary partition. However, as the site expanded we found that the storage is no longer enough for our needs. Due to the nature of our web application it cannot be placed in another partition, thus attaching a separate EBS drive is not possible.  In short we want to: - Increase the disk space we have on our EC2 instance  The disk needs to be in a single partition   Thanks in advance"
17396,Amazon EC2 V3,"Snapshot the current volume and make a new, larger, volume out of the snapshot.  Create a new instance using the new larger volume as its boot drive.  You will need to resize the partition within the instance (if you're on Linux, you can use resize2fs) to take advantage of the larger volume space."

Maybe this is not caused by the hardware trouble; it maybe caused by conflicting security group rules. Please check your security group rules for port 22, to verify they are correct. (I think you should delete the /32 and keep the /0 rule for port 22 to test). If this does not help you should launch a replacement instance. If it does work you should also do this.

The connections just immediately hang and never finish (we never get a prompt).  We haven't changed our security group settings in the last week.  Also, when I just looked over our Munin records again, the one resource that did spike before the machine went unresponsive was ""process load"".  It looks like the number of processes that were in the run-queue went sky-high, despite the fact that no other resources (CPU, memory, disk, etc.) increased.  Like I mentioned before, there were no user jobs being run, and the user crontab was entirely commented out.  I'll start deploying a new instance now so that we can get off the bad hardware, but I'd still like to understand the root cause of the behavior I'm seeing.

17387,Amazon EC2 V3,"64bit Amazon Linux AMI Missing Vital G++44 package It appears that the libstdc++44.x86_64 package is missing, which means you can't build dynamically linked executables with g++ version 4.4.4.  If you see the commands below, you'll notice that the g++ 4.4.4 compiler assumes that libstdc++ version 6.0.13 exists but in reality only version 6.0.8 is installed. I assume that libstdc++44.x86_64 is missing simply because a libstdc++44-devel exists and a libstdc++.x86_64 exists but no libstdc++44.x86_64.  Does anyone know how to find/add the missing package?

17386,Amazon EC2 V3,DevPay support for billing per web service request processed by EC2 instanc We have a server that processes web services requests.  I need to know if it's possible to bill our customers based on the number of successful web service requests (ones that don't end up in a SOAPException) that an machine instance prcoesses.  Each customer gets a dedicated machine instance.
17386,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi,Amazon EC2 does not provide billing at the per instance granularity.  Instance billing is broken out by each instance size/type within each region.  It sounds, though, like you are inquiring about billing for a DevPay application.  DevPay can be used for billing of your EC2 AMIs.  When signing up for a DevPay application you will be able to set your base price for the EC2 instances as well as either a one time sign up fee or a monthly subscription.For example, the AWS price for an m1.small in US-East is $0.085/hour.  Within the application process you will set your hourly rate for that instance which is billed to your customer.  Out of the markup any applicable DevPay fees are paid to Amazon from you.Since we are not able to bill per request to the instance you may want to factor this into the sign up fee or a monthly subscription charge that will be billed to all your customers.Best Regards,Michelle"
17385,Amazon EC2 V3,"Can't set ulimit nproc ""soft"" limit Hi there,  I'm using the ""Basic 64-bit Amazon Linux AMI 1.0"" image and would like to increase the maximum number of processes per user (ulimit -u) which is set by default to 1024 on this image. So I changed the /etc/security/limits.conf file with the following lines and rebooted the machine:  *                hard    nproc       8192  soft    nproc         8192   [Yes, I know, this changes the settings for ALL users, this is a bad idea and all, but this is a dev machine I don't care and this is not my immediate problem]  After reboot, the hard limit is increased correctly (""ulimit -H -u"" returns 8192) but the soft limit is still at 1024 (""ulimit -S -u"" returns 1024). I can increase the soft limit to 1024 by running ""ulimit -S -u 8192"" since the hard limit is correctly set, but this does not solve my problem because as soon as I start more than 1024 processes, I can no longer log on to the machine because it can't fork the shell process.... I really don't know where this soft limit is set back to 1024, I tried disabling selinux and reseting the sshd config to the bare minimum but no luck so far.....  So if anybody has an idea, that would be most welcome   Thanks"

However, I *can* see them if I cat /proc/partitions.  # ls -l /dev/sd* brwx------ 1 root root 8, 1 Oct 23 22:36 /dev/sda1  # cat /proc/partitions  major minor  #blocks  name     8     1   15728640 sda1    8   128    7340032 sdi  Consequently, my mount requests are failing:  # mount -t xfs /dev/sdi /mnt mount: special device /dev/sdi does not exist  The currently active instance ID is i-78ed3215 and the volume id is vol-ea223783.   Thanks."
17368,Amazon EC2 V3,Anyone have any idea of what else I can look at?  I'm kind of stuck here...
17368,Amazon EC2 V3,"Sounds like udev or equivalent depending on your OS isn't working. You could try creating the device manually by doing  mknod /dev/sdi b 8 128  then make sure the permissions are right, on my system I would do  chown root.disk /dev/sdi chmod 0660 /dev/sdi"
17368,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi. Thanks for the pointer.  That creates the /dev/sdh file, but then:  # mount -t xfs /dev/sdh /mnt  mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdh,        missing codepage or helper program, or other error        In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try        dmesg | tail  or so  # dmesg | tail XFS: SB validate failed XFS: bad magic number XFS: SB validate failed  I'm on Fedora 12 (upgraded from FC8, fresh install).  I've used the FC8 images (amazon's) before, and have never had this issue.  I'm confused what could be going on this time..."
17368,Amazon EC2 V3,"Ok, I was able to fix this. Here's how I did it:  I detached the volume from the instance, waited a few seconds and then re-attached the volume to the instance.  (It's unclear if this is required, but it's what I did.)  Then you can verify that the volume is actually attached:  # cat /proc/partitions  major minor  #blocks  name     8     1   15728640 sda1    8   112    6291456 sdh  In this case, the EBS volume is sdh.  What I wasn't groking before was that the major and minor numbers are listed right there.  So if the device doesn't show up in /dev/, you can--as was suggested--create it.  But when you create it, you have to have the right major/minor numbers, or things don't align.    It seems that the minor number is letter # -1 * 16, so /dev/sde would be (5-1) * 16 = 64. Furthermore /dev/sde1-15 are available. So /dev/sde2 would have a minor number of 66.  I'm sure this is well documented somewhere, I just didn't run across it.    So now that we have the major/minor numbers (from the cat /proc/partitions, no calculations required) we can create the device. In my case I did:  # mknod /dev/sdh b 8 112  And then all is well.  I can then mount:  # mount -t xfs /dev/sdh /mnt  And we're done.  I'm still not sure why this suddenly isn't automatic, but it's working, and I guess that's all that matters."

17343,Amazon EC2 V3,"Elastic Load Balancer: Empty reply from server I run a site on EC2 that has modest amounts of traffic.  It's all housed on one machine.  I want to make it less vulnerable to an instance outage, so I have been investigating the Elastic Load Balancer.  It's not really needed to balance any load, just so that I can have 2 (or more) instances running to reduce outage vulnerability.  This may not be exactly what ELB is intended for, but I've read a lot of posts about people using it for this purpose.  The alternative seems to be to set up something like HAProxy on yet another instance, but this is not really any less vulnerable to an instance outage (in case the HAProxy instance goes down).  I did a test where I had the ELB in front of 2 instances, while I was hitting the site from the command line on my desktop machine, using curl.  It seemed to be evenly distributing the hits between the 2 instances.  Then I stopped one of the instances, meanwhile still hitting the site with curl.  One of my curls had a long wait, and then got the message that curl received an empty reply from the server.  Subsequent requests worked fine.  I concluded from this that the ELB did not realize that one of my instances was down.  I understand there are configurable health checks, which I left at the default setting (30 second interval, 2 failures required).  I don't know if normal requests (not generated from the health check) count in terms of the ELB deciding that an instance is not healthy.  Is there a way that I can set things up to minimize the chance that someone gets an empty reply when/if one of my instances goes down?  I was hoping that the ELB would try another instance rather than returning an empty reply."
17343,Amazon EC2 V3,"You're using ELB appropriately, don't worry.  You can choose a small health check period to minimize the time that an unhealthy instance would still get traffic. But ELB does not monitor the responses from an instance to determine health."
17343,Amazon EC2 V3,"Thanks for answering the question about whether normal responses are taken into account when determining instance health.  Perhaps this is naive, but ... that seems strange to me.  I can understand why you'd want to have proactive health checks, but why wouldn't you also infer that an instance is down when it doesn't reply to a normal request?  If a site is receiving moderate traffic when an instance goes down, you're going to have a bunch of requests that get no reply before the 2 health checks are going to fail.  I realize that you can configure the health checks to be more frequent, and to require just one failure, but it just seems like you'd have to generate a lot of useless traffic that way, instead of getting information from the organic traffic that the ELB is already handling."

17339,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi Slevin.  Even if the server your node is hosted on is running at 110% yours would still say 0% if it was actually doing nothing.  Id suggest you've got a program starting automatically every month and is running awol and using a very high amount of cpu time or memory. because the small instance only has one cpu every other program has to compete for resources. in this scenario, 30 seconds to open a screen session is not a surprising delay.  from your graph and the limited information, perhaps something is running twice a month. first it is consuming 40% cpu, then another 40% on the 15th."

And I am probably a complete beginner in this as I was searching a lot but did not find a solution yet. So can you please tell what do you mean by promising results on google search? Maybe I am missing something simple and obvious?I will be more detailed about what I did and found so far: I decided to use Java and Eclipse IDE. Eclipse provides SDK for both - Android and AWS. But, existing AWS libraries need to be recompiled to be used in Dalvik. I did that - recompiled them all from source and managed to contact AWS first time yesterday - like, getting XML response from AWS in my Android app - where I see the List of my buckets - BUT, I am missing stax library so cannot parse that response. The reason is since Android is complaining that I try to recompile core library. Here are links with other people's similar issues:http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=1332http://www.peecho.com/blog/2010/9/3/android-upload-to-amazon-s3.htmlSo, all AWS and third-party libraries from AWS Java SDK are recompiled (simply using Eclipse) in my case- but stax library stax-1.2.0.jar is problematic.Maybe there is some simpler way than the one I am trying? Please, any suggestion would be helpful.Thanks in advance,Sanja"
17331,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi Sanja,I had the same problem as you, but managed to work around it! I don't know if this is helpful, but nevertheless, here goes! As I understand it, there's three ways to deal with it:1. Fork the AWS API, and replace StAX with the Android XML parser.2. Use JarJar Links as described in that Google Code article you've linked to.3. Force the use of --core-library.I picked the third as I didn't want to fork the AWS API. It was a bit of a pain to do this because the default ant rules template file fails with Android SDK r 7 (why on earth is it there in the first place? :P).I wrote down what I did here. I am now able to query AWS services (haven't tested exhaustively, but I've checked out a few EC2 API commands). Anyway, here's the link: http://code.google.com/p/elastic-droid/wiki/AWSonAndroid?ts=1287930548&updated=AWSonAndroidThis is pretty obviously a bit of a nasty kludge, but is the best I can think of for the mo. And hey, it seems to work!!! If any of you knows of a better way, please let me know. On second thoughts, don't; I'd +vely cry if there was a far simpler way to do it.;)Hope this helps!Cheers,Sid"
17331,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi,Thanks a lot for complete explanation. And yes, for as much as I could have found - I agree with your three solutions.The --core library option is really not the best thing to use due to compatibility - but again, for proceeding with it and testing my application it seems I will use it.I was actually trying with this explanation on how to repackage stax-api.jar, but now it seems that then again I would have to fork AWS? I was not aware of that, but if it is so - then that is not a good solution, definitely. I asked the author of that explanation (using jar jar links) to make myself sure if that is true. Hope I will get some answer soon.Again - thanks a lot,and yes - if anyone else has better solution -please inform us.Best,"
17331,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi,The reason I think you need to fork AWS to use jarjar links is because of the last two sections of the http://code.google.com/p/dalvik/wiki/JavaxPackages documentation: Factory Registration and Factory Class Loaders. In the first case, you need to tell calls to import ""javax.xml.*"" to use ""com.sun.whatever"", which requires changes to the AWS API. In the second case, you need to tell the SDK to use the application's class loader, which I think would additionally tie your SDK to Android implementations.I might talking through the proverbial hat here, but this is what I understood, and this is why I chose to go the --core-library route, and be prepared for some major effort come Gingerbread time."

For a given requested period:Minimum = minimum collected value during the requested periodMaximum = maximum collected value during the requested periodAverage = average bytes transferred during the requested periodSO, lets say you asked for a 5 minute metric and the collected data points were1, 2, 3, 5, 4The min would be 1, the max would be 5 and the average would be 3Whether the values are the same will depend on how many samples are actually taken in the period - the statistic SampleCount will give you that information.In terms of percentiles - that is good feedback. We are looking at additional statistics that will be useful. Do you look at other statistics beyond 95th percentile?"
17327,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi Chris,Thanks for the response, that makes more sense now (especially the SampleCount graph).I realise that the data is provided in bytes deivered, as that is how data billed. When I mentioned the 95th percentile, that is because in the past we were billed on the 95th percentile figure.However it would be nice to see the Mbps to be able to determine how ""full"" a server is with regards to their network utilsation (i.e. if using 800Mbps on a 1Gbps port, it might be time to launch a new instance).I understand we can get an approximte figure by multiplying the sum by 8 and dividing by the interval duration.Many Thanks,Ady"

17320,Amazon EC2 V3,"Really booting an AMI from an existing EBS Volume (not an EBS Snapshot) Is it possible to create an EBS backed AMI where the boot device (e.g. /dev/sda1) is mapped to an existing EBS *volume* ? I've been researching this for a couple of days and trying all sorts of things. It seems like this question was getting at the same thing:http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/thread.jspa?messageID=157958&#157958And I can get as far as starting my AMI (which is based on an EBS snapshot) and having it create a new EBS volume of any size. This new EBS volume (let's call it vol-123) is not deleted when the machine shuts down (i.e. deleteOnTermination=F). But what's next? How do I start new instance (from an AMI) and have it use the existing EBS Volume vol-123 as the boot device? I think I could create a snapshot after changing the root file system, then update my AMI definition to reflect the new snapshot. Then I could terminate and spin back up maintaining hard drive state. But I really wanted to avoid having to remember to snapshot and update the AMI. If I was able to really boot from the EBS volume then this would all be much smoother. I could take snapshots for backup, but I would not lose changes to the root file system if I failed to snapshot. Is this possible or is ""boot from EBS"" really a misnomer and it should be ""boot from EBS Snapshot into an EBS volume?""-JD"
17320,Amazon EC2 V3,"An AMI can't be ""updated"" to refer to a different snapshot - or at all. You'd need to create a new AMI with the new snapshot.  It sounds like you can use the Stop / Start controls instead of Terminate / Launch. Stopping an EBS-backed instance leaves the volume intact, ready to be booted from when you Start it again. In the mmeantime you're only charged for the EBS volume, not any CPU hours."
17320,Amazon EC2 V3,"Shlomo, thanks for replying so quickly on a Sunday! I clearly don't grok a few things. I was under the impression I could alter attributes of an existing AMI (e.g. which snapshot the AMI is associated with) which, it appears I can't. Thanks for clearing that up. It makes sense that I could halt an instance and then bring it back without losing state. However, the workflow I was hoping to accomplish is to have an AMI running, then if I needed more RAM or more CPUs then I could terminate the instance and bring it back up with a larger machine type while maintaining state.If I understand how EBS backed AMIs work, this workflow is really quite hard to do. To take an existing instance which is booting from EBS and move to a higher CPU machine type I would have to do the following:1) Take a snapshot of the existing EBS2) create a new AMI based on the new snapshot3) terminate the ""too small"" instance4) bring up new EC2 instance based on the snapshot created in step #1 but using larger machine typeThen if I want to go back to the smaller machine type, I'd have to do all of these steps again. And every time I did this round trip I'd end up with 2 new AMIs and 2 new snapshots.Ugh. Just keeping track of the AMIs and EBS snapshots sounds like a bear. Even if I do a series of scripts this sounds tedious at best. Surely I'm not the first to have desired this workflow of shutting down, booting to a larger machine type, then back to the smaller machine type without losing state. Is there a simpler way?-JD"

17320,Amazon EC2 V3,"Peter, that is VERY helpful. I didn't realize I could change the instance type without terminating the instance. I just tested this using the command line tools and it worked like a champ. After stopping the instance I just ran the following:ec2-modify-instance-attribute <myInstanceID> -t m1.xlargeWhat was throwing me off with the physical world analogy, is in the physical world I have to pull a machine from the rack to change its machine type. Thus I was hung up on terminating the instance before changing type. I can now easily write a script that stops an instance, changes the instance type, then restarts. EXACTLY what I need to do!

17308,Amazon EC2 V3,"Does the volume show up in your list of volumes?  You can always mount it on another machine if it's still there.  Also, do you have any snapshots?  If the data is critical you should be making regular snapshots, just like you'd back up any other important data."
17308,Amazon EC2 V3,Anyone??? It also completely dissapeared from management console.....
17308,Amazon EC2 V3,We have partial backup. But it too heavy and it will take too long to bring it back again. Also there was home directories and there is no chance to get back working instance without volume. I can't find any snapshots from volumes witch are not present in volumes list. But I'm almost sure that there should be at least one...
17308,Amazon EC2 V3,Anybody??? Is there any chance to get it back?
17308,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi yyevgen,Do you have a volume ID that I may check?Regards,Scott"
17308,Amazon EC2 V3,Volume disappeared and I don't remeber it's ID. Is there any ways to find it without ID?
17308,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi yyevgen,I only saw two EBS volumes that were attached to that instance (vol-fed39697 and vol-46c7552f), and both still exist. Can you ensure that you've searched through any additional pages of volumes that you have, and that you're looking in the correct region?Regards,Scott"
17308,Amazon EC2 V3,I'm sure. There were three volumes.
17308,Amazon EC2 V3,It was mounted as /dev/sdb on that instance.
17308,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi yyevgen,I don't see any EBS volumes that were attached to /dev/sdb for that particular instance, even prior to any stops and starts. However, it looks like the device, /dev/sdb, was local instance storage. As this is the case, you'll need to recover from your backups. In the future, you'll probably want to use your EBS volumes for critical data instead of local (ephemeral) instance storage. I'm truly sorry for the operational pain this has caused you.Best Regards,Scott"
17307,Amazon EC2 V3,"feature request: properties for Elastic IP AWS folks,In order to help organize Elastic IPs it would be good to be able to associate some user-specified text with an Elastic IP. This would primarily be used for a name, description, etc. I recommend a general ""properties"" mechanism similar to what you have for EC2 instances. That would give users flexibility to create properties that are useful to them and show/hide them in the AWS Management Console. Thanks,Michael"
17307,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hello,I really appreciate your feedback!I've already escalated your request to related internal team."
17307,Amazon EC2 V3,"+1  It would be really nice to be able to tag Elastic IPs.  When doing manual re-association,  I could just look at the eIP instead of having to look elsewhere to figure out which eIP is for which of my external services."
17307,Amazon EC2 V3,+1 for me as well - just saw this option for the AMI's - which is GREAT!

17304,Amazon EC2 V3,"Amazon LINUX AMI (64bit)Use of XFS for EBS volumes as recomended by Eric? All,I am using Amazon LINUX AMI(64 bit) to create my infrastructure. I was following steps as dictated by wonderful eric's article for ""Running mySQL on EBS.I created a volume and attached to the instance( as can be seen in attached file) .A volume is attached to /dev/sdfBut when i execute command sudo mkfs.xfs /dev/sdfIt returns/dev/sdf : no such file or directory.Please help - Since i can see this volume attached to the instance. Why system is saying its not there?.Is it Amazon Linux AMI doesn't allow other volumes to attach to the instance.????"
17304,Amazon EC2 V3,"Due to a device name change in the newer kernels used by the Amazon Linux AMI, the block devices are now named /dev/xvdX instead of /dev/sdX. in your case, I think you would want to check whether the /dev/xvdf device appears. We're working on a way to make this simpler for Amazon Linux AMI users."
17304,Amazon EC2 V3,Thank you !. I will try reading with new device name.So does that mean while creating and attaching volume to my instance i should give/dev/xvd X instead of /dev/sd X as device name
17304,Amazon EC2 V3,"Sadly, not yet. Older kernels on other AMIs will continue to see the attached devices as sdX while newer kernels will see them as xvdX. At attach time we have no real way of knowing how the kernel in the AMI will name the device. There are various ways to deal with the naming discrepancy, such as filesystem labels (using LABEL=xxx in fstab instead of the device name) or filesystem UUIDs (using UUID=xxx in fstab). We are working on a better and more deterministic solution for this though."
17304,Amazon EC2 V3,"Thanks christian for your reply. But can we somehow via command line detect what the kernel in AMI named the device.  You mentioned ""There are various ways to deal with the naming discrepancy, such as filesystem labels (using LABEL=xxx in fstab instead of the device name) or filesystem UUIDs (using UUID=xxx in fstab). We are working on a better and more deterministic solution for this though. ""  How i can attach my volume to the instance using LABELS/UUID's. ? Can you provide me little detail with command if possible. Thanks Sumeer"
17304,Amazon EC2 V3,"To detect what block devices you end up with on the system, there are various places you can look at. You could look at /proc/partitions and infer from there which devices you end up with. You can also look at the /sys/block/ directory listing and see again which devices you have on the system after attaching a block device.Once you have found the device, you can put a filesystem on it (be it ext[234] or xfs) and label it accordingly using a flag like -L my_label_name. ie,mkfs.xfs -L my_label_name ... /dev/xvdformkfs.ext3 -L my_label_name ... /dev/xvdgOnce that is done, in /etc/fstab you can list the device for mounting like this:LABEL=my_label_name /data ext3 noauto 0 0Also, when a filesystem is created, a unique UUID is automatically assigned to it - you can also use that to mount using UUID=uuid syntax instead of LABEL=label syntax I showed above. Commands such as xfs_admin or tune2fs can be used to manipulate/extract the label and UUID data for filesystems already created."

However, I would want to use an instance with a RAM larger than 1.7GB (that's the max I see on 32bit Linux). Is there a way I can either get more RAM on 32 bit or use only 32bits on the 64 bit instance (if that's even possible)?Please let me know.Thanks!"
17303,Amazon EC2 V3,I'm sure your refering to this http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/for the list of instance types and its memory.It's not possible to  increase the memory on 32bit. Why not recompile your program on the 64bit to be able to run it?

17303,Amazon EC2 V3,We also have the same issue with being stuck with a 32-bit third party application on a 32-bit windows server instance with only 1.7G memory.

Is the number of concurrent users for Remote Desktop limited, and if so to how many?

17301,Amazon EC2 V3,We also have the same dilemma where Amazon drop down choices for 32-bit windows instance only go as high as 5 virtual core cpu and 1.7G memory max. They don't have any options for higher memory resources.

17274,Amazon EC2 V3,"Will EBS backed instances survive a failure/crash/reboot of its host? I started to experiment with EC2 micro instances and have been operating under the assumption that my instances are more or less ""safe"" from being lost since they are able to be shutdown and rebooted. After playing with UEC I am now wondering if that assumption is actually incorrect.  If for some reason the host for my EBS backed instances goes down will the instance be lost? Or will it come back after the host has come back online? I would ask the same question for whatever other magical components are involved in keeping my instances alive.  I realize that there is always the possibility that a drive will crash or fail and that even if it was a dedicated physical server I could lose the system. However, servers do go down for not fatal reasons... hopefully more often than they actually crash hard. In the case that there is a non fatal interruption of service, I need to know if I should be prepared to rebuild my instance or if I can assume that it will come back online on its own."

17267,Amazon EC2 V3,Hi there you have not posted your instance ID so I can't check out the status of you server. Common problems that could be effecting your ability to access your instance from another machine is your security groups in AWS console not configured correctly to allow traffic on port 80 or a problem on the firewall inside your instance blocking traffic to port 80.If your still having problems please post the instance id and we will check it out for you.

17266,Amazon EC2 V3,"Disitribution of Elastic Loadbalancer traffic Is it an expected behavior of the Elastic Loadbalancer to distribute traffic from all klients behind a single IP to the same instance?  A lot of our costumers are schools, big and small, and as I can see all traffic from one school will end up on the same instance? This means that you have to prepare the performance of every single instances to be able to take all the load from on of these single klilent locations.  Can this be correct?"

17263,Amazon EC2 V3,"ec2config fails to start Hi,  Has anyone else had an issue with ec2config failing to start?  I've been working on an EBS AMI for Windows 2003 and generally everything works.  The big exception is that seemingly randomly the ec2config service will fail to automatically start.  This causes a nasty popup to appear stating that a service or driver failed to start up properly and effectively brings my instance up in an inconsistent state.  Like I said though, it doesn't happen for every instance created from the AMI and it changes from reboot-to-reboot.  For what it's worth, these are micro instances that I'm testing with.  Does anyone know how to fix this?  Thanks, Kevin"
17263,Amazon EC2 V3,"I have definitely and am currently experiencing the same issue. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to it. It looks like windows doesn't even try to start the Ec2Config Service -- there is nothing in the ec2config log files or in the system event log. There service is set to start up automatically. This even happens on an AMI that is snapshot from instance that has no problems with starting the EC2Config service. There is also nothing in the console output for the machineAlso I have seem some randomness in the ability to RDP into instances, as if the Terminal Services service is not starting. This does not bode well for using windows instances in EC2."

17261,Amazon EC2 V3,"INTRA INSTANCE COMMUNICATION Assuming a configuration with single DB server (SQL) + multiple IIS/App servers which start/stop according to the load. What is the best practice to establish  communication between the IIS/APP servers and the SQL server ?  Should I use Elastic IP attached to the  SQL server ? (Does this effect speed or charges?)Should I use Elastic IP attached to the SQL server  just to obtain it's internal IP?I don't really need an Elastic IP for public access to the SQL server, so... is there any other option for the IIS/APP servers to discover the SQL server ? In this configuration how should the SQL, exposing port 1433 be guarded against attacks from the INTERNET or the EC2 CLOUD, not knowing ahead the IP's of it's callers ? Should I consider ""central  IP hub application"", running off an instance with elastic IP (so anyone know where it is) to synchronise dynamically the IP's of the server and clients (for access and dynamic configuration of the server's firewall) ?Apologize, I'm not intimate with VPC (and have no need for VPN with the outside world) ...If I create a VPC with all those instances can I serve HTTP requests   using some public IP/DNS ? Thx"
17261,Amazon EC2 V3,Hi there nl65 I think you are asking two different questions here one about elastic ip addresses and their application and your second  question is about VPC.As you are probably aware when you start a new instance or restart an existing instance you will get a dhcp address assigned at start-up time.Your first QuestionAn elastic ip allows you to have a effectively a static address that you can map to you instances giving you clients a static point to attach to. These clients could be your Windows Server IIS machines attaching to your SQl server or it could be web users hitting your domain name that is associated with your Elastic ip which then attached to your web server.Your second QuestionVPC is you own Virtual Private Cloud that is connected to your router extending your companies network securely into the cloud. In this case you are basically running EC2 computing resources inside your own network. If you need to grant internet access to your EC2 resources from inside your VPC you would need to direct traffic via your own internet gateway and firewall equipment. One other note you cannot use elastic IP's inside a VPC as you are using you own network address numbering scheme in a VPC.I have included links to the documentation guides for EC2 and and VPC you can find more comprehensive instructions inside these guides.EC2 Documentationhttp://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ec2/VPC Documentation http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/vpc/ I hope this answers your questions.
17261,Amazon EC2 V3,"You can use Elastic IP for the SQL Server instance, then use its domain name from your clients.  They will get the private IP address.  You do NOT need to open 1433 to the outside world.  Just set up a security group on the SQL Server instance that allow only the clients in."

17250,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi Fred,The YUM repositories are served from S3. We currently have the beta version of the Amazon Linux AMI configured to use a local S3 bucket in each region. This default configuration might change in the future to fall back to buckets in other regions.We're investigating the error you're seeing."
17250,Amazon EC2 V3,"Fred,Have you sorted out the iptables issue you mentioned in this thread: http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/message.jspa?messageID=195892#195892"
17250,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi Matt,  The iptables were not the issue, I have the ""yum install"" issue even before I change the iptables. I can confirm that. The iptables were redirecting tcp port 80 to 8080 for Tomcat, so nothing out of the ordinary that would interfere with YUM, I think.  There is a big issue when I do ""yum clean"", I lose the repository cached and that's it, cannot install anything anymore in Southeast. I think I can throw away my instance and start again.  I'll have to redo all the work on my instance in the US to finish my setup.  Is there a way to transfer an AMI from one region to another?  Thanks  Fred"

17242,Amazon EC2 V3,"PCI Compliance - TCP reset and BGP Hi,  I'm struggling to find a solution to the following vulnerability flagged up by a PCI compliancy scan. Any help or pointers would be greatly appreciated.  Description: TCP reset using approximate sequence number Severity: Potential Problem CVE: CVE-2004-0230  Impact: A remote attacker could cause a denial of service on systems which rely upon persistent TCP connections. Background: The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is the protocol used by services such as telnet, ftp, and smtp to establish a connection between a client and a server. Every TCP packet includes a sequence number in the header to ensure that all packets are received at the destination and re-assembled in the correct order. The sequence numbering begins with an initial sequence number which is chosen by the server and sent to the client when the connection is established. Thus, sequence numbers also help to verify the identity of the client, since only the intended client has knowledge of the initial sequence number. The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a TCP protocol used by routers to exchange routing information. It is primarily used by Internet service providers.  Resolution: To correct this problem on Cisco devices, apply one of the fixes referenced in the Cisco security advisories for [http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20040420-tcp-ios.shtml] IOS and [http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20040420-tcp-nonios.shtml] non-IOS operating systems. Refer to [http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/415294#systems] US-CERT Vulnerability Note VU#415294 and [http://www.uniras.gov.uk/niscc/docs/re-20040420-00391.pdf?lang=en] NISSC vulnerability advisory 236929 for other vendor fixes. If a fix is not available, this problem can be worked around by using a secure protocol such as [http://rfc.net/rfc2411.html] IPsec, or by filtering incoming connections to services such as BGP which rely on persistent TCP connections at the firewall, such that only allowed addresses may reach them.  Vulnerability Details: Service: tcp sent spoofed RST packet, received RST packet  The target IP is an instance with the Linux AMI.  Thanks"
17242,Amazon EC2 V3,This came up earlier but no one from AWS commented on it:  http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/thread.jspa?messageID=173732

17242,Amazon EC2 V3,That's the exact same error we have been getting trying to pass this security metrics test!I'm guessing that's who you are using as well?
17242,Amazon EC2 V3,"Yep, spot on.  Come on, there must be someone who has run into the same issue and solved it or someone in the Amazon team that knows this..."
17242,Amazon EC2 V3,Well we are facing the same issue with SecurityMetrics. I hope someone from Amazon can look into this as soon as possible!
17242,Amazon EC2 V3,Presuming that I'd get no quick joy from Amazon on this I sent off a query to SecurityMetrics directly.  Then I found this posting:http://forums.cpanel.net/f5/irresolvable-pci-scan-failure-167610.htmlwhich discusses SecurityMetrics and this failurel.  The post says a SM user received an email from SecurityMetrics stating that this may be a false positive scan.  He suggests contacting support at SecurityMetrics to get on some mailing list.So - suggest you do the same!
17242,Amazon EC2 V3,"Thanks tdsproule, very helpful indeed. I asked my SM contact if this was a false positive and I'm still waiting for a reply. It's reassuring to know it may well be the case."
17242,Amazon EC2 V3,Well it turned out to be a bit of a red herring!  After speaking with Security Metrics technical support it looks like they had some issues around the threat level associated with vulnerability tests.   CVE-2004-0230 was incorrectly flagged at risk level '10'.  They simply re-ran a scan against our service and we returned to our normal passing status.  Suggest you simply manually re-run your scan.

17229,Amazon EC2 V3,HTTP Authentication on Load Balancers I would like to use a url like this for the load balancer through the management console:  user:password@/  Is there anyway to allow this type of url into the load balancer?  The rationale is that I need to test load balancing on a staging environment that I don't want to expose to the Internet - this would be the simplest solution.
17229,Amazon EC2 V3,"can't be done with the way ELB exists now.  you could use a TCP health check instead of HTTP.  it wouldn't give you as robust of a test, but it might be enough depending on your purposes."
17229,Amazon EC2 V3,You can achieve this using aiCache as your load balancer.  Drop a copy locally using the demo license.  Once configured and tested you would drop the same config onto the running aiCache instance on AWS. This would allow you to isolate your testing environment. -support Demo http://aicache.com AWS offering http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=2366

17226,Amazon EC2 V3,"m2.4xlarge less memory than advertised Hi all,I have started a m2.4xlarge instance which should have 68.4GB of memory. The instance only came up with 32GB however. Has anyone else run into a similar issue? I have double-checked that the instance type is correct. I've seen this issue in both EU-west and US-east.Cheers  Message was edited by: mbsmr"
17226,Amazon EC2 V3,I have encountered the same problem on i-07515b6d running US-east. I am using the Amazon 64bit Linux AMI (ami-8cc035e5)  /proc/meminfo reports: MemTotal:       32814112 kB  I'm wondering if this is a problem with the instance or the AMI's kernel?
17226,Amazon EC2 V3,I tried the fedora 64bit AMI and it came up with the expected amount of memory.
17226,Amazon EC2 V3,Amazon has confirmed this reported problem. We are currently working on the problem and hopefully will have a fix shortly.
17226,Amazon EC2 V3,this is still the case.  any idea when 64GB will be available?
17226,Amazon EC2 V3,"Any update on this issue? Is it related to hardware allocation or Amazon Linux? We're trying to test our app in the high memory environment and not having access to this memory is really inconvenient.  Also, who do we talk to about billing related to this issue? We've been billed for m2.4xlarge instances and haven't been getting the amount of memory we're paying for."
17226,Amazon EC2 V3,The problem lies in the kernel configuration. The current beta version of the Amazon Linux AMI is using a newer pv_ops kernel. A new CONFIG_XEN_MAX_DOMAIN_MEMORY kernel configuration parameter was introduced in the upstream pv_ops kernel. An error in our configuration file merging reverted the value of this parameter to 32 when we were updating the kernel.This issue will be corrected with the next refresh of the AMI.
17226,Amazon EC2 V3,"Ah, okay. Can you give me an ETA on the next refresh of the AMI? Are there docs anywhere for doing a kernel update on an existing instance so I can grab these changes for my AMIs?"
17226,Amazon EC2 V3,Did some digging and discovered the docs for updating the kernel using yum. Looked through the sources and found in config-generic where CONFIG_XEN_MAX_DOMAIN_MEMORY is set. Is it likely safe for me to just change that number to 70 and recompile the kernel with config-generic as its config file?

Badly written clients that only send http requests using \n instead of \r\n eventually get 503 errors after a long delay.  I quoted ""problem"" because its not really amazon's fault. We should be sending CRLF instead. But I discovered this happens only when using the load balancers. Other web servers or proxy servers I had handy seems to accept it no problems (apache, litespeed, varnish and squid). I guess its some sort of pseudo standard?  I immediately suspected the loadbalancer is just parsing the http request incorrectly. We have it in sticky mode: Stickiness: AppCookieStickinessPolicy, cookieName='PHPSESSID' But disabling the stickiness all together did not help. I guess it is still parsing the requests anyway.  The temporary solution was quite obvious. Ive setup a loadbalancer with TCP for port 80 instead. Which works just fine. (I like stickyness, but its not absolutely necessary for us).

17209,Amazon EC2 V3,"Elastic Block Storage offers persistence.  EBS volumes are stored independently of the instance and will continue to persist even if the instance itself fails.  You can even have the root storage device persist after the instance shuts down, so you can bring it back up on another instance.For scaling, you have two main options.  The primary scaling mechanism in EC2 is adding more instances; this is a scale out architecture.  So if your web server is getting overloaded, add a second on and load balance between them.  The other option is to run a larger instance size and move your volumes over; this does result in some downtime, but allows you to grow the CPU/RAM but use your existing EBS volumes.Lastly, Elastic Load Balancers can provide Omnipresence.  You can use ELB with autoscaling and CloudWatch to guarantee that you always have N identical machines running, and make sure requests go to to functional instances only.  If an instance fails, then ELB will stop sending it requests (in as little as 6 seconds) and autoscaling will automatically start a replacement instance.Does this help?"

17187,Amazon EC2 V3,"And on second thought, it looks like I didn't quite accurately capture the true question.I think what we really need to know is whether a single S3 bucket in, say, the ""US"" location can contain AMIs which can be run in multiple EC2 regions, say, ""us-east-1"" and ""us-west-1"". I see a number of different possible designs:1. Any AMI in bucket-US can be run in all EC2 us-* regions (with the same AMI id).2. Any single AMI bundle/manifest in bucket-US can be registered to be run in multiple EC2 us-* regions (with different AMI ids in each region).3. Each AMI in bucket-US runs in a single EC2 region, but different AMIs in that bucket could target different us-* regions.4. Each S3 bucket can only contain AMIs targeted at a single EC2 region.Any clues about which of the above might or might not be possible in the future would be appreciated."
17187,Amazon EC2 V3,"Like you said earlier, I think only Amazon can answer this.  S3 takes a fundamentally different approach than the other services and AWS will either have to continue to allow those differences between Location and Region to exist or make significant and probably incompatible changes in S3 to align it to Regions.As it stands now, I think if a ""us-west-1"" region were created for EC2, images stored anywhere in the US location in S3 would be accessible to both ""us-west-1"" and ""us-east-1"" and it would therefore be impossible to determine the Region strictly from the Location.Mitch"
17187,Amazon EC2 V3,"Well, just to close this thread, amazon answered this question with the creation of us-west-1.AMIs created in us-west-1 for instance-store must exist in a bucket in location ""US-WEST-1"".So, At the moment, location:region mapping is:US: us-east-1EU: eu-west-1us-west-1: us-west-1ap-southeast-1: ap-southeast-1Some time back, when this issue was resolved, I sent patch to s3cmd at http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=alpine.DEB.2.00.0912101316040.31780%40brickies&forum_name=s3tools-general"
17186,Amazon EC2 V3,"help with bucket location Hi, I'm in need of some help.  I fear that it is not solveable without help fromamazon.A few months ago I created some buckets using s3cmd in anticipation of us-west-1 (and other regions being created).  Now that those regions exist, I wanted to publish some images to them.  However, attemps to    ec2-upload-bundle --location us-west-1results in:   ERROR: Bucket ""ubuntu-kernels-testing-us-west-1"" location does not match specified location.The following are empty buckets that I've created that I would like to appear in the us-west-1 location.   ubuntu-images-milestone-us-west-1   ubuntu-images-sandbox-us-west-1   ubuntu-images-testing-us-west-1   ubuntu-images-us-west-1   ubuntu-kernels-sandbox-us-west-1   ubuntu-kernels-testing-us-west-1   ubuntu-kernels-us-west-1I recall from previous cases that a delete and recreate takes quite a long time before the resource is actually freed.  Is there any way that I can get the above buckets with a location in us-west-1 ?"
17186,Amazon EC2 V3,"Well, in a scrambling effort, i've deleted many of the buckets, now, an upload-bundle fails like:$ ec2-upload-bundle --bucket ubuntu-kernels-testing-us-west-1 --location us-west-1 --manifest out/bogus.img.manifest.xml Creating bucket...Uploading bundled image parts to the S3 bucket ubuntu-kernels-testing-us-west-1 ...Failed to upload ""out/bogus.img.part.0"": Server.NoSuchBucket(404): The specified bucket does not existERROR: Failed to upload ""out/bogus.img.part.0"": Server.NoSuchBucket(404): The specified bucket does not existNote, it says ""Creating bucket..."" but apparently not."
17186,Amazon EC2 V3,"+1Folks can't really use the new us-west-1 region announced by Amazon until their favorite AMIs are available in that region.  These official Ubuntu AMIs that Scott Moser is trying to migrate over are the ones I am now recommending, and there should be a lot of customers waiting to use them.If there is a way to get these buckets in the correct region, it would be nice to execute it quickly.  If there is going to be a delay in being able to create these buckets, then please let Scott know so that alternate bucket names can be considered (though these names are the most desired for long term consistency)."
17186,Amazon EC2 V3,I ended up getting help from amazon on this topic.  They were able to manually expire the buckets to clean them up for me.

17172,Amazon EC2 V3,"Lost instance I'm testing EC2 and I was in a windows instance that was running for a couple of hours.  I created a VPN connection to our network and installed software.   Then I disconnected the VPN and at that time my RDP connection dropped, and I could not re-connect.  I then went to the AWS Management console and my instance was gone!  How to I ensure that my instance is not lost in the future, and is there a way to retrieve the lost instance? -Nathan  Message was edited by: Nathan Slemmer"
17172,Amazon EC2 V3,"Ok, now my instance is showing up again.  Is this normal for an instance to disappear?"
17171,Amazon EC2 V3,"firewall question We recently had a vulnerability assessment done against an instance we have on EC2 (cloud.lincware.com).  One of the results was shown below.  I'm no security expert but it seems this issue (if it is not a false-positive) is happening on Amazon's firewall and is not specific to our instance ... can anyone comment on whether or not this vulnerability is real?  Synopis/Description:	The remote host seems to generate Initial Sequence Numbers (ISN) in a weak manner which seems to solely depend on the source and dest port of the TCP packets. An attacker may exploit this flaw to establish spoofed connections to the remote host. The Raptor Firewall and Novell Netware are known to be vulnerable to this flaw, although other network devices may be vulnerable as well. (NOTE: This may prove to be a false positive.) Solution:	If you are using a Raptor Firewall, see http://www.symantec.com/techsupp/bulletin/archive/firewall/082002firewall.html Otherwise, contact your vendor for a patch. Reference : http://online.securityfocus.com/archive/1/285729"
17171,Amazon EC2 V3,"Perhaps someone with more detailed knowledge of the specific vulnerability can add to my comments below - I'm guessing here to the best of my knowledge.  It seems to me that the vulnerability described is only effective against stateful firewalls: that is, firewalls that can be used to selectively allow or disallow communications based on the state of the TCP connection. If an attacker can convince a stateful firewall that it already has an existing connection, it may be able to penetrate the firewall.  EC2's firewall is a stateless firewall, making its decisions solely on the basis of the packet's source address and target port. Manipulating the TCP connection state will not matter. Attempts to spoof a connection will still need to originate from the allowed source IP address, to the allowed target port - so the attack can only succeed from behind the same public IP address as the authorized clients.  One might try to subvert the routing infrastructure of the intervening network hops between the target and EC2 and spoof packet source addresses this way. But this vulnerability is different from the one reported by your assessment, and not one that is EC2-specific  As I said, it would be helpful for someone with experience in this particular vulnerability to chime in."
17171,Amazon EC2 V3,"I'm not sure that the EC2 firewall is stateless, based on my experience (which you can try for yourself)http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/thread.jspa?messageID=171252"
17171,Amazon EC2 V3,Hmm... that's a good point. I wonder if that means the EC2 firewall is vulnerable. Might be worth a shot to test.
17171,Amazon EC2 V3,Can anyone inside Amazon comment here?
17171,Amazon EC2 V3,Still no input from the Amazon folks...?Found this link which confirms the firewall is stateful: http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry!default.jspa?categoryID=152&externalID=1697&fromSearchPage=true

17170,Amazon EC2 V3,"Need some ""backup"" advice Hi,  I need some advise on how to survive a system failure. We have a single instance running Windows 2008 Server running from an EBS volume, and to that we have two volumes attached (data volumes). I would like to be able to spin up a new copy of our instance in case of failure, and for that I need to create an AMI.   1) What would be the right way to create a AMI. Should I shut show IIS on the server, detach the two datavolumes, stop the instance, create AMI, start the instance, attach the data volumes and restart IIS.

Regarding the last two questions, I can't really speculate as to what happened to keep the volume states for these volumes in attaching, and am not aware of any issues within the past two or three days that would impact your volumes in this way. You can look at the Service Health Dashboard to check historic widespread issues:http://status.aws.amazon.com/If the forced detachment doesn't work, please let me know. Regards,Scott"

17166,Amazon EC2 V3,"AWS has said that all availability zones in EU-West-1 are in Ireland. Availability zones are identical except for how they get network connectivity, power, etc.  The concept is that if a something fails (a construction crew cuts power, an air conditioning chiller fails etc) it will not impact both zones.  This allows for designing redundant systems by placing instances in different availability zones."

Couple of days ago I received email from Amazon that they could not bill my credit card in order to collect 10 cents for the S3 data. I logged into my account to see what going on and for the first time in my life I saw this message:  ""You have 7 charges past due. Please pay the amount in full to avoid suspension or termination of your AWS Account."" ""Select past charges and pay now""  So I clicked that and to my surprise I saw this:  ""Please pay the amount in full to avoid suspension or termination of your AWS account""    Billing Period, Bill Details,  You owe   June 1, 2009 - June 30, 2009, Bill Details, $ 92.14   April 1, 2009 - April 30, 2009, Bill Details, $ 90.12   January 1, 2009 - January 31, 2009, Bill Details, $ 91.57   November 1, 2008 - November 30, 2008, Bill Details, $ 87.24   August 1, 2008 - August 31, 2008, Bill Details, $ 93.78   April 1, 2008 - April 30, 2008, Bill Details, $ 88.49   February 1, 2008 - February 29, 2008, Bill Details, $ 83.92  Total Amount You Owe $627.26 Amount You Selected to Pay $627.26  I just spent an hour filtering the online billing records on my card for the past three years and it seems according to the records that Amazon is right - they did not billed me, according to my card records. I have difficult time figuring out how this could happened, since AWS billing is a monthly routine for me.   I will talk to my bank on Monday to see if they can provide my with paper billing details regrading this and will probably pay if it is my fault, but I think it is not good business practice to bill your clients 30 months later.

17138,Amazon EC2 V3,"whitelisting tons of IPs permitted in security group? Greetings  Would it be possible to whitelist thousands of IPs in one single group? The closest I could find was a cautionary note (1) and a discussion regarding the max number of security groups but not the number of rules per group (2).   Reason being, we have a SaaS with pretty well definable Source IPs connecting only via https. Therefore, It would be straightforward to setup a ""webtier"" security group and efficiently limiting noise/attack traffic. We wouldn't need the ELB anyway, so we wouldn't run into its ""originating source IP problem"".  What might be the consequences? An exponential increase in latency, decrease of throughput? I'm hesitant to just go ahead and try it out, as it might look like a service abuse.

17137,Amazon EC2 V3,You've set the hostname to match the instance's public DNS name. But when you associate an Elastic IP the previous public DNS name changes to be the name corresponding with the Elastic IP.  If 174.129.7.254 is your Elastic IP then the corresponding DNS name is http://ec2-174-129-7-254.compute-1.amazonaws.com. Make sure you use URLs whose DNS point to the Elastic IP address.

Looking at the kernel configs I see quite a few differences from the default lucid configs.    A few differences I noticed were: CONFIG_PREEMPT_NONE=y added CONFIG_PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY=y removed CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS=y removed  Everything runs fine on our vanilla lucid boxes.   And we're running the Canonical lucid AMI ami-ac07f2c5    I've tried running the old kernel posted, aki-9800e5f1	,  with the higher Hz rate of 1000, but it does not seem to boot correctly in lucid.  The VM never becomes reachable.   And running a 2 year old kernel in lucid does seem like asking for problems.  (The default is 2.6.32, this being 2.6.18)  Does anyone know of a more modern kernel which might work for the lucid amis and have HIGH_RES_TIMERS enabled?   Thanks."
17129,Amazon EC2 V3,"ModifyInstanceAttribute returning InvalidParameterCombination Hi everyone,  Summary: I'm trying to set the EBS store of a t1.micro instance to not be deleted upon termination.  I have a stopped instance 'i-5e749033' and am trying to set the blockDeviceMapping attribute to /dev/sda1=::false. Unfortunately the documentation really doesn't go into the format of the value but that is what I have gathered from other sources. I have also tried the values 'vol-2ebf8147::false' and 'vol-2ebf8147:15:false' (where vol-2ebf8147 is the EBS volume).  Unfortunately EC2 is giving me an error: ""InvalidParameterCombination - No attributes specified.""  The complete output of my command line tool is here, and as you can see the attribute is sent correctly as is the value. Even if I'm doing something wrong, I think the error message is particularly bad.  * http://paste.dollyfish.net.nz/6d6456.txt  Anyone any suggestions?  Andy"
17129,Amazon EC2 V3,"You are right, the documentation is very poor on this.  You need to pass the BlockDeviceMapping parameters, which are identical to those documented in RunInstances.So something like (untested):<span class=""parameter"">BlockDeviceMapping.1.DeviceName</span>=/dev/sda1&<span class=""parameter"">BlockDeviceMapping.1.Ebs.NoDevice</span>=trueIt might be BlockDeviceMapping.1.NoDevice=true instead; try both and reply with which works."
17129,Amazon EC2 V3,"From what I can tell, I am unable to modify this for a running instance. I had to set them when I called RunInstances. In the end I ended up specifying the following:  * BlockDeviceMapping.0.DeviceName /dev/sda1  BlockDeviceMapping.0.Ebs.DeleteOnTermination false   It all seems to work fine. When I terminate the instance, the EBS store is still there which I can then delete separately.  It was all a bit roundabout to figure it out, but I got there in the end  Shame it can't be done on a running instance but that's ok, I know now."

17128,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi kennypride,Without an instance id, it's hard to say, but If it's a Windows instance, it's possible that your instance could be installing Windows updates and rebooting to apply them.  You should also check your console output (under Instance Actions in the Management Console) to see if there's any further information in there.Hope this helps!-Jason"

17127,Amazon EC2 V3,"x.509 certificates Hi,     My understanding is that these x509 certificates are necessary to execute commands like 'ec2-describe-instances' 'ec2run' ..etc. My problem is I lost the private key file(pk_xxxxx.pem) and am considering creating a new certificate. I know we are allowed to have only 2 certificates and I do have 2 already. Therefore I would have to delete an old one first so that I can create a new one. I have other .pem files to allow me to use SSH to connect to the instance. I also have a set of credentials which is required for running the ElasticFox.

17125,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi Roman,Based on the fact that you're mentioning ""ec2-user,"" it seems like you're working with the Amazon Linux AMI. That user has sudo access, by default, so you should be able to edit the files you wish to edit. Alternatively, you could switch your login shell to the root user should you choose to do so. I hope that helps. Best Regards,Scott"
17125,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi Scott,   First of all you are right: I am working with Amazon Linux AMI for EBS.  The problem is that I don't have any access to the files outside the EBS,  and I don't have the ability to switch the user.  (root is pw protected)  Thanks for trying to help but it seams like I am still stuck.  Regards. Roman"

17125,Amazon EC2 V3,"It worked thanks, really strange: why they obligate you to login with special user when you can simply switch.  Roman"
17125,Amazon EC2 V3,Roman: it's not strange at all.  It's good security practice.  Most admins will tell you that you should log in as an unprivileged user and switch to root only when necessary to run specific commands.  This way you have less chance of destroying something by accident.

17122,Amazon EC2 V3,"You are looking at filesystem sizes, not device size.  So what this actually says is:There is a filesystem on a device that has a max size of 15GB and you are about 80% used.What the command output does not say (because df only handles filesystems) is:There is 35GB more free space on the device after the end of the filesystem.You need to use a tool to resize your root filesystem if you want to use more of the 50GB space."

17121,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi George,You are correct, there isn't any instance running time to pay for when an instance is stopped.You of course do pay for the instance's related EBS volume(s) storage allocation (which allocation enables a instance to be in a stopped state).Thanks, -Philip"

17119,Amazon EC2 V3,"How should I set up a private network with a static IP?  Take a look at Virtual Private Cloud to see if it meets your needs.  Also read up on Elastic IPs.  What can  I do if I'm locked out of Windows and forgot my password?  You're out of luck for getting into the instance, so you'd have to start up a new instance.  However, if you are using EBS volumes, you can attach them to another instance to retrieve your data.  How can I access the console?  For example: win 2008 systemstate restore  You cannot get console access to Windows instances.  The AMI system should remove the need for the Windows system restore feature.  What is the support's email address? Is there a free email support?  Free support is only available through the forums.  Read up on premium support."

17117,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi GregIf you're not able to connect to SSH, you might consider taking a snapshot of the root volume (EBS) and mounting this under a new instance. You should then be able to access your log files and see if a root cause is apparent. We don't have a way to restore connectivity however the steps above should enable you to troubleshoot. The snapshot could then be used to create a new AMI, with any configuration problems corrected, and a replacement instance launched (if appropriate). I'm sorry I can't be of more assistance.

17115,Amazon EC2 V3,"does stop operation save ram contents into a volume? Hi,   When I read EC2's user guide I found this sentence ""When you stop and restart the instance (EBS backed), it launches quickly, because the state is stored in an Amazon EBS volume. "" . does this mean when stoping a vm EC2 store the memory contents of this into a volume or a vm image?Regards."
17115,Amazon EC2 V3,"No, the memory (RAM) is not saved. Stopping an instance shuts it down and only the disk contents are preserved.  Starting the instance boots it up again from that disk.  It would be cool if somebody could figure out how to hibernate a Linux EC2 instance to disk before stopping it.  You'd have to use swap on an EBS volume (perhaps even through a file on the boot disk).  -- Eric Hammond"
17115,Amazon EC2 V3,"thank you Eric Hammond.Then there is not vm image wich contains RAM contents exist in EC2? if so, why?  Because It is difficult for implementing? or It is unsafe to to that? or It needn't to do so from the perspective of a cloud user?"
17114,Amazon EC2 V3,"EBS Boot Instance showing incorrect storage for root mount Hi,We are working for one of our customers in optimizing their setup. We have setup an instance from a converted EBS backed AMI. During the imaging process we setup the root device (/dev/sda1) to be snapshotted and set the block device mapping for the root device to have 80 GB of storage.Now the volume for this instance (i-d4c9f286), Volume ID: vol-1759bb7c does show as 80 GB (in the console), but after SSH into the instance, the root volume is only 10 GB (since this instance has been converted from a S3 instance to an EBS backed instance).Moreover when I right click on the console Instances section and click Create Image (EBS AMI) I see the following bullet point.   1. dev/sda1,/dev/sdf, vol-1759bb7c,vol-6f719304 (), will not delete on terminationTotal size of EBS volumes: 0 bytesWhy is that happening. Both these volumes are attached. /dev/sda1 should be 80 GB and /dev/sdf should be 25 GB.Please provide some assistance, since I believe I have not missed anything so far.Thanks,Manish"
17114,Amazon EC2 V3,I think I have found the answer for this. It is resize2fs which needs to be executed for the /dev/sda1 volume.

17113,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hello,There're no API for file transfer, however there're some way to trasfer files to EC2 instaces.If you're using Linux, rsync over ssh might be helpful.Or, if your physical server permit http access, run wget or curl etc from instance is also available."

17111,Amazon EC2 V3,I wrote this article which might help:  http://alestic.com/2009/06/ec2-elastic-ip-internal  Note: Simply rebooting an instance will not change its internal IP address.

17110,Amazon EC2 V3,"Enabling Multiple Users to Access the Same AWS Account I am one of the founders of our company and our new AWS account is under my name.  I'd like to enable another principal in the company to have access to, or be able to take over management of, our AWS account in the event something happens to me.  If we're going to put the vast majority of our infrastructure within EC2 and pay for them using my account, I would hate to think what would happen should I get hit by a bus.  Is there anyway I can delegate a co-owner or backup-owner for our account?  If not, what's the protocol when you need to transfer management of an account?  It would also be nice to enabled a co-owner to access our account invoices since, in my case, someone else takes care of the financials of the business.   Thanks."
17110,Amazon EC2 V3,"If you give someone else the account login info (email address & password), they have full access to the account.  You might also consider using a generic company email address (aws@myco.com) and a company credit card with company billing address."
17110,Amazon EC2 V3,"Thanks for the suggestion Allen.  Unfortunately a couple things come to mind which make sharing credentials a solution to this problem, a non-starter:  1. Sharing credentials inherently requires communicating passwords, and more often than not, leads to someone writing them down (which is the first step towards someone you don't want finding them).  For other types of accounts, accounts than I wasn't betting my business on and didn't hold the keys to all of our customer's medical data, that might be a risk worth mitigating.  In this case however, I'm less than enthusiastic about taking any security shortcuts.  2. Lack of accountability.  As soon credentials start getting shared, it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to determine who took a particular course of action.  If at some point, one of the people with access to the credentials decided to cancel all of our accounts, if they did it properly, we'd have no way to prove which one of us did it.  Again, I appreciate the input, and it's something we'll consider if Amazon doesn't consider this a common scenario.  That said, with the number of organizations who have bet their business on AWS, having to choose between a single point of failure for account management and credential sharing, isn't something I imagine many people are excited about."
17110,Amazon EC2 V3,"Well, you can always do the old ""write the login credentials down and put 'em in a sealed envelope"" trick.  That should be enough to keep honest people--who share a common goal of your business's success--honest, no?Precisely how much do you distrust your business partners?"
17110,Amazon EC2 V3,"Jeez  It has nothing to do with distrusting his business partners, and that should be very obvious from the post.  Sharing passwords is bad security.At least billing should have access info different from technical if desired and tech needs to be able to see the billing as well.  Hard to believe this is ridiculed,"
17110,Amazon EC2 V3,"Thanks dchon, you're absolutely right.  This isn't about not trusting anyone, this is about doing the right thing by customers by protecting their data and their access to it.  Not to mention being prepared to be held accountable for it.    Imagine the following conversation:  Me: ""Hi, I'd like to store your very personal and valuable information (could be your SSN, financial information, pictures of your kids, your complete medical history - whatever).  We use AWS so we scale terrifically and can offer you competitive prices.""  Customer: ""Oh yeah?  AWS only allows one person to manage the virtual keys to the candy shop.  What happens if that guy dies?""  Me: ""Don't worry, we've written down that guy's password and the only other people who have access to it have promised not to look at it until pops is out on his date with the mortician.""  Customer: ""And what's to those people from jumping the gun and either destroying all of my data or simply wiping it out all together?  And if they did, how would you know who to hold accountable?""  Me: ""Did I tell you about this great new UI feature we've added?  It's called a Ribbon...""  Would you utilize a service that had the ""root"" password written down somewhere that people promised not to look?  I take it from the lack of information I've seen online and the replies I've seen so far, this isn't something AWS supports.  It's not the end of the world - AWS, like the rest of us, has to prioritize.  If someone from AWS could confirm that this is not possible and it's not in the pipeline, that would be helpful.  If you have an interest in seeing AWS support something like this, please speak up."
17110,Amazon EC2 V3,"Justin, those are very good points. We'd love to see this feature as well."
17110,Amazon EC2 V3,One way to minimize the amount that your production credentials have to be shared is to have a separate AWS account for development and production.  You can give developers your dev credentials so that they don't have access to production data.
17110,Amazon EC2 V3,"This is absolutely something that we need. It is indeed hard to believe that Amazon has not yet implemented this feature.  We need to be able to allow access to multiple people without sharing the company billing info, and without sharing a common account.  Bizarre."
17110,Amazon EC2 V3,"I am a new user of AWS and I am rather shocked that this has not been addressed, especially since it has been an issue since at least 2008 (judging by the dates on this thread).  Has anyone heard anything about this?"
17110,Amazon EC2 V3,Does the consolidated accounting mechanism help with this problem ?  Surely by now there is a way to do this ?  --Hiram
17110,Amazon EC2 V3,I can't believe this basic feature isn't offered yet. Sharing one account across a company is a really bad idea.Can someone let us know if this is a feature that's coming soon? Is there an ETA on when this feature will be available?

17103,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi joaws,Your instance is on a physical host that may be experiencing some problems.  If this is a critical production server, I'd recommend that you launch a replacement instance and move your EBS volume to the new instance.  As an aside, you may want to consider using an Elastic IP to reduce the complexity of transitioning to replacement instances:http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts-failure-resilient-apps.htmlRegards,-Jason"

17102,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi xlancelotx,If your instance is EBS-backed, you can create your image using the EC2 API Tools using ec2-create-image:http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/CommandLineReference/ApiReference-cmd-CreateImage.htmlwhich provides a --no-reboot option that you can pass.  Alternately, you could create a snapshot of the root volume, then register that snapshot as an AMI using the ec2-register command:http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/CommandLineReference/ApiReference-cmd-RegisterImage.htmlRegards,-Jason"

17101,Amazon EC2 V3,"Elastic Loadbalancer - port configuration issue We have an elastic LB with the following port config and 2 instances behind this LB:  port 80 forwarding to port 80  port 8080 forwarding to port 8080  Since port 80 was added by default during the initial loadbalancer setup, I didn't remove that and added port 8080 which is used by our applications.  httpd was running on port 80 but not used by any of our apps.  Occasionally I am seeing requests intended for port 8080 getting forwarded to port 80. Luckily I was able to work around with a temporary fix for this.

17101,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hello,Currently, we don't have any report of known issue which is similar to the one you mentioned. Also I did some quick test and checked, however I couldn't see it.It would be highly appreciate if you know how to reproduce this issue and provide us the details.Best Regards,Sachiko"

17101,Amazon EC2 V3,"One other issue I have right now- ELB is doing a constant health check every 5 seconds to port 80.  10.xxx.xxx.xxx - - [01/Oct/2010:16:14:34 -0400] ""GET /health_ping HTTP/1.1"" 200 - ""-"" ""-"" 10.xxx.xxx.xxx - - [01/Oct/2010:16:14:39 -0400] ""GET /health_ping HTTP/1.1"" 200 - ""-"" ""-"" 10.xxx.xxx.xxx - - [01/Oct/2010:16:14:44 -0400] ""GET /health_ping HTTP/1.1"" 200 - ""-"" ""-""  Though our ""Health Check"" is set for port 8080 every 30seconds.  This started to happen after the internal IP of ELB got changed.  Any clue?  thanks."
17101,Amazon EC2 V3,"Can you explain what you mean ""port 80 is blocked for the public and allowed only from the ELB""?  An ELB has a dynamically-changing set of IP addresses. If you allowed the IP address of the ELB as discovered by resolving its DNS name at a certain time, your instances will not receive any traffic once the ELB's IP address changes - which happens unpredictably, as your ELB experiences more or less traffic.  One possible explanation for the traffic you're seeing on port 80 is that the traffic is coming from an application that misused ELB and directed its traffic based on the ELB's IP address at the time. This IP address no longer belongs to his ELB - it belongs to yours. So that application's traffic is reaching your instances."
17101,Amazon EC2 V3,"Can you explain what you mean ""port 80 is blocked for the public and allowed only from the ELB""?  security group is setup to allow access to port 80 from a wide range of private IP address... so that any requests from the ELB (as src) to backend servers for p80 will be served.   I have port 80 open due to the traffic spilling intended for port 8080. wide private ip range was used to prevent issues due to ELB private IP changes.  For the ELB public address, we are using the cname record.  May be you are right... someone used the internal IP address for health checks (health_ping) and after the IP address change, I am getting those... How to prevent these type of issues?"
17101,Amazon EC2 V3,"wide private ip range was used to prevent issues due to ELB private IP changes  ELB internal IP addresses share an address range with EC2 instance internal IPs. So any EC2 instance can access your service directly.  However, this is not an issue than has a solution currently. The design of ELB  and EC2 security groups currently makes it impossible to limit the traffic on your back-end servers to originate only from the ELB. In other words: you can't limit the traffic the way you want to. Perhaps you should consider using an HAProxy or other software load balancer running on an EC2 instance.  There is also no way to prevent anyone from accessing the health check URL."
17101,Amazon EC2 V3,"apparently the request to port 80 for health_ping is coming from 10.245.215.175. This IP was tied to some other instance for which the owner of that instance had some health checks. Since our ELB got that internal IP address, the requests are coming to our ELB.   I can use iptables to block traffic from this src ip but this is only a short term solution... who knows when our ELB internal ip would change again and there will be some other constant traffic from some other src.  I wish there is an option on Security groups to block traffic based on source IP.  AWS - anyways to resolve this issue permanently?  thanks."

17099,Amazon EC2 V3,"Distributed/Load Balancing -- FileSystem Issue, NFS, PersistenFS, S3FS ??? Hello !  I have crawled this forums for a while now. We are trying to set up a Load Balanced Cloud website hosting architecture using Amazon AWS' EC2 (Using AutoScale and LoadBalancing).  Although the Database aspect seems a non-issue since we intend to use RDS which both is backup'd up and offers automatic fail-over using Multi-AZ deployment. We think the size of RDS instances would meet our needs until Amazon deploy the Read Replica feature is released.  The File System Aspect is, however, a totally different issue on its own and, afawk, does not seems solved yet. In the following are the solutions we found. It would be greatly appreciated if you could provide practical feedback on these solutions or on new ones.  Moreover, we need consistency between DB and FS: If a new DB entry link to a new file, we need the file to be available at the same time as the DB entry. Although we could abide by a few minutes delay between the user input and the actual propagation, DB and FS updates must be in sync (and obviously never fail). We prefer also this delay to be as short as possible.  1st: Distributed PersistenFS ( http://www.presistentfs.com ): One R/W host AND many R-O hosts simultaneously.  PersistentFS seems neither  to support this feature nor to intend to.   2nd: PersistentFS mounted R/W on a single EC2 instance and shared by NFS (either R-O or R/W).  This solution is not an option for us because of the NFS server which is a single point of failure. Moreover, this would imply Inter-AZ communication in the case of Multi-AZ deployment. Of course, that would be the case with the DB too but, as far as we understand, FS access generate much more data transfer than DB access (in term of data size).   3rd: S3FS ( http://code.google.com/p/s3fs/wiki/FuseOverAmazon ). Although it seems to be SID, they support Distributed Access (one R/W, many R-O simultaneously) and even Distributed R/W Access (many R/W simultaneously).  Did anyone ever tried it and would be able to provide feedback ? Any latency or desync issue ?   Afaiu, S3 does not provide neither Read-After-Update not Read-After-Delete consistency (only Eventual consistency overall and Read-After-Write consistency for us-east and eu-west regions). Does that mean that any Distributed FS solution based on S3 would imply possible desync issues ?  More importantly what is the delay implied in the ""Eventual consistency"", is it in the order of secondes ? minutes ? hours ?  Any feedback or help will help us and be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance !"
17099,Amazon EC2 V3,"Forget about using anything S3-backed that pretends to be a filesystem. S3 does not present a POSIX-compliant service and so your app will have difficulty if it uses standard file access patterns for an S3-based filesystem.  The ""eventual"" in S3's eventual consistency is typically under 2 seconds.  Take a look at GlusterFS, which is a distributed filesystem, open source, and has support available.  http://www.gluster.org/"
17099,Amazon EC2 V3,"Tanks for your answer.I have read the documentation available on GlusterFS Website, but I fail to see how I would use it.Don't hesitate to correct me if I'm wrong, but afaiu, we would need ""another"" cluster to provide the filesystem. And this cluster has to be of fixed size (e.g., no possibility to have AutoScale going on) since GlusterFS does not support easy add of a server.Basically, that would mean setting up our ""own version of S3"".I am not sure that would be an suitable solution for our needs.Ooth, could you, please, develop on the possible difficulties for S3-based FS ?Eventual consistency of 2seconds seems quite acceptable.Our file access pattern would be an occasional ""write"" with many frequent ""read"", as usual for a webserver.If I have the assurance that the filesystem consistency is achieved within a few seconds, I don't see any reason why Apache ou PHP would complain about it.I understand that S3 is not posix-compliant (although I was not able to find the precise definition of this term) but the supported subset seems enough to reach practical usability."
17099,Amazon EC2 V3,"Gluster has just released v 3.1 which allows adding nodes to the storage array without restarting the cluster. You could run Gluster on another cluster of servers, but I think it is also possible to run it within your web cluster. Gluster has pretty good read performance, but poor write performance for many small files relative to an EBS or ephemeral storage. As such I don't think it is very good for apps that generate lots of small cache files. I don't use it so I could be wrong."
17099,Amazon EC2 V3,"You're a little vague in your requirements.  Do you really need a filesystem?  Or do you just need a shared file resource.  If the latter, then i'd say store your objects in S3 and then put pointers to the S3 objects in the RDS database.  If you really need a filesystem you could use (shudder) NFS.  With autoscaling it would be possible to keep an instance attached to some EBS volumes to serve as the NFS storage master.  If the instance dies for whatever reason, auto scaling will create a new one for you.  (In this case ""scaling"" is really a misnomer - you're only scaling to one instance!  But at least there is a guarantee that that instance will always be around.)Unless the software is really out of your control, I'd go the S3 route.  If you create your bucket in US West or EU region, you get read-after-write consistency, which might serve your needs better than the eventual consistency from the US Standard region.Without knowing more about your particular requirements it's hard to be precise but hopefully this gives you some ideas."

17075,Amazon EC2 V3,name servers for my EC2 instance Sorry newbie question: What are the Amazon EC2 nameservers for my instance so that I can configure a domain to point to my EC2 addresss?
17075,Amazon EC2 V3,"you do that with your domain's nameservers, not ec2's."
17075,Amazon EC2 V3,Amazon doesn't provide DNS servers for hosting your domain's DNS.The nameservers are only for your instances to do DNS lookups.
17075,Amazon EC2 V3,Ok thanks so just high level next steps then  I have a domain registered with go daddy I have a ec2 web server up with address I can currently reach on the net it is a http://ec-174 address  What are the next steps to set the domain to the ec2 address?
17075,Amazon EC2 V3,1. Assign an elastic IP to your EC2 instance 2. Read the godaddy docs and use godaddy to assign an A-record from your domain to the elastic IP

17072,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi,First, if you are terminating your instance and launching a new one from the same AMI, your new instance will not be aware of the EBS volume that was attached to your previous instance.  If you are doing a stop (as opposed to a terminate), you should ensure that your volume remains attached to your instance (it should).  You should also make sure that Windows is properly mounting the volume to the anticipated drive letter.Finally, you should make sure that you are writing your output to the EBS volume, and not to the local ephemeral storage (which will not be retained across a stop/start).Regards,-Jason"

Everything seems to work except that I cannot get my fstab correct to mount the ephemeral0 storage and swap correctly.  I have been able to find various guides on the web (including Amazon sources) that provide ""correct"" fstab configurations, but each of these that I have tried results in needing to run fdisk on boot up and the boot process halting.  Here is my fstab for my AMI for small instances:  /dev/sda1		/		ext3	defaults 1 1 /dev/sda2		/mnt		ext3	defaults 1 2 /dev/sda3		swap		swap	defaults 0 0  When I ec2-bundle-image I have also attempted to pass the -B ""ami=sda1,root=/dev/sda1,ephemeral0=sda2,swap=sda3"" option. In all cases the boot process halts on when the machine looks to mount /dev/sda2 on /mnt.  A nudge in the right direction would be appreciated.  cheers, --Ben"
17069,Amazon EC2 V3,"If you're doing Boot From EBS, I found that you can't have the ""/mnt"" entry. I couldn't explain why exactly, but Amazon told me the ephemeral store isn't available to those instances in the normal way.  David"

17069,Amazon EC2 V3,"Fixed my own problem.Turns out that you can still have the ephemeral storage, you just have to set it up yourself, either when you create your AMI, or when you start an instance. I bundled mine up into the AMI:ec2-register --snapshot snap-5555555 --description ""AMI Description Goes Here"" --name ""ebs-centos54-x86_64-server-20100225"" --architecture x86_64 --root-device-name /dev/sda1 -b /dev/sdb=ephemeral0-b /dev/sdb=ephemeral0  does the magic here. You'll still need a line in your /etc/fstab to have it mounted automatically at boot though."
17069,Amazon EC2 V3,"Same problem. I manually mount an extra EBS volume (whether xfs or ext3, with data) at /vol and it works fine. However, I need to have it mounted automatically, so I add the following line to fstab:/dev/sdh /vol xfs noatime 0 0And then I create a new EBS image (all via the console).But when I run such image, it does not boot. It probably does not get through the fstab line.Any ideas how to change the fstab line so that it a) does not break the booting process and b) mounts the EBS volume.Thanks!"
17069,Amazon EC2 V3,The problem must have been related to the mountall problem in Ubuntu Lucid 10.04. I've fixed mountall as described at http://alestic.com/2010/09/ec2-bug-mountall and now the fstab mount of an additional EBS volume works fine.

17059,Amazon EC2 V3,"Jose,  Don't get too frustrated - the best way to handle an instance that seems to be misbehaving is to kill it and launch a replacement.   Cloud encourages you to view your CPU and memory as disposable. This view is one philosophical change that helps you write apps that can benefit from the elasticity and scalability promised by the cloud. There's little difference (architecturally) between an application that requires more instances because one of them is misbehaving, and between an application that requires more resources because the current resources are insufficient to meet the demand.  Cloud infrastructure is made from commodity hardware, which has reasonable - though not great - failure rates. Reliability beyond the AWS SLA requires that your application be written to accomodate cloud infrastructure failure."

Attaching an Elastic IP removes the prior public IP address from the instance, which is where the SSH or RDP session is connected to. You need to re-establish your SSH/RDP connection to the instance, using the Elastic IP address (either by DNS name or by actual numerical address) again after assigning the Elastic IP. Usually it takes around a minute for the new Elastic IP address to actually be associated with the instance - so there might be a slight delay in establishing the new session."

There does not seem to be a way to get rid of it. The snapshot that referred to it is also deleted, and the AMI that I had created with that snapshot also unregistered. All these were done 10 days ago.   I searched the forums, and there are a large number of such cases, and it seems that each time, someone from AWS has to step in and erase the volume. I definitely need this help as well, as no command seems to get the job done.  Is there any way to prevent this from happening? Is there any other procedure that should be followed? I've found the EC2 quite sophisticated so far, and I am a very happy user, and I cannot believe that there is no way to fix this myself.   Christos Aposkitis"

Hi,  I am running instance i-9bc0ddf1 with an Elastic IP.  Every few days I find that I need to reboot the instance or else I just get a blank page (Mozilla) or error message (Safari).  After that, it's all good again.  Why is it necessary to keep rebooting my instance?  Is there a configuration I can check to stop this?  Thank you!"
17051,Amazon EC2 V3,It probably has to do with a software-level configuration of your OS or webserver and not EC2. You ought to look through your logs and try to identify the root cause.
17051,Amazon EC2 V3,Hrmmm...this is problematic...I am using an AMI released by a third party specifically for running a type of repository software on Debian Linux - nothing else.  Unfortunately...I cannot seem to locate a log file in any of the usual places...

17050,Amazon EC2 V3,"Sorry for the repeated submissions, please some admin remove the duplicated posts. Thanks"
17050,Amazon EC2 V3,"Thank you for asking about the kernel security vulnerability. The specific vulnerability was patched on 2010-09-18.We release kernel-2.6.34.6-54.24 to the Amazon Linux AMI repositories, as well as release Amazon Linux AMI 0.9.8-beta. For more information please see:http://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/"
17050,Amazon EC2 V3,In addition to the existing fix for the Amazon Linux AMI we are also evaluating the impact of this vulnerability on existing AKIs that are available inside of EC2.  This post will be updated as more information is available.  Additional information will also be made available in the AWS Security Center here:  http://aws.amazon.com/security/security-bulletins/It is important to note that this vulnerability corresponds to a local privilege escalation within a running instance.  That means that a user or process must already have access to the system to escalate to root privileges. One immediate mitigation available to all AMI builders is the use of PV-GRUB to enable a kernel to be loaded directly from the AMI. With this method it is then possible to update the kernel in the AMI to a version that is not impacted by this vulnerability. AMI builders will have to check with the Linux distributor to ensure that the kernel they install through this method is not impacted by this vulnerability.  The process of using PV-GRUB inside of EC2 is described in more detail here:http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=3967&categoryID=174

17046,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi there If your volumes are still in stuck in a detaching state you can use the EC2 command line tool ""ec2-detach volume-id --force"" to dismount them from your instance. If you do not have the EC2 tools installed you could alternatively install the ElasticFox (Firefox) plugin that will allow you to also to detach drives stuck in a detaching state.I had a look at your instance i-a99c92c3 and the underlying hard ware looks good. I think you must have had something go wrong at the application/OS level to effect your access to this instance.When you re-attach your drives to a replacement instance I would suggest examining any logs for a potential cause for your inaccessibility."
17046,Amazon EC2 V3,"Thanks Jason,  The force option is definitely a good option for next time around. Thanks for pointing that out. Luckily, we were able to build a new master database from an up-to-date replicated slave.  I'm still a little confused as to why the instance took an hour to terminate. I suppose if there were something wrong at the OS/Kernel level, than the init process may not be able to shut down everything properly and could have been hanging on one of its child processes. Anyway, my speculation isn't helpful but I would like to know this: Is there a timeout on the termination process, whereby an instance is issued a ""hard"" shutdown regardless of the state of its guest OS?

I should have mentioned this...

BUT I found a page ( <a class=""jive-link-external"" href=""http://blogs.sun.com/alanb/entry/jstack"">http://blogs.sun.com/alanb/entry/jstack</a> ) stating that ""jstack isn't the only way to obtain a thread dump of a running application. Developers have long been accustomed to using Ctrl-\ (or Ctrl-Break if you are on Windows) to get a thread dump of an application that is running interactively. An alternative to the key sequence on Solaris (or Linux) is to send a QUIT signal to the target process. In that case the target processs prints a thread dump to its standard output (which can be pain if you don't know where the log file is).""<br class=""jive-newline"" /> <br class=""jive-newline"" /> After reading this I sent the QUIT signal to the hung Java process running ec2-describe-instances and I captured the output hoping it might help troubleshoot the problem. Unfortunately the output is way over my Java knowledge level so I attach here 2 files: one was generated using openjdk-1.6.0.0.out (the stock jre on CentOS 5.5) and the other was generated using jre1.6.0_21 (just downloaded from java.com).<br class=""jive-newline"" /> <br class=""jive-newline"" /> Please let me know if this helps or if I can provide any other information to help.<br class=""jive-newline"" /> <br class=""jive-newline"" /> Thanks a lot!                 </div>                                  </div>                 </td>             </tr>         </table>                     </td>     </tr>      </table>  </td></tr></table> </div>                </div>         </div>                    <div class=""jive-message-list"">             <div class=""jive-table"">                       <div class=""jive-messagebox"">  <table summary=""Message"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" border=""0""     width=""100%"">     <tr id=""jive-message-197818"" valign=""top"">         <td class=""jive-first"" valign=""top"">           <table class=""jive-thread-messagebox"" style=""padding: 12px;"" width=""100%"">             <tr>                                  <td valign=""top"" width=""1%""></td>          <td width=""100%"" valign=""top"">         <span class=""jive-subject""> <a             name=""197818""></a> Re: AWS API/AMI CLI tools take way too much time to run        </span>                   <div style=""padding-top: 5px;

17034,Amazon EC2 V3,"Windows Instance System Clock:  All failing today EC2 Windows instances have always had an issue where every once in a while a box would come up with the wrong time set, forcing you to manually sync it before you did anything.  Today though, EVERY SINGLE instance I've started has the clock shifted 8 hours forward, and they are all failing to sync to any of the available internet time services.  The only workaround I've found (after finding them in a 5-minute sync/fail/sleep cycle for 6 hours) is to connect to each box via remote desktop and manually change the time.  Has something changed today?  Are you aware that boxes are failing in this way?  Here is a list of instances that exhibit this problem.

17033,Amazon EC2 V3,"Win2k8 instance i-c12514ab fails to start It had been working up until the last day or so.  first notice of the problem was when i was stopping all my instances, it took a very long time in pending state.  then the next day when i went to start them up, this instance goes to pending, and then back to stopped.  no error or debugging information that i can see on my end.  Last work i had done was attaching a new volume to it.  copying some data, and detaching the volume to attach to a different instance.I tried re-attaching the volume, no difference.  I also tried taking a snapshot of the root volume, and bringing up a new instance with this attached.  the instance comes up, but it's not booting off the snapshot volume as it's root, so i havent effectively restored the machine.any help would be greatly appreciated.   I'm trying to start the same instance up now, and it's stuck in pending mode (and likely to go back to stopped). Thanks!"
17033,Amazon EC2 V3,could someone from amazon take a look at this?  I spent several hours on this machine's configuration before it mysteriously stopped working.
17033,Amazon EC2 V3,"We  have Amazon Premium Support and the same issues. We reboot an instance, it comes up fine. But Stop it, then start it up again and it fails. Nothing in their logs and the Premium support in this case is useless. They wouldn't touch it.It is obviously a problem with their EC2CONFIG service, Windows instances. For some reason when the instance gets stopped, and started back up, their EC2CONFIG service does something to it that makes it fail to respond to RDP or any other request. The instance responds to PING, but nothing more.I'm looking now at completely disabling their EC2CONFIG service. It is just problematic and their whole Windows offering is buggy at best."
17033,Amazon EC2 V3,thanks for the suggestions.  I'd disable the ec2config service if i could get access to the box.  sorta a catch 22 for me.anyone else have any ideas?

17032,Amazon EC2 V3,"ec2-modify-instance-attribute t1.micro to m1.large fails to start In my attempt to set up a new server, I created a micro instance to prepare the server and now attempted to adjust it to a large instance.  The server was started using ami-f51ff09 as Win2003 64 bit base..  The server is stopped when I run:    ec2-modify-instance-attribute i-b822ccd5 -t m1.large  The AWS console shows m1.large instance and I attempt to start the server. It, however, fails to start with the reason:    State Transition Reason: Server.InternalError: Internal error on launch  The forums seem to confirm other users having successfully switched between instance types, yet I'm unsure if the failing to start perhaps this is Windows specific? Does anybody have ideas on why this fails to start after changing types?"
17031,Amazon EC2 V3,"Elastic Load Balancing sticky session Hi,I'd like to ask you a Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) question.Is it possible to make cookie by ELB ?I read following site. And I found ""load balancer-generated cookie"".http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/index.html?SvcIntro.html<span class=""bold""></span>I think ""load balancer-generated cookie"" means that ELB makes cookie.If so, for example, it is not necessary to set jvmRoute in Tomcat server.xml.Is it correct ?Thanks and regards,Kenji"
17031,Amazon EC2 V3,"ELB relies on cookies only for sticky sessions. If you haven't set up sticky sessions then ELB does not use cookies.  The ELB session stickiness cookie controls the duration of the stickiness: after the cookie expires, the stickiness association will expire. There are two choices for controlling the session stickiness duration:  - set it to a specific timeout period. This is done using a cookie provided by the ELB.  set it to follow the lifetime of an application cookie.   If you set your ELB to have its own cookie then you do not need to use a cookie from your application for stickiness. However, your application's cookie is the only way your application can ""remember"" the browser session. You probably don't want to remove the application cookie.  Check out my article offerring an explanation of sticky sessions in general and EC2's ELB stickiness feature: http://www.shlomoswidler.com/2010/04/elastic-load-balancing-with-sticky-sessions.html"

17030,Amazon EC2 V3,MySQL DB on a separate instance... how to achieve the best connection? We are doing some testing on Amazon with an m2.4xlarge instance as a MySQL db server for a cluster of small webservers.  I´m a little worried by the latency (our tests stress that we lose a 20% of requests per second when serving from localhost vs the m2.4xlarge instance).  Currently we have the webservers connecting to the db instance through an internal dns record. Is this the best setup?  Thanks in advance!  Message was edited by: Simon Mu??oz Marin
17029,Amazon EC2 V3,"What exactly does ""as-terminate-instance-in-auto-scaling-group"" do? I have been using EC2 for a long time but am a relative newcomer to the Auto Scaling system. After having read the docs carefully, I cannot see anything which the ""as-terminate-instance-in-auto-scaling-group"" does differently from the ""old fashioned"" way of terminating an instance (from the command line or from the EC2 console).Is there in fact any behavior at all in this utility (as-terminate....) which is unique to the tool and not something I can get from the standard console? Can anyone please explain why I would ever use it?Thank you."
17029,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hey Bryan,Autoscaling manages two additional aspects in addition to what happens with standard RunInstances calls.1) If there is one or more Elastic Load Balancers configured for the group, Autoscaling takes care of adding and removing your instances from those load balancers for you.  In this case, TerminateInstanceInAutoScaling group cleans those instances out of the load balancer for you.2) The metrics coming from instances within an Autoscaling group get an addtional ""AutoScalingGroup"" metric dimension attached to them, that way you can ask ""What is the aggregate CPU Utilization within this group"".  When autoscaling terminates an instance, it cleans up this information as well.  However, since the instance would be shut down and not emitting metrics, you probably wouldn't notice.In addition to coordinating with other services, Autoscaling also maintains a detailed audit trail of all launches and terminates which occur within your group.  So calling TerminateInstanceInAutoScalingGroup will leave behind a long lived activity in your audit trail (available via the DescribeScalingActivities API).  A terminate via the normal TerminateInstances API does not leave behind an audit trail item.What probably confuses the matter is that Autoscaling monitors the state of instances contained within a group.  So if you called TerminateInstance on an Autoscaling managed instance, shortly after that instance terminates, Autoscaling will detect the ""out of band"" instance termination, and will create a new Terminate scaling activity which will go ahead and clean up the load balancer and monitoring configuration for you while also adding an item to your audit trail of when the system detected the terminated instance and cleaned up after it.I hope that helps, let us know if you have any other questions.-Geoff"
17029,Amazon EC2 V3,"Geoff,Thank you for the detailed reply. Your first two points make sense in terms of explaining the differences. However, your final paragraph throws it all together again, and makes me think there is no net difference at all. Thus your answer really isn't helpful, because, I still cannot complete the following sentence:""I need to terminate an instance in an auto-scaling group. I had better remember to use the tool as-terminate-instance-in-auto-scaling-group, because if I don't, then X will happen.""Can you succinctly explain what ""X"" would be?Thank you,Bryan"

17022,Amazon EC2 V3,"incorrect private dns name from ec2-describe-instances for EBS instance Hi,  I'm aware that when stopping and then starting an EBS instance that the public/private ips/dns names all change.   However, I'm noticing that when I stop/start an EBS instance the private dns names reported from ec2-describe-instances are incorrect compared to logging into the nodes and running 'hostname' on them. All other data seems to be correct (public/private ips and public dns name). It's as if the old private dns names are sticking around some how in the DescribeInstances response.

17015,Amazon EC2 V3,"How do you automate failover on EC2? Of the folks managing their own clusters (i.e. not using/paying for Amazon Autoscale, Rightscale, Scalr, etc.), how are you managing your instances on EC2 and handling (e.g.) failover? I'm wondering if most folks just end up writing their own boatloads of scripts against the EC2 API, as I suspect.  That's certainly our approach: whip up our own Python Boto-based monitoring/restarting daemon that runs off-site, listening for UDP keep-alives from our instances. On failure, we snapshot volumes, register images, start new instances, delete old volumes, and so on.  Every so often, when hacking on our scripts, I think there must be some open-source tools out there that deal with these issues already, and which don't have the constraints of (say) Scalr, but I always come back from Google empty-handed. (Things like Scalr have are pretty limited in the supported set/versions/configurations of software, and have specialized and IMO cumbersome ways of manipulating these setups.)  Also, the Linux-HA/Pacemaker ecosystem (Heartbeat, ldirectord, etc.) sounds like it isn't really suited for EC2 [1]. (But then I found [2] - though I'm not sure this is really a high-quality solution).  [1] http://serverfault.com/questions/186826/do-pacemaker-heartbeat-etc-make-sense-for-ec2 [2] http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/thread.jspa?messageID=195373"
17015,Amazon EC2 V3,The requirements here tend to be pretty custom which is probably why it's hard to find a pre-built solution. Let us know if you find something awesome
17015,Amazon EC2 V3,"My question for you, Yang, would be - what is it that you want to do that AutoScaling/ELB can't do?  Perhaps submitting it as a feature request to AWS would let everybody reap the benefits.I'm using autoscaling/ELB and it's fine, but my needs are relatively simple."
17015,Amazon EC2 V3,"I'm sure Autoscaling serves its purpose nicely and simply - controlling the number of instances based on various monitored signals. We have a relatively straightforward implementation of most of the same feature set implemented via a boto daemon. While our scripts are pretty specialized for our own use, they don't have to be - if we ever find the time we'd love to throw it up on github. This was just one of the simpler things that we surprisingly never found floating around.  For us, automating failover includes other things as well. When (for instance) our database primary goes down, we perform shared-disk failover, by reattaching the DB volume to another surviving instance, while we recover the terminated instance by building an image out of its EBS volume and instantiating it, while retaining snapshots for backup. We use replication, but since the major databases only support asynchronous replication, we avoid failing over to those to avoid losing data, and only use them for backup and spreading the read load.  Again, I think dafaleiting was basically right - a lot of the meatier, hairier things are probably simply too specialized to make general. And certain problems may be made easier via better underlying distributed systems. I just thought I'd solicit others' thoughts here."
17015,Amazon EC2 V3,Chef and Puppet are two open-source frameworks that provide the ability to do exactly that. There are even scripts/recipes/actions/verbs available for those frameworks to handle common operational scenarios (e.g. failover of a MySQL master).  http://www.opscode.com/chef/ http://www.puppetlabs.com/
17015,Amazon EC2 V3,"My experiences with those tools have been less than stellar. The scripts may not work if I'm not using an expected version of the software - happens frequently. And for any automation operations that are not supported out of the box by one of their scripts (also frequent), you're on your own, except now you have to additionally deal with Puppet or Chef. Finally, for system configuration, I find it much easier to just go in and munge things by hand, then clone the VM."

17003,Amazon EC2 V3,You could use tags.  See the docs: http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/index.html?Using_Tags.html
17003,Amazon EC2 V3,Thanks. That was just what I needed. The API is documented here: http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/ApiReference_query_CreateTags.html  Message was edited by: theoriginaljgaa

17002,Amazon EC2 V3,Well...there's lots of places with information:  An overview: http://aws.amazon.com/windows/  Tons of docs here: http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ec2/  Specific information on connecting to a Windows instance with RDP: http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/  And remember...this is CHEAP.  Just spin up an instance and try some things.  You'll figure it out really quickly.

16999,Amazon EC2 V3,"Check other regions in the AWS Management Console. Perhaps you're running an instance in a region you aren't looking at currently.  Only EBS-backed instances can be Stopped. You're probably running an instance-store instance, which cannot be Stopped, only Terminated."
16998,Amazon EC2 V3,"two elb questions: TCP PING FINS?  and  2 ELB->1 INSTANCE? Hi folks, I have two questions about elb:1. If the health check is tcp, the load balancer opens a tcp socket to the ec2 instance at the port, and if it succeeds, then the instance is healthy (subject to threshholds of course). My question: if it succeeds in opening the tcp socket, it immediately closes it with the proper termination protocol, issuing FIN, waiting for ACK, etc to the instance side, right?2. From reading some other discussion threads, it seems like it is possible to have two load balancers that, for example, route to two different processes (different ports) that are running on the same ec2 instance. Is this true? The AWS Management Console doesn't seem to allow this when setting up an ELB - why is that?thanks!Colin  changed subject   Message was edited by: thecolinator"
16998,Amazon EC2 V3,"I don't know offhand about #1, but if you test it please share your results.  #2, it is possible to create a single ELB that has multiple listeners, as long as each listener port (the port facing the web) is different - the instance-ports (the port to which the traffic is sent on the instance) can be the same or different between the multiple listeners. It is also possible to create multiple ELBs with the same instances in them - in this case you can selectively split the traffic on a single incoming port into separate instance ports. You can do this with the command-line utilities. Here is an article showing how (and why it might be useful): http://shlomoswidler.com/2009/07/ec2-instance-belonging-to-multiple-elbs.html"

If you can curl from inside....but you can't curl from outside....then something is blocking the traffic.  Haven't used nix in a very long time so I don't know the process for ""opening"" ports.  Even WinXP has a basic firewall...but from all we've exchanged,  I'm really suspecting there is a software firewall at work here.  Hope that helps."

16986,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi - actually EC2 is just the service name. You first need to let people know if you've started up a Windows or Linux machine image as the steps are OS dependent.From the way you asked the question, I'm guessing you're running a local Windows machine and want to get into your EC2 instance (either command line or desktop)Typical instructions for a Windows instance including getting the ""Administrator"" account password and logging in using remote desktop :http://www.michaelckennedy.net/blog/2010/01/31/BuildingWindowsMachinesInAmazonEC2.aspxFor a linux instance, you're not going to see any desktop in the images I've seen - command line access it de-rigeur, and 'm not aware of anything running X windows in a useful way.http://cloudcarpenters.com/blog/ec2_putty/ is one place to look, then run the Elasticfox firefox browser extension : http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=609Once Elasticfox is setup and you can see your running Ec2 machine, click Tools. On windows, SSH command should point to a program you'll download called ""PuTTY"" (ignore the schonky looing website, it does what it says on the tin) : http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.htmlWhen that's installed, first change the SSH Command line - in my case, that's C:\Applications\PuTTY\putty.exeYou then need the SSH Key / EC2 key pairs which will encrypt login between your PC and the remote instance (there's no need to login as ""root"" as the key pair negotiation takes care of that)This is where it gets a little fiddly - take a look at the cloudcarpenters blog above, and this video :http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=583&categoryID=100The first few times I did this it took a whlie to click so don't be put off and do a little more research if you get stuck.HTHCheers - Neil"

If the message does not appear after a long period of time (for example, 30 minutes), Amazon is experiencing a problem starting the instance. Consider terminating the instance and launching a new one.  About 5 minutes after ""Windows is ready to use"" appears in the system log, open All Programs > Accessories > Remote Desktop Connection. In the Computer text box, enter the public DNS name that you copied or wrote down previously and click Connect. Choose to connect using the Administrator account. Type the administrator password you retrieved earlier in these steps.  from here: http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisserver/10.0/help/arcgis_server_on_amazon_ec2/index.html#//00rq0000000m000000.htm"
16984,Amazon EC2 V3,How to create AMI from EBS volume? So I have an instance running all nice and proper.  I want to create an AMI from its root volume (EBS).  So I did this:ec2-stop-instances i-5f228e1bec2-create-snapshot -d 'my new server' vol-6d6a1e06ec2-register -s snap-112bfa7a -n newservertestec2-run-instances -t t1.micro -k mykey -g mygroup ami-6e1b4b2bthe instance starts ok but there's no console output and i can't connect to it.  clearly something failed when it was initializing.  how can i find out what happened?
16984,Amazon EC2 V3,"Was the ""nice and proper"" instance running on a t1.micro?  If not, then there may be issues with ephemeral storage when trying to use the micro instance type."
16983,Amazon EC2 V3,Servers becoming unreachable after reboot I have three EC2 servers in the us-east-1 region that become unreachable after reboot. AMI ID is ami-261fea4f. Provider ID's are:i-978e94fdi-bbeff5d1i-95e1fbffHow do I get more information about what is failing during server start?
16983,Amazon EC2 V3,Check the console log?
16982,Amazon EC2 V3,"Security group for instance (default ) not filtering I have a running instance which uses the default security group. My setup is simple: one instance using the default security group. My default security group has only 3 rules in it: ALL tcp from any instance in the group, ALL udp from any instance in the group and ALL from anywhere to port 80. That's it!  Yet, I can SSH to the machine as well as access other services. In other words, the default security group is NOT filtering!  I don't think that there is a way to change the ""default deny"" behavior of the security group, right?  Any ideas? It has always worked in the past. I rebooted the instance and still. I have confirmed from the instance itself using ec2-describe-group  that it is using the default security group -- it is the only group that i have! TIA."
16982,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi ffdev,Can you please provide your instance ID so that we can investigate this issue further?  It would also be helpful to know the timestamps (including timezone) that you accessed the instance successfully over a port and protocol that you believe should have been blocked.Thanks,-Cindy"
16982,Amazon EC2 V3,Thanks Cindy. My instance id is i-89df20e3  I accessed the machine on Thu Oct  7 10:04:57 EDT 2010 (just a few seconds ago) on a port that should have been blocked.  Thanks for your assistance!
16982,Amazon EC2 V3,"We have finished the investigation and identified the cause.  An isolated manual operation mistake impacted the rules for this particular instance.  The problem is now corrected.  Please let us know if you see any more issues.Thanks,-Steve"
16982,Amazon EC2 V3,"Thank you for your quick responses.  Was the ""isolated manual operation"" done for another instance or mine?  I'd like a little bit more information if possible about why this was done and at whose request.  Also, when was this done? For how long was my machine without the firewall? Please feel free to email me privately. Thanks again for your quick responses -- it is working fine now."
16982,Amazon EC2 V3,I'm curious about what happened too.
16981,Amazon EC2 V3,"Unable to connect (web/ssh/ping) to running instance Hi,I have a running instance in asia pacific region which unable to connect recently.

16981,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi AWS,  Any help can offer? We have lost production service for a day! Is it network issue? Shall I need to reboot?  Thanks for any help!"
16981,Amazon EC2 V3,We have been down for over 24 hrs but Amazon still didn'r respond or reply. This is a production site for customer access.
16981,Amazon EC2 V3,"Amazon folks are pretty good about responding on the forums, but if this is critical you may want to look into paid support."
16981,Amazon EC2 V3,"Doug, Thanks for your recommendations. We just subscrive the premium support service and the problem solve within an hour."
16981,Amazon EC2 V3,"Just out of interested. I have had two similar problems during the last 7 days. Did they explain what was the problem or just recovered your instance? Does this mean that it is good idea to buy their premium support is you are running a business critical system in EC2?Regards,Olli"
16981,Amazon EC2 V3,"That's great!  We haven't used the paid support yet, but I'm glad to hear it works."
16980,Amazon EC2 V3,"IP Security Policies locked my out of my win server 2003 instance I was trying to block an IP which have been attacking my server and I accidently assign the Secure Server policy (the one that says ""For all IP traffic, always require security using Kerberos trust."") and since then all my web pages went down and all my accesses to the server are completly block, of course, including RDC. Is there a way to unassign that policy? or any other way to connect to the server   This is really urgent and I would really appreciate any help.  Thanks in advance"
16980,Amazon EC2 V3,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""accidently assign the Secure Server policy"".  Are you doing this from AWS Console...via an AWS API...or is this via the OS?    If this is via the OS, I'm not sure what could be done.  Don't panic though...I'm not a network admin kinda guy, so maybe someone else could help.  Which OS and version are you using?"
16980,Amazon EC2 V3,"There are several ways to lock yourself out of a running instance.  Once you do so, your only recovery is to launch a new instance.  If your current instance is EBS-backed, you could recover your data by attaching the volumes to a new instance.  I don't know much about Kerberos trust, but it seems that if you could figure out how to remote desktop using Kerberos trust, then you might be able to get into your instance."
16980,Amazon EC2 V3,"Yes Doug, I accidently assigned a default IPSec from the IP Security Policies Manager on a RDC connection with the server. Such a newbie error.  I'm using Win Server 2003"
16980,Amazon EC2 V3,"As I understand of what I've investigated, to use Kerberos trust on that server I had to set it up before I accidently assign those default policies. So, that probably won't work."
16980,Amazon EC2 V3,Erg.  I think you're stuck then.    At least it's easy to spin up a new instance.

16977,Amazon EC2 V3,"Historical data on EC2 availability? Is there any historical data available on the nature of EC2's availability? Most of what's out there is anecdotal. I'd be interested in anything available (either from Amazon or collected by third parties), but some example high-level questions:  - What are the nature of EC2 instance failures, and how often do they occur? How independent or correlated are failures (e.g. mostly rack-level)? Does EC2 intentionally cluster together machines run by the same user or which communicate among each other onto the same rack? Are the failures mostly due to power failures, or Amazon maintenance, or something else?  - What kind of network partitions have occurred, and how frequently do they happen? Of the non-trivial network partitions (which include single node partitions), what shape do they take (including Internet reachability) and how long do they take to repair?  - How frequently do availability zone failures/outages occur?  - What about EC2 API availability? And how often are they inconsistent with the state of the actual instances?  I realize that I might not get answers to many of these questions, but anything would be super-useful in helping us plan and prioritize in developing a reliable application on EC2. Thanks."
16977,Amazon EC2 V3,"+1. Pretty sure we are not going to get this from AWS, but would be wonderful if they provide at least some info."
16977,Amazon EC2 V3,"Unfortunately the only historical data goes back about a month on the dashboard  http://status.aws.amazon.com/  I've been running a service on EC2 for over a year with a handful of instances, and only experienced once instance death in that time due to hardware failure in the underlying host. There have been two or three notable outages, power/network related, that have lasted on the order of a few hours and impacted single availability zones (my instances happened not to be affected by any of these outages).   There have also been two or three API outages of several hours that, while not interfering directly with the operation of existing resources, impact things like the ability to create EBS snapshots etc.  It is possible to dig up forum threads about these specific instances but not easy. I guess the summary answer is that I've never seen the entire service go down, but there are a few times a year that something affects a percentage of EC2 instances over a period of a couple hours. If you are able to distribute your service among zones and are quick at responding, you can probably minimize your exposure to these incidents."
16976,Amazon EC2 V3,"After creating a new EBS volume, it is much slower than the rest? Hi all, In an effort to increase the size of a volume from 200GB to 500GB I created a new EBS volume of 500GB and attached it to an instance.This was mounted by Windows as my F drive. It is all formatted and ready to go.  My current E drive (200GB) had all it's contents copied over to the newly created F drive (500GB). I then detached both drives, making sure that all services and applications using the partitions have been shut down. Then I re-attached the 500GB drive and named it as my E drive. All services were then started up and everything works...except the performance. It is very very slow. Assume that this is because all new EBS volumes are first created on slower physical disks and then are switched over to faster disks as I/O increases? Or is this just me clutching at straws? The slow down in performance is very noticeable. Previous transactions would take sub second. Maps and images would zip back. Now with the larger volume, it takes several seconds. Have any seen something similar and have we done something wrong? Thanks in advance. Ming"

16971,Amazon EC2 V3,1. assign an elastic ip to your dc instance 2. install dns role on the dc3. set the member instance to use the dc's elastc ip as the dns server4. join the domain
16971,Amazon EC2 V3,Thanks Vlad.   That is how it was setup however it appeared to be the security group that was causing the problem (blocking certain ports?). Do you know of an example security group that will maintain a degree of security whilst allowing AD traffic?
16970,Amazon EC2 V3,Instance Unavailable While investigating slow system response time on Sept. 27 about midday eastern time we found instance i-63419b09 unavailable. Over three hours we timed out trying to ssh into it. We rebooted it several times and the console reported it available. We were even receiving Big Brother messages from it but we could not connect to it. We decided to create a new instance though our most recent AMI was two months old. That unfortunately created other issues. At the time it did not occur to me to check the Service Health Dashboard. What happened to the instance and why did it suddenly become available later in the day? I have not dropped the instance yet in case you need it to investigate. Thank you.

Reboot from the admin panel makes no difference.Regards,Olli"
16969,Amazon EC2 V3,Definitely not normal.  I've had an instance running for over a year without problems.  Not surprising that the instance wouldn't respond to a ping.  I believe the AWS firewall (see Security Groups in the Control Panel) blocks pings by default.   Did your instance respond to pings before?  Have you been successful in creating and attaching to your instances via SSH or Remote Desktop?
16969,Amazon EC2 V3,"Yeah these are Ubuntu instances created based on the official Ubuntu images. The first one ran ok for couple of months and then suddenly died last week. The new one created ran for about a week and then died yesterday. Before they die everything works fine and I can access them remotely. When I get the problem the instance is no longer accessible over SSH and reboot does not make any difference. Also, the log file in the admin console does not refresh (I think).

If I start a second instance in the same az and of same size, it will be paid as usual (On-Demand).

16965,Amazon EC2 V3,"EBS volumne disconnected without warning or user intervention Hi,I was wondering if anyone else had any EBS volume detach last night without warning. We have a 32-bit linux instance i-79370313 with EBS volume vol-22583f4b attached. Last night at approx 18:34 UTC the EBS volume seemed to detach without any user interaction. When looking for the mount on the root of the file system it wasn't present and data couldn't be accessed - the system said the path wasn't present. When we used Elastic Fox to reboot the server the volume could then be the EBS volume had to be reattached using the ec2-attach-volume command.I have been through the system logs and I can't see any messages about the detachment.However the thing that is confusing is attach time is showing as 2010-09-18 06:13:41 in Elastic Fox which is not yesterday.So I have two questions:1. Why did my EBS volume detach without any user interaction?2. Why is the attach time still showing as September?If anyone can shed some light on those things that would be great.ThanksNick"
16965,Amazon EC2 V3,"Nick, I reviewed this volume and can confirm that our internal logs show the same events as being reported by elastic fox. The last time the volume was attached was on 09/17 20:13 GMT. The volume's cloudwatch graphs show that volume has write activity on a consistent basis. I also don't see any records of the volume being (re) attached yesterday. I do see 2 API calls that were made to attach these volumes. Both these calls were returned (correctly) with client errors stating that the volume vol-22583f4b was already attached to an instance.Please let me know if you have any further questions.Thanks,Sachin"

Anyway, my auto scaling is running normally and I believe the CloudWatch data can be collected normally. It just can't be displayed properly in the AWS Management Console."
16964,Amazon EC2 V3,We also have more than one instance and all its cloudwatch monitoring details shows broken lines. We noticed it since June 30 (GMT +8:00). We thought that it is just our instances that are causing the problem so we created  new instances but still we have been experiencing broken graphs in the cloudwatch monitoring details. We are also experiencing intermittent web access from our server.
16964,Amazon EC2 V3,"Any updates on the erratic behavior of our instance.  We have created new instances, and the problem seems to be the same.  If you can check out one of our instance (i-73c52218).  If you check our cloudwatch monitoring for the instance i have mentioned, you will notice that it is intermittent.  Our instances are located in us-east-1b.  I hope you can check what our issue is, as it has been behaving erratically for more that a week now.  Thanks"
16964,Amazon EC2 V3,I am experiencing the same thing - broken lines in Cloudwatch and intermittent very high EBS latency which causes my instance to freeze for 3-5 minutes at a time!
16964,Amazon EC2 V3,on october 4 cloudwatch stopped working on my rds instance. in the aws management console the graphs show data before october 4. now it's all blank.  how can i get cloudwatch to collect data again? preferably without creating a new instance and trashing the old one.  your response is very much appreciated.

16962,Amazon EC2 V3,"Strange Billing Discrepancy? We have an unusual discrepancy for EBS Storage Costs.

16962,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi, traffckr,I attempted to review your usage reports, but it appears the AWS account associated with your forum nickname is not the same account that uses EBS volumes in your attached screen captures.The short answer is that the missing part is the metering model used to calculate EBS storage charges.The entries on your usage report are listed in byte-hours, and that total needs to be converted to GB-Mo to match what appears on your Account Activity page:58776309534860 byte-hours / 1024^3 bytes/GB = 54739.7039 GB-hours54739.7039 GB-hours / 24 hours/day / 30 days/September = 76.027 GB-Mo.Unfortunately, without the AWS Account ID or the e-mail address associated with the account with this usage, I'm not able to investigate why this doesn't exactly match the amount on your billing statement: 75.871 GB-Mo.The discrepancy may be related to a rounding difference, but I'd like to look into this further. If you can send me a PM with the account ID for this account, I'll figure out what caused the difference.Also, let me know if you have additional questions.Best regards,Matthew P."
16962,Amazon EC2 V3,"Matthew  Thank-you for your explanation, it accounts exactly for the discrepancy. I don't have the spreadsheet I took the screencap from earlier any more but when I add the values up manually they also come to exactly the right number too.  M."

16958,Amazon EC2 V3,"Thanks Paul, I discovered elasticfox last night. As you said, trying to start instances via elasticfox returns proper error messages.  It reported that my account had been blocked for some reason. It didn't say why. I'd already double-checked my billing details to make sure nothing had gone wrong there.  I emailed support straight away, a couple of hours later my account was active again, and several hours after that I heard back from support saying they weren't sure what the problem was because my ""account is active and has not been blocked"". Sure, not now, but it was for the whole afternoon, guys…  Then, I hit the issue you described with insufficient capacity in us-east-1a, which is where my EBS is. I got around that by snapshotting it and creating a new volume from the snapshot in -1b. I have a rake task uploading the assets it contains (~200GB) into Rackspace Cloud Files now.  Once that's finished, I'm done with AWS. Things go wrong for seemingly no reason, when they do it's detective work to find out what actually happened, and the support team is essentially behind a paywall. Seeya, Amazon   Thanks again for your reply Paul, good to hear more details about us-east-1a, and that I wasn't the only one having problems with the web console."
16958,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi Cindy,  After my account was unblocked, I launched instances without any trouble in us-east-1b. -1a consistently reported there was no space for new instances. Once I discovered I could migrate the EBS by snapshotting and re-creating in -1b, I had no further problems.  As I said, I was launching alestic/ubuntu instances. Not on-demand or anything. None of that was the problem though; it was first that my account was blocked, and later that -1a was full. (The web console didn't tell me any of that, though.)  I'm running on a -1b instance now, to extract the contents of my EBS.  Cheers Ben"

16957,Amazon EC2 V3,"Malcolm,  I am not an Amazon employee nor do I stand anything to gain by sticking up for them. However as a system administrator with many years of experience on many platforms including ephemeral EC2 instances I can say with quite a degree of confidence that your blaming Amazon for this issue is unfair. I suspect they have provided everything they have promised on their end, but your expectation is unreasonable.  EC2 gives you instances owned and managed at the root level by YOU. Amazon doesn't have some magic back door to login to your box and recover your data when you goof up your system. Ephemeral instances are just that: the data GOES AWAY, it is non permanent. The ""necessary tools"" you mention are contrary to the philosophy of the product. The tools exist, but they are tooled for a different part of the product. If you want to save data or configurations they offer non-ephemeral storage options. These storage options have alternate access methods. EBS can be snapshoted and attached to other instances. S3 storage can be read from anywhere. It is not Amazon's fault if you are not applying the technology properly.  Lastly, about your issue. Is SSH really down on your box or do you not have the firewall open so you can reach the port? Does the machine console output tell you anything about the state of the box? Did YOU enable any other services that might make it reachable ... a network file system or web control panel perhaps? Database port that you can do a dump from? These are things you are responsible for setting up, not Amazon. Maybe these suggestions will help you remember something else you have running.  Caleb"
16957,Amazon EC2 V3,"Yes Caleb, SSH was down, and it was my fault.What I asked was to confirm me that there was a tool to access my XEN virtual machine... and I was going to pay for that service. I just needed a confirmation from Amazon which never occured."

16944,Amazon EC2 V3,"Yes, any instances that you launch become yours. They might be launched from a common shared AMI, but once it's running a copy is created unique to your account.  If it is an ephemoral instance, when you shut it down any changes will be lost. If it is an EBS backed instance, your changes will still be saved on a disk (that you are paying for the storage space to maintain).  Caleb"
16944,Amazon EC2 V3,"Caleb, Thank you very much for taking time to answer my question."
16944,Amazon EC2 V3,"Just a clarification:  The original AMI remains owned by its original owner. Your running instances get a copy of the AMI's contents as their root filesystem, so if the AMI owner deletes the AMI after you launch an instance from it, that instance is not affected. However you will not be able to launch any more instances of a deleted AMI.  If you want to ensure you'll always be able to launch an AMI when you need to, you should burn your own copy of the AMI you use."
16944,Amazon EC2 V3,"Shlomo Thanks for the clarification.   Can I launch an instance of AMI, install my software, setup users etc and then create an AMI out of it so I own that AMI?  TIA"
16944,Amazon EC2 V3,"Yes, absolutly! That is what ""bundling"" is about. Amazon has scripts for this that either you should install or will already be on most pre-prepared AMI's.  For Ephemoral backed instances, the scripts are something you run inside your running instance. They scan through the system collecting all the parts of the base system in whatever state you have modified them to, then package it all up together, upload it to your AWS account and allow you to make that into a new AMI, personalized for and only available to you.  For EBS backed instances this is even simpler. All you need to do is use the tools from inside or outside the instance to snapshot the instance, which basically just shuts it down, snapshots the ebs volume used as root and makes that root file system into a new ami for you, then fires your original instance back up."

16943,Amazon EC2 V3,"Thanks, yes, this could be possible.  But requests for both accounts were in same availavility zone (us-east-1b). Does that mean, than zone A in one AWS account is not zone A in another AWS account?  I have tried to ping from all four zones to zone described as us-east-1b in my old account. The ping time from the instance in us-east-1b under new account was the lowest... so at least form this test, it seems that the zone name us-east-1b means same zone in these two accounts. That's why I don't understand why there is that difference in spot requests (by the way, both requests are still open)."
16943,Amazon EC2 V3,"What is us-east-1b for you may be us-east-1a for me.  Amazon states the following:<blockquote>	""Availability Zones are not the same across accounts. The Availability Zone us-east-1a for	account A is not necessarily the same as us-east-1a for account B. Zone assignments are mapped	independently for each account.""</blockquote>However it could still be that your us-east-1b is the same across both of your accounts."

16942,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi Scott,  Thanks, for the AMIs, we are using them daily and have much benefit from your work. There was a problem with fstab, that I saw was fixed. But I reported on another problem somewhere, about the console not being properly connected on EC2 (something with boot parameters console=hvc0, or something.)  The second I couldn't solve in my images. Eventually it works, but booting takes a long time. So, can you point me to how can fix that?  The things I would really appreciate is to have it clear when we can expect certain fixes (like the console) to be distributed, so we can plan upgrades. And second it would be good if we can have some sort of discussion there, to learn and help each other use Ubuntu (on AWS) even better.

16942,Amazon EC2 V3,"@barossa001,  Your request for desktop images is a popular one.  It will be added to the list.  The reason we do not make desktop images available as released is that currently we only support ""Ubuntu Server"" on EC2.  The server product does not include (by default) a gui of any sort.  However, nothing prevents you from adding one as you've done."
16942,Amazon EC2 V3,"@Moser - I don't know if it's in your place, but I think Canonical should take issue with the fact that Amazon has released their own Linux AMIs instead of using Ubuntu.  Ubuntu is the obvious choice for Amazon to use for these AMIs.  Nobody's going to seriously use a custom Amazon AMI that can't be used anywhere else and has no community.  As for things that could be addressed at the AMI level, I'd like to see a push for more server-optimized variables like a higher number of file descriptors and higher maximum socket backlog.  The AMIs should be tweaked for the typical workloads of ec2 instances (web servers, memcached servers, nosql servers).  I don't know if it's smart to split up into many types of AMI - too much variability, but perhaps some changes could be agreed to by all server user types."
16942,Amazon EC2 V3,"Amazon's Linux AMIs are based on CentOS/RedHat, which is what I and many other server admins are familiar with.  Obviously picking one distro to be the ""official"" amazon distro is going to make some group of users unhappy.  Personally, I'm thrilled they picked CentOS.  You aren't.  Such is life."
16942,Amazon EC2 V3,"@stagingyipitThank you for your input.   I will add it to discussion points.  Regarding ""server-optimized variables like a higher number of file descriptors and higher maximum socket backlog"", Ubuntu Server on EC2 is basically just ""Ubuntu Server"" running on EC2.  Settings like you suggest are possibly useful, and if deemed so, would be applied to the Ubuntu Server product.Regarding Amazon's AMI's.  Amazon is obviously allowed to use whatever they would like for creating their own AMIs.  I believe that there are, and always will be, plenty of reasons to choose Ubuntu, both on EC2 and other platforms."

In order to make it easy for developers to compare CPU capacity between different instance types, we have defined an Amazon EC2 Compute Unit. The amount of CPU that is allocated to a particular instance is expressed in terms of these EC2 Compute Units. We use several benchmarks and tests to manage the consistency and predictability of the performance of an EC2 Compute Unit. One EC2 Compute Unit provides the equivalent CPU capacity of a 1.0-1.2 GHz 2007 Opteron or 2007 Xeon processor. This is also the equivalent to an early-2006 1.7 GHz Xeon processor referenced in our original documentation. Over time, we may add or substitute measures that go into the definition of an EC2 Compute Unit, if we find metrics that will give you a clearer picture of compute capacity."

I believe this is what we're experiencing. We use XFS on an EBS volume for a web server running apache. About once a month all processes on the server will hang and refuse to be killed. Our only option is to replace the instance because a reboot is impossible.   We run a snapshot once per hour using Eric Hammond's ec2-consistent-snapshot script that utilizes xfs_freeze. We are using the 2.6.18-xenU-ec2-v1.0 (aki-9b00e5f2) kernel running Debian Etch.   This has become an extremely painful problem because Apache becomes completely non-responsive (along with all other running processes) so the sites on the box are down. We are able to SSH into the instance and all other operations appear to be running smoothly. It is also impossible to detach the EBS volume when this occurs.  I am afraid to upgrade the kernel because of the reports of XFS issues with the 2.6.21 kernels, but I'm wondering if I should upgrade to the 2.6.18-xenU-ec2-v1.2 (aki-f5c1219c) kernel???

16924,Amazon EC2 V3,"Vince:  My xfs_freeze -u error comes from tests with xfsprogs 3.1.0ubuntu1 on Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid.  Your mileage may vary with older versions on Debian.  It's still safe to unfreeze an unfrozen file system and it hopefully will clear up your issues.  In my experience XFS is fine as a root file system, though I haven't done it on EC2 yet.  I'm a little hesitant to freeze the root file system when taking a snapshot because I have concerns that my snapshot cron job will try to log something to /var/log/syslog in the event of an error and hang everything.  I still take snapshots of the root EBS file system, but it is just to help improve the reliability of the EBS volume and I don't use XFS or freezing.  -- Eric Hammond"

16921,Amazon EC2 V3,"If you're starting it up and giving it an Elastic IP once a day, then you'd do 30 remaps a month.  Your first 100 are free each month, so there would be no charge.However, the hours you don't have an IP associated with an instance are $0.01 per hour, so that would be $0.11 per day Mon-Fri and $0.23 a day on the weekends.-- Don"

16918,Amazon EC2 V3,"Not authorized for images: [ari-a02b00d4, aki-a62b00d2] Hi,before some time I create a custom AMI (took a standard Amazon AMI, installed some stuff on it, and create my own AMI from it, uploaded it o S3 and registered it.).I could create images from this AMI without any issues till yesterday. But suddenly since this morning, when ever I try to create an instance using this AMI it says ""Not authorized for images: [ari-a02b00d4, aki-a62b00d2]"". (I tried Elastic Fox and Amazon Console both but both show the same error).What I figured out is, the Kernal ID and RAM Disk Id doesn't even appear in the list of existing Kernal ID and Ram Disk ID while creating a fresh instance from Amazon's Standard AMI. (Obvisouly when I created a fresh instance while creating my AMI, these Kernal IDs where present thats why my instance got provisioned with the corresponding Kernal and RAM Disk Ids. And since I had used Amazon's instances, the correspoding Kernal ID and RAM Disk ids were owned by Amazon.)Why would amazon delete such things? What should be the work around to the problem?"

16916,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi J,The first thing I would recommend is that you verify that you can create an AMI from the same instance using the CreateImage call (this is available via ec2-create-image).  If an AMI created via that method similarly fails, there may be a configuration issue with your instance that for some reason is not reflected in the original instance.You should also consider specifying a suitable kernel and ramdisk image when you call ec2-register.  I believe that if you do not specify one, the default kernel (which I believe is an older 2.6.16 kernel) will be used, which may not be appropriate for the version of Linux that you are using.Hope this helps!-Jason"
16916,Amazon EC2 V3,Using CreateImage worked fine.  Thanks for the tip!

So it looks like there was an issue with the Security Group. Somewhere down the line it looks like the rules became stuck and were not properly updated when changed.

16902,Amazon EC2 V3,"i-c23c20aa CPU pegged at 100% Hello, yesterday at approximately 4pm US/Eastern, our server instance i-c23c20aa stopped responding to the world. A quick port scan showed SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS services were open but none responded, so I could not shell in to look things over. Logging in to the AWS Management Console showed the instance to be running normally. The Monitoring showed the Average CPU utilization at 100%. Since I could not shell in, the only option I had was to issue a reboot from the management console. This reboot took quite a few minutes, presumably since the CPU was so busy.  We've had processes/threads go crazy before and gobble up CPU, but the impact was that the server seemed ""slow"". I was able to shell in and restart the errant processes. This was different in that the machine wouldn't allow any access. I'm looking for anything that might be available to help me determine what happened. The behavior of the instance seemed out of line with what I would expect and have experienced with my software going astray, so I'm looking for something related to the VM.  Is it possible for some other VM instance to go crazy and take CPU resources away from mine? This seems unlikely since the monitoring showed my instance using resources, I don't know if maybe my allocation of CPU was suddenly diminished.  Are there any other reports of trouble from the hardware system hosting my instance?  Are there any logs or other data on the instance that might help me determine what went wrong?  Are there any other avenues for exploring this problem?  Thanks for your help.  /Daryl"

I am able to connect with each of these instances using remote desktop, but unable to ping one from another and they seem to be unaccessible to each other.  Apart from this, I tried to open the ICMP protocol to everyone so that I can see if the machine if reachable from anywhere. But that also seems to be a failure.

Please check the Windows Firewall rules for ICMP protocol.So if you do not turn on the Server role of File and Printer Sharing, you need to add your own icmp rule or to enable ""File and Printer Sharing (Echo Request - ICMPv4-In)"" of the default Windows Firewall rules.I hope this helps you"
16894,Amazon EC2 V3,Thanks for your reply. is that firewall setting on the windows box the reason why I cannot access one instance from another?

16891,Amazon EC2 V3,IPIP (IP encapsulation) : on the feature roadmap? I've seen forum posts / requests for AWS platform support to allows various LVS deployments from way back in 2006. It would seem that the most promising LVS option is LVS over an IPIP tunnel.  There are a few schools of thought as to the challenges for AWS to over come to allow this to work. Two of which are source address spoofing - critical for LVS/TUN and the allowance of IPIP to transit over the AWS network.  So then to the question:  Has there been any progress on this within AWS to allow these types of deployments and if not will there be? Here at my company we just cannot use ELB as it stands as it just cannot handle the rate I need and I would really love to not have to go to a solution external to the EC2 cloud.  Tia. Dave.

Constant Bisectional Bandwidth, CBB) regardless of the number of instances in the Group.  If the instance limits on your account permit you to start 200 CC1.4XLarge instances, you will get CBB between all of them.For customers familiar with supercomputer architectures, we suggest they think about Placement Groups the same way as super-cluster ""Connected Units"" or ""Scalable Units"" and build Groups of comparable size  (e.g., 180 like LANL RoadRunner, 144-162 like LLNL Coastal/Sierra), and then use multiple Placement Groups for high scale-out.With CBB connectivity, instances can communicate in any pattern within the Placement Group and will not be impacted by each other or other customers during transit between instances. Communication outside of the Placement Group (e.g., EBS, S3, Internet) is not guaranteed to have this property and may be limited in other ways.re: m1.xlarge, other instance typesWe do not currently offer Placement Group assurances with other instance families, but are always looking for feedback on important use cases were it is required."

Ping (ICMP) works but I can not get any TCP running (not SSH not MySQL); we don't have a problem with our other instances.  All instances are located in same region eu-west-1b.  My first suggestion was an error in sec. groups.  So I added the new Instance to our DB Sec. Group but this did not had any effect; I tried to change more on sec. groups but without of luck unfortunately rules I have dropped and added again are not working.  Has someone experienced something like this?  What can I do?  I don't want to relocate our database server to a new instance (also I have an EIP and CNAME and EBS configured)...  (btw: I do not run an iptables firewall)
16873,Amazon EC2 V3,"Are you using RDS?  If not, then DB Security Groups do not apply.  If you're running your own database server on an EC2 instance then you set up the regular EC2 security group for that instance and all the servers that will connect to it."
16873,Amazon EC2 V3,"We are running our own MySQL.  I have following Sec. Groups configured:  default - all server are started in default (except admin server) and one additional group:  database - only the database servers appsrv - all app servers admin - our admin servers (monitoring, ssh etc)  Problem is access from ""admin"" to ""database"".   I have allowed  group ""admin""  to access ""database"" and allowed ""group"" database"" to access ""admin"".  ICMP (ping) works but telnet to port 3306 (default MySQL) or 80 does not get a connection.  Connectivity from all other Instances is no problem - only the Instance in ""admin"" has problems."

16871,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi Michael,It sounds like the problem here may be related to the AMI creation process or the configuration of your new instance.  Based on the rest of your console output, your instance may be unable to find the /dev directory, which could cause it to fail to boot.Since this instance is EBS-backed, you have some options as far as debugging this issue:- If your original instance is still running, you should review your configuration there to ensure that the instance configuration is correct (one thing to help diagnose where the issue is occurring is to reboot the original instance, but if that is also improperly configured, you could render the instance unbootable).You may want to review the contents of your /etc/fstab file to make sure your filesystem mappings are correct.  You also may want to make sure that you are using an appropriate kernel and ramdisk for your instance.- You can also detach the root volume (vol-deb98bb7) from your failed instance ( i-837063e9) and review it for possible issues.Your diagnostics for i-837063e9 do show that you have several EBS volumes mounted, between sdb and sdd.  Those mount points are reserved for local storage, and attaching EBS volumes to devices outside the range /dev/sd[f-p][1-6] can have unpredictable results.  I suggest you try detaching those volumes, reboot to ensure that your instance comes up properly, then reattach the volumes to supported device ids.Regards,-Jason"

16868,Amazon EC2 V3,"Some of our visitors report ""Server not found"" with Elastic Load Balancing We've been using the elastic load balancers for quite a while now and since the first day we keep getting sporadic messages of our users that they get a ""server not found"" error when trying to get to our website. With one user we were able to do a little test and asked him to type in the current IP address of the load balancer instance instead of the domain name. Interestingly enough that worked absolutely fine! The big question here is what is the problem? We have a very reliable and big DNS hoster using 3 DNS servers which are always up. We've added the CNAME for the load balancer to our www. sub-domain and that works for most of our users and ourselves without any problems. Strangely enough our DNS hoster tells us regarding cnames: ""If you use cnames people using BIND9 may get problems resolving your domain name"". Is that a general problem and does it have anything to do with our problem?So what can we do to avoid people hitting a ""Server not found"" error. Is it something to do with our DNS hoster or is there a problem with the elastic load balancers? In case it's the DNS what can we do to avoid this? Is there something we might have done wrong?Thanks a lot in advance"
16868,Amazon EC2 V3,"It's possible that some DNS servers along the way to your clients do not like the long DNS packets that result from having a long CNAME entry.  You can try changing the name of your ELB to a single letter, which will generate a new DNS name that is likely shorter than what you currently use. This will require a DNS change, but the effect should be transparent as long as you add the same back-end instances to both ELBs. Once the DNS change propagates you can delete the old ELB.  Check out this thread for more details:  http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/thread.jspa?threadID=42508&tstart=45"

16866,Amazon EC2 V3,"Windows Instance Wont Start Hi,  I've searched the forums and found people with similar problems but no solutions, so well I'm trying again with a detailed post on exactly what happened.  I have created a new instance from our windows 2008 64bit AMI as a replacement for one of our current instances (large instance). I took a snapshot of the current drives on the running instance and then swapped these drives into the new instance (the AMI contains default drives). I finished off configuring the instance and restarted to make sure everything worked. I then shut-down the instance overnight to save costs with the intention of switching the instances the next day. When I started up the instance the next day one of the drives did not appear in my computer, going into computer management I found it had some how become deactivated, so I reactivated the disk and carried on. I decided to do a final shut-down and start to make sure the machine would work as expected. Now starting up the machine never seems to complete, I get no system log output from the API. I left the machine for over 2 hours and still no system log (tried RDP and no luck either). So I shut-down the instance, put the original disks of the instance back and still no luck. Finally I tried removing both the additional disks and starting it up, again nothing. Finally started up a new instance and transferred the disks into there, they work perfectly and the instance starts up and shuts down without problems. I've run check disk on the drives and found no errors. Everything seems fine with them.  All the instances in this case use the following structure for the disks, all disks are EBS. 	C: System (windows, also has IIS7 and its configuration) (basic disk) 	D: Data (used to store the software and configuration) (dynamic disk with a single simple volume) 	E: Temp (used for transferring in various files, new releases etc.) (dynamic disk with a single simple volume)  Configuration of our AMI/Instance includes: IIS7 IIS6 (for SMTP) Filezilla (we are migrating away from FTP however some specific cases still require it) iBackup .Net 4.0 (running asp.net websites) Nod32 Antivirus with recommend server configuration Notepad++  Only other thing I should add is during set-up of the new server I attached and detached a few drives to copy over various files etc. I've been assuming this is a disk related issue and not an application related issue as I never get any system log output, is there anything other than the disks which could be causing this problem?  I've spent a number of hours trying to research this and come up blank. Does anyone know what went wrong with the server, and is there anything I can enable which would give me more information in the system log if the error occurred again?"
16866,Amazon EC2 V3,"Ok, after recreating the instance and restarting after almost every little change I have tracked down a possible cause, only after we added the SSL certificates to IIS7 did the server stop starting up correctly. This post at stack overflow suggests the issue is real - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2373997/aws-ec2-instance-is-gone-after-reboot-when-ssl-certificate-is-bound-to-website but I cant find a solution.  Anyone got any suggestions as to why this occurs?"
16866,Amazon EC2 V3,"If nothing else, your post has helped me identify what's been going wrong with my AMI situation.  I'm experiencing the exact same issue, where once I import a domain cert, and bind it to a website the system will no longer boot correctly.  I've been going crazy trying to figure out what the issue is as EC2 just shows the instance as running with no console output and no indication as to what the issue is.  But this leaves me in a bit of a pickle... what do we do now?  Is this a new issue with AWS?  I can't imagine that no one has been using SSL on a windows server..."
16866,Amazon EC2 V3,We finally solved the issue. This took quite a while but it was how we were importing the certificates from another server which was the issue. To get around this simply reissue the certificate(s) for the new machine and it should reboot fine (tested about 5-6 reboots with certificates bound).

Instead, they're reservations of capacity that guarantee that you'll always be able to launch an instance that matches your Reserved Instance criteria in the Availability Zone of the reservation for the term of the Reserved Instance.When you purchase Reserved Instances, the billing system checks each hour to see how many total instances you have running that match the same instance type and Availability Zone as your Reserved Instances. If it is less than the number of instances you have running in that Availability Zone, you will be charged the Reserved Instance Rate for each instance running that hour.If the number of instances running in that Availability Zone is greater than the number of ReservedInstances you have for that Availability Zone, you will be charged the On-Demand rate for the additional instances.More information is available on the Reserved Instances details page:http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/reserved-instances/Best regards,Matthew P."

16853,Amazon EC2 V3,"Elastic Load Balancer terminates first created instances Hi all,  my ELB setup controls 2 webserver instances, web01 and web02.  When he needs to create another one, web03, does it fine, but when the load diminishes, it destroys the first created instance, web01 (instead last one, web03).  Is this the normal behaviour? Is there any form of prevent it?  Thanks in advance, Simon."
16853,Amazon EC2 V3,No one?
16853,Amazon EC2 V3,AutoScaling creates and destroys instances based on the trigger you set. It can be integrated into the ELB load balancer.  Which instance is chosen for termination is not subject to control: it is random. There's no way to change this.  Why do you care which instance is terminated? In order for your application to scale properly it needs to be completely unaware what machine it is running on.
16852,Amazon EC2 V3,"Elastic IP vs. dynamic DNS: which propagates faster? In availability planning for our web app, I'm wondering which propagates faster - dynamic DNS (meaning a TTL of 20-60) or Elastic IP?  I thought for some time that Elastic IP would be faster, but then discovered that it can take minutes to propagate (with some forum postings claiming 10m!).  Just wondering what others are seeing, and whether it even makes sense to pay for Elastic IPs, if dynamic DNS is as fast or faster. Thanks."
16852,Amazon EC2 V3,"Elastic IP changes tend to happen in under a minute.  DNS changes (Dynamic or ""regular"") propagate in an unpredictable timeframe (somewhere under 24 hours usually). TTL values are reliable only when the DNS lookup happens directly on the authoritative nameserver (the one hosting the domain's DNS entries) . DNS lookups that happen on non-authoritative nameservers are cached by those nameservers, and not all nameservers respect the TTL of the authoritative nameserver. So the propagation time is artificially increased, depending on the caching behavior of intervening nameservers between the client and the authoritative nameserver.  Also, some browsers and client-side programs (Java being a notable example) cache DNS lookups for longer than necessary (forever, in the default Java configuration).  I recommend the use of Elastic IPs for public-facing services. For internal services you can use Dynamic DNS, since you have tight control over the DNS lookup path in your own applications and you can ensure the authoritative nameservers are always used, guaranteeing you the TTL in the DNS entry."

16836,Amazon EC2 V3,EC2 is not as elastic as it used to be.  There aren't just problems in the EU region. There is a zone in us-east-1 that has had insufficient capacity for 2 months now.  Amazon definitely appears to have fairly long running issues with capacity. The health dashboard doesn't seem to be designed to show you where there is or isn't capacity.I used to be a bit of an evangelist for ec2 around my workplace but I've been silent for a while now.  There is a lack of transparency with respect to capacity and I have yet to receive any sort of official response to any of my posts with respect to these kinds of issues.My suspicion is that spot instances are implemented in a way that leads to these sorts of capacity issues.  I suspect that since they've been introduce they have led to chronic over-subscription in certain availability zones.I would expect that a regular instance should be able to run in any zone in which there are running spot instances perhaps at the expense of a spot instance.  I believe that this isn't the case however.I would expect that a spot instances should be able to run in any zone in which there are running spot instances having a lower max price. I've been waiting for a spot instance to run for more than half a month.  The max price for the request is HIGHER than the normal hourly rate for that instance type AND much HIGHER than the spot price has been for the past month.

16836,Amazon EC2 V3,That is what I see when there is insufficient capacity.  It used to display an error before they changed the interface to support tags.Try it with elasticfox or using the command line tools and you should get the error.
16835,Amazon EC2 V3,"Associating an Elastic IP is not working before the instance is 'running'. Several sources on the web say that it should be possible to associate an instance with an Elastic IP as soon as the instance ID is received. They say it doesn't have to be in the 'running' state, so it should be possible to assign even when the instance is still 'pending'.Actually, most often it works exactly as explained above. But it seems this behavior is not entirely reliable.I have been testing an automatic bootstrapping technique where new nodes are launched from another controlling node. Every now and then I'm getting the following error messages:EC2 Instance: i-abcdef01Associating the Elastic IP 12.34.56.78: Client.InvalidInstanceId: The instance 'i-abcdef01' is not in the 'running' state(The ID and IP have been changed.)Below is the part of the bash script that is producing these messages.So... should it or shouldn't it work? Is this officially supported, or is some other method of assigning Elastic IP's more recommendable? If I base my scripts on this technique, can I rely on them to be future compatible?Any opinions or pointers would be welcome!<span style=""color: #009933""># Start the EC2 instance and discover its identity information.# This script is designed to start only one instance at a time.</span><span style=""color: #000099"">echo</span> -e ""Launching: \c""<span style=""color: #000099"">ec2run</span> -k ""$KEYPAIR"" $EC2_OPTIONS -n 1 > ""$RESPONSE_FILE""<span style=""color: #993300"">if [ </span>""$?"" <span style=""color: #993300"">-ne</span> ""0""<span style=""color: #993300""> ]; then</span>        <span style=""color: #000099"">echo</span> FAILED        <span style=""color: #993300"">exit</span> 1<span style=""color: #993300"">else</span>        <span style=""color: #000099"">echo</span> OK<span style=""color: #993300"">fi</span>INSTANCE_ID=$(<span style=""color: #000099"">grep</span> ""INSTANCE"" ""$RESPONSE_FILE"" | <span style=""color: #000099"">awk</span> '{ print $2 }')<span style=""color: #000099"">echo</span> EC2 Instance: ""$INSTANCE_ID""<span style=""color: #993300"">if [ -n</span> ""$ELASTIC_IP"" <span style=""color: #993300"">]; then</span>    <span style=""color: #000099"">echo</span> -e ""Associating the Elastic IP $ELASTIC_IP: \c""    <span style=""color: #000099"">ec2assocaddr</span> ""$ELASTIC_IP"" -i ""$INSTANCE_ID"" > /dev/null <span style=""color: #993300"">|| exit</span> $?    <span style=""color: #000099"">echo</span> OK<span style=""color: #993300"">fi</span>"
16834,Amazon EC2 V3,"Internal IP addresses I can't seem to locate this answer.  Are my instances accessible by other amazon EC2 customers via their private IPs? Or, are they nat'd somehow to keep my instances separate from other users?"
16834,Amazon EC2 V3,"They're accessible by whatever access you grant to the security groups they belong to. By default that is no access to anyone else. You can add access to allow specific other accounts to access your instances, but you have to configure that, it's off by default."
16834,Amazon EC2 V3,"What is the easiest way to allow my internal instances to have full access to each other?  I dont want anyone else having that access, but I would like for the instances themselves to be able to communicate openly with each other."
16834,Amazon EC2 V3,"Or, would it make sense to setup a VPC and set my own subnet (and then create one rule, versus a rule in every security group I have)?  If I don't have a VPN setup, it appears as though the VPC is free to use?"
16834,Amazon EC2 V3,To achieve that you can just add the access group to itself.
16834,Amazon EC2 V3,"After a quick search, I didnt find any instructions on how to do that through the interface.  Any direction would be greatly appreciated."
16834,Amazon EC2 V3,"In the AWS console, set the various boxes to:Custom, tcp, 1, 65535, GROUPNAME""GROUPNAME"" is the name of the current security group.  Hit Save.  Now all boxes in the GROUPNAME group have unlimited access to each other."
16834,Amazon EC2 V3,"From the AWS console, it sets the dropdowns and values to null (blank) whenever I insert the group name.  any advice?"
16834,Amazon EC2 V3,Nevermind - this might be a google chrome issue.
16834,Amazon EC2 V3,"Actually, you're right, it does erase the dropdowns.  I guess they made it so if you type a group name, that group has full access no matter what.  Just type the group name and hit save.  Even easier!"

16832,Amazon EC2 V3,"Reserved instance issues I recently purchased a reserved instance for my server, but did not see the reserved pricing on my most recent bill.  Upon further inspection, the reserved instance was created in the east-1c availability zone, however my server is running in the east-1a availability zone.  I do not want to terminate my running server and bring it back up in the east-1c zone.  Is it possible for me to somehow switch my reserved instance to the east-1a zone so I can apply that reserved pricing to my running server?"

16831,Amazon EC2 V3,"Help with making an AMI from Ubuntu instance Hi all,I am trying to figure out how to make an AMI from my running Ubuntu Karmic instance.This is what I have done so far:1) There seems to be million ways to get the ami tools on the server but the following seems to be the easiest so this is what I did:sudo sed -i.dist 's,universe$,universe multiverse,' /etc/apt/sources.listsudo apt-get updatesudo apt-get install ec2-api-tools ec2-ami-tools2) Then all documentation said that it is just case of running the following:sudo ec2-bundle-vol -d /mnt/ami-my-instance/ -k /mnt/my-key.pem -c /mnt/my-certificate.pem -u my-user-idHowever, when I did this I got the following error:mount: Could not find any loop device. Maybe this kernel does not know       about the loop device? (If so, recompile or `modprobe loop'.)ERROR: execution failed: ""mount -o loop /mnt/ami-my-instance/image /mnt/img-mnt""I resolved this with the following:sudo ln -s /lib/modules/2.6.31-307-ec2 /lib/modules/2.6.31-302-ec2But still got the above error. So next what I did was:sudo modprobe loop and got back:FATAL: Module loop not found.Reading on it seems like it might not be even possible to get the command ""mount -o loop /mnt/ami-my-instance/image /mnt/img-mnt"" working with the most recent versions of Ubuntu, so I am kind of stuck now Anyone able to tell me how I can progress from here? I have started reading on Ubuntu vmbuilder tutorials, but that looks awfully complicated. Is that really the only way nowadays or is there a way to fix the loop error so I can get ec2-bundle-vol working?Hopefully someone is able to advice on this.Thanks in advance,Olli"

16823,Amazon EC2 V3,"How to specify different zone for ebs volume on ec2-run-instances cmd? Hi,  I have my own (ubuntu lucid) ebs-boot ami and I have automated the creation of new instances with the ec2-run-instances command. I currently manually create a separate ebs volume from another snapshot that is attached to the instance as /dev/sdf after the instance is up. Again, to be clear, this is not the eb-boot ami, this is a separate ebs volume that is created from a snapshot that is attached as /dev/sdf.  In going over the ec2-run-instances command, I realized that I can specify the new 'block-device-mapping at instance creation time. For example,   ec2-run-instances <AMI-ID> ... --block-device-mapping /dev/sdf=SNAP-ID:10:false ...  I have done this and the command works great - it creates a new instance from the ebs ami, allocates another volume from target snapshot and then mounts it all on the same command. However, I am running into two problems:  1) The second device mapping automatically defaults to zone us-east-1a. Is there a way to specify the zone for the second ebs volume on the command line? I currently put all my instances in zone 3, so this is a problem.  2) The keypair name gets managled somehow when I specify it on the command line.

16812,Amazon EC2 V3,"AMI is S3 or EBS? Hi -- would anyone be so kind as to tell me how I can tell if my AMI has been persisted to S3 (my preference) or EBS?Everyone says I should be able to see traces of my AMI in S3, but I went to the S3 browser and my S3 is empty!  (But that's very suspicious because I can store and retrieve things through boto just fine.)Are there any other ways I can definitely find out?And if it turns out that I have an EBS AMI instead of an S3 one, how can I convert it?  It is under 10 GiB, so it was my understanding that there should be no problems in having it be in S3.Thanks!"
16812,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi thereThe easiest option I can suggest to you is that you login to the AWS web console select the instances tab on the left hand side of the page. This will bring up a list of all your running instances. On this list you will see one the Column marked ""Root Device"" if the device title is Instance-store then your instance is S3 backed otherwise it's going to be an EBS backed instance.If your instances are S3 backed there is no option to convert them to EBS backed AMI's you will need to startup a replacement EBS backed instance and transfer your data and settings to the new instance.I just want to make sure that you understand that the EBS backed instances are more resilient and have persistence when you start stop your instances. You can also make snapshots of EBS volumes of your server allowing you to keep multiple backups of your volumes which is not possible on S3 backed instances.S3 backed AMI's do not have persistence and if your instance should reboot or crash you will loose any data that's currently there. I hope this answers your question and thanks again for posting to our forums."
16812,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi, thank you very much.  There was a lot of good information in your answer.I recognize EBS is more flexible than S3, but it was my understanding that EBS had about three 9's of reliability and S3 had about six.  Having those six 9's of reliability would be awesome.  Especially since I'm only trying to save a small root drive with it.For each AMI I have, I see a snapshot.  I see on other Amazon pages that snapshots are always backed up by S3 ... correct?  But for each of my running instances based of my AMIs, the root device says EBS.  And when no instances are running, I don't see anything under the ""Volumes"" area of my EC2 dashboard.Does this mean my snapshot is actually saved in EBS instead of S3?  That's the only way I can reconcile all of these facts.Thanks!"
16812,Amazon EC2 V3,"S3 backed AMI's do not have persistence and if your instance should reboot or crash you will loose any data that's currently there.  Just a clarification: The only data that is lost when an instance reboots is the contents of memory. All disks - whether ephemeral or EBS - remain unaffected by a reboot. This is true for both instance-store instances and EBS-backed instances.  JasonM@AWS, perhaps you meant ""terminate"" instead of ""reboot"" ?"
16812,Amazon EC2 V3,Wait -- how about this explanation.  The old style of doing things was to have an AMI stored on S3 and boot through that.  But that has a number of limitations.So the new style of doing things is to have your AMI stored on EBS and boot through that.  And you can still get six 9's of reliability by snapshotting your EBS to S3.Am I getting closer to understanding?Thanks!
16812,Amazon EC2 V3,"amillsx,EBS-backed AMI's are launched from snapshots, which are stored on S3 and have six 9's of reliabibilty, just like an S3-backed AMI.  IMHO the real questions are:1) is fast launch time important (advantage EBS)2) do you require, or benefit from ability to ""stop"" an instance for period of time, and thus avoid hourly run-time charges? (advantage EBS)A use-case for #2 is a windows instance I run as a replacement for VMware on my Mac. VMware was a resource hog and I only needed it for a few specialty apps I used now an then. Now I have a windows EBS-backed instance that I start and stop when I need those apps. They actually startup faster than VMware could load my Windows VM, and it's cost me less than $5 a month so far in run-time and storage charges.Regarding snapshots- you need to be careful- you shouldn't be writing to disk when you snapshot, as some data is invariably in a memory cache somewhere at that moment and could be lost- or worse, corrupt the snapshot by its absense.I prefer S3-backed instances for full-time Linux servers. I make use of EBS volumes for data that changes often, and use snapshot scripts from <span class=""f"">alestic.com</span> and techniques Shlomo has blogged about to make sure my EBS volumes are in a ""frozen"" state before snapshots are taken."

16802,Amazon EC2 V3,"ELB health checks do not always occur in a timely fashion (I'm re-posting this as a question, since I didn't get a response last time, and we're having this issue again today)Hello,We have a group of testing servers sitting behind an ELB that are almost always in a stopped state (only the ELB runs full-time). Our automated testing framework occasionally starts these servers and watches the ELB for 10 minutes (to ensure that the web servers are running) before deploying the latest code and starting its tests. This process usually works fine, but every once in a while, the ELB seems to get into a state where health checks do not occur for 20 minutes or more. This means the load balancer continues to return 503s, even though the webservers are actually up and running.I've seen other posts where people had forgotten to allow access through their firewalls, but I don't think this is the case for us, since we don't run a local firewall on our instances. I can also see hits in the request logs when I access the servers directly from our office. What I'm not seeing are any recent requests from clients with a user-agent of ""ELB-HealthChecker/1.0."" Funny, just as I was about to post this, I noticed that the health check started occurring again, but nobody changed anything. Looking at the logs, I see a period from 19:59:05 to 20:25:57 GMT (2010-09-21) where the servers were up and running, but no health checks occurred, even though our ELB is configured to perform health checks every 60 seconds.- Michael Conigliaro"
16802,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi Michael,If the instance is in Stopped state, the load balancer temporarily stops the health check. It then periodically checks to see when the instance is back into Running state.For the use case you described, it would be better to deregister the instance from the load balancer when it is not in use (before it is Stopped), and re-register it when it is in use again (after it is Running). In that case, the load balancer will put it into service right away."
16802,Amazon EC2 V3,"OK, thanks for the reply. I have updated our scripts so that the instances are de-registered and re-registered with the ELB every time they are started/stopped. The problem now is that the instances tend to get stuck in an ""out of service"" state with a description of ""instance registration is still in progress."" The instances might sit in this state for an hour or two before they're actually in service behind the ELB.- Michael Conigliaro"
16802,Amazon EC2 V3,"I have a similar situation.  The node was stuck in an ""out of service"" state with a description of ""instance registration is still in progress."" for quite a bit.  I removed and re-added it from the load balancer and it was immediately in service.  Should the node be completely up before it is added into service?"

16791,Amazon EC2 V3,"EC2 Security and Newbie Questions I've ready as much documentation as I can stand to read, but do have a few questions:  1) I will be creating Windows instances.  From what I can tell, those instances auto-create a EBS volume.  To that end, what would cause a volume to be terminated (outside of me clicking on the terminate button) that I need to be careful of?  Meaning, what ways could I lose the data (outside of a windows virus, etc) on that instance?  2) Can any of the EBS volumes be accessed from the outside world?  Translation - do I have to worry about my data being accessible through a AWS webservice that I'm not familiar with?  3) I've tried to find a guide for a recommend windows instance configuration for a basic environment.  For example, right now, I have a gogrid account that has a webserver, a database server, and then an f5 load balancer in front of it all to allow for scaling later.  Any have any good advice on how to create a solution that will scale easily in the future?  4) If I have an app that allows users to map CNAMES to the application, do the load balancers have IP addresses that I should setup now? (or, if I create an elastic ip, that will be the loadbalanced ip in the future) .. if that makes sense.  Thanks!"
16791,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hello,  I want to get answers to this questions.  I have the same doubts!  Regards, DD"
16791,Amazon EC2 V3,"1) I will be creating Windows instances.  From what I can tell, those instances auto-create a EBS volume. To that end, what would cause a volume to be terminated (outside of me clicking on the terminate button) that I need to be careful of?  Instances should only terminate due to API action (e.g. clicking on the terminate button) or hardware failure.   Meaning, what ways could I lose the data (outside of a windows  virus, etc) on that instance?  If you have the root (C:) volume set to persist after termination, then you should only loose data if the EBS storage has a massive failure.  2) Can any of the EBS volumes be accessed from the outside world?  Translation - do I have to worry about my data being accessible through a AWS webservice that I'm not familiar with?  EBS volumes are only accessible to EC2 instances with the same owner as the EBS volume.  However, if you create a snapshot, then the snapshot can be shared with other EC2 users.  3) I've tried to find a guide for a recommend windows instance configuration for a basic environment.  For example, right now, I have a gogrid account that has a webserver, a database server, and then an f5 load balancer in front of it all to allow for scaling later.  Any have any good advice on how to create a solution that will scale easily in the future?  I would suggest looking at Elastic Load Balancers.  They offer similar functionality to the f5 load balancer in GoGrid.  4) If I have an app that allows users to map CNAMES to the application, do the load balancers have IP addresses that I should setup now? (or, if I create an elastic ip, that will be the loadbalanced ip in the future) .. if that makes sense.  Each Elastic Load Balancer you create has a dedicated hostname that should be the target of a CNAME."

16789,Amazon EC2 V3,"The AWS Premium Support Guidelines and FAQ describe the available offerings.  The support does not cover help with system design, architecture or code development.  However it does cover general how-to questions, and provide help with configuring the services and using the tools.http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/guidelines/http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/faqs/A  common architecture for web-applications such as the one you've described is to have a group of ""frontend + application-server"" instances, which in your case would run IIS, hosting identical copies of your ASP.NET and PHP code.  In such an architecture each frontend host connects to the same central database, that is running on a separate instance from any frontend instance (you may want to use the same instance for your SQLServer and MySQL, or they could go on separate instances).  In EC2 the frontend instances would belong to an AutoScaling group, with an Elastic Load Balancer distributing requests amongst them.  The separate backend database instance would not be AutoScaled.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-tier_%28computing%29#Web_development_usageSome advantages of migrating to such an architecture instead of moving everything to a larger instance are:* Sometimes computers fail.  If you're running everything on one instance and it fails, your applications are completely ""down"".  However if you have multiple copies of the frontend and one goes down, the Elastic Load Balancer will stop sending traffic to it, reducing the impact on your customers.  Unhealthy instances in a group can be automatically replaced by AutoScaling.* If your traffic continues to increase or you begin hosting new applications and you are still running on only one instance, you will eventually have to migrate everything to an even larger host.  With the multi-tiered architecture you simply increase the size of your frontend fleet.  AutoScaling can do this for you automatically.* You may find that different EC2 instance-types ""fit"" better for the frontend vs. the database.  You may find that the database performs better with more memory that isn't needed on each of the the frontend instances.  Some downsides to this architecture:* There are more components to configure and maintain.  However the EC2 facilities such as AutoScaling automate much of this once it's configured.* The central database is still a single-point of failure.  However both SQLServer and MySQL allow deployments on multiple instances.  For MySQL, the Relational Database Service (RDS) can manage this for you.Moving to this architecture does require the ASP.NET and PHP code be constructed for such a deployment.  Any shared state in the application (such as user-sessions) must be kept in the central database, and not on an individual frontend server (since individual web requests can go to random frontend servers, and AutoScaling may start up or shut down instances depending on the load).  If these are 3rd-party applications you are hosting, you will need to consult their documentation to see if they support this style of deployment.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_nothing_architecture-Eric"

16780,Amazon EC2 V3,"With EC2, you pay for individual instances by the hour.  Each instance is a separate virtual machine.  This means that you would have to use similar steps to set up distributed rendering in EC2 as you would to set up distributed rendering with a set of computers in your office."

16779,Amazon EC2 V3,"Lost administrator password in Windows Hi,Yesterday I created a Windows instance (<span>i-b608ccc1 from AMI ID </span>ami-c1ebc0b5).I connected with remote desktop, logged in and changed the Administrator password.Today I can't log in. The password isn't correct.If I try to log in with the original password, that doesn't work neither.If I do a ""Get Windows Admin password"" i recieve the original password from yesterday.What to do?"
16779,Amazon EC2 V3,"The Get Password API call does not return the ""current"" password of the instance.  It only returns the random password which was assigned when the instance was started.Your only recourse if you've lost your admin password is to launch a new instance, as Amazon does not have any way to set it or retrieve the existing password.In the future, it is good practice, both operationally and security standpoint to create an administrative account (in addition to Administrator) on the instance with a password known only to you.  You will run less risk of being totally locked out and it also allows you the opportunity to set a much more complex password on your Administrator account to prevent it from being compromised."
16779,Amazon EC2 V3,"This might help others:I had a similar situation. I figured out when I restarted the instance, it got another ID, hence the shortcut was created initially was pointing to a - then - non-existing instance, so the password could not be checked by the instance and got the error message.From the Management Console I chose Connect and recreated the shortcut.Voila, I was able to login with the password I set earlier.Good luck!"
16779,Amazon EC2 V3,"Simply stop the instance (DO NOT terminate it). Detach the EBS volume. Start up a Linux instance and attach the Windows EBS volume to it.

16778,Amazon EC2 V3,SSH timeout between instances since EC2 internal networking issue of 9/13 HelloWe have recently started seeing timeouts connecting via SSH between machines in EC2 (US-East).  This connection is part of auto-scaling where a transient app server registers with a software load balancer (haproxy). The timeouts occur within a single availability zone and across zones. This system has been running for a year and only since last week have we seen this issue.The issue started soon after the internal EC2 network issue of 9/13 - which greatly affected our hosts but they recovered once the EC2 team resolved their issue.I need help to determine whether other folks are seeing this or whether someone from AWS could take a look and provide guidance - has there been a change in networking since 9/13 that could be impacting this?Mike
16778,Amazon EC2 V3,"I'm not sure about any networking changes, but have you tried setting the ServerAliveInterval option of SSH?"
16778,Amazon EC2 V3,Thanks for the suggestion. I tried that with a value of 3 (3 retries or something) and it didn't help.
16778,Amazon EC2 V3,"In order to gather more info I added a traceroute before calling SSH. This somehow has reduced how often the problem occurs.

16777,Amazon EC2 V3,"Virtual IPs for a instance Hi Amazon,      Is it possible to create virtual private ips in my instance. Any private IP would be fine. We need 5 IPs. We will use this internally in our application. Can you throw some light here.  --raj"
16777,Amazon EC2 V3,"EC2 does not have Virtual IPs, it has Elastic IPs. Unlike virtual IPs, Elastic IPs cannot be integrated into the OS's network layer, since they are NATted.  For more info:  http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=1346"
16777,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hello,     What is the point in getting a PUBLIC IP address while I just need a private IP for my application. Am I missing something here?  Thanks Raj"
16777,Amazon EC2 V3,"Are you talking about private IP's on the EC2 internal network? Or just dummy IP's that ""don't go anywhere""? Obviously the later is a matter of OS support and not EC2 support. There are lots of dummy adapters that you could use for this purpose under Windows and Linux."
16776,Amazon EC2 V3,"Public IP address for ec2.amazonaws.com Our corporate firewall blocks all outbound connections, except the ones we whitelist.    I'm currently developing an application that would leverage the EC2 command line API to provision instances, monitor status etc.  I see that when using the API all of the outbound requests are hitting ec2.amazonaws.com, or 72.21.206.77.   Would we be safe to assume that the IP address for API calls is relatively stable? I'd like to avoid proxying all of the API calls to a machine in our DMZ if at all possible.  Thanks in advance, Ryan"
16776,Amazon EC2 V3,"Okay, so I just rechecked the DNS and its coming up 72.21.210.54, which leads me to believe that the API at ec2.amazonaws.com exists on a range of IP addresses.  Is this range listed somewhere?"
16776,Amazon EC2 V3,Your company's firewall policy sounds crazily restrictive.  I don't think there is a predictable or published range for the EC2 API endpoints. You could try opening up the whole CIDR range but that's not a guarantee.
16776,Amazon EC2 V3,"Fortunately I was incorrect about just how restrictive the policy is.  We actually allow outbound port 80/443.  Outbound port blocking imho is a really silly measure that adds false security to a system. Sure a rogue virus could go wild inside the corp firewall and disallowing outbound connections to unknown ports would slow or stop most of those, but haven't virus authors caught on by now and simply started using port 80/443 as a means to export their payload? Anyhow, it would be nice to restrict the outbound http requests to known hosts that our host is supposed to connect to in the unlikely event of compromise, but I guess we'll just have to wait for Amazon to publish what subnet's their api interface may exist on at any given time."

16775,Amazon EC2 V3,"I don't know about the Windows instances, but the Linux instances have a smaller boot partition and a second larger partition for the main instance storage. (boot from /dev/sda1, promised storage on /dev/sda2)I'd imagine that Windows instances are probably setup the same way. Have you gone into a disk partitioning tool to see if there is another partition available to you to format and use?I think that Amazon partitions in this way so that you have more flexibility in filesystems and layout for the main storage."

16766,Amazon EC2 V3,"Need more RAM and CPU size on this instances Hi ,I am having the instance of small size and it is not EBS based. its a normal instance. My applications are running on it now I need more RAM and CPU size on this instances.I heard that there is a form which we have to fill. Can you please tell me the location of that form so that i fill it and send it to Amazon.Regards,Suukhbir"
16765,Amazon EC2 V3,Cannot rename Windows 2008 Server after launch Hi;I purchased a reserved instance and chose one of the amazon quick start AMI's for Windows Server 3008 and launched it. Once logged in to the server i try to rename it and it says it is going to get the new name after a reboot but when it comes back up it still has the old name. I am new to AWS. Am i missing something basic? Do i need to create an image first and then use that? Any help is appreciated.James
16765,Amazon EC2 V3,"i figured it out. I had to go into C:\Program Files\Amazon\Ec2ConfigService and run Ec2ConfigServiceSettings.exe and remove the checkmark from ""set computer name"". Once i did this i was able to rename my server to what i wanted it to be and it persisted after a reboot."
16764,Amazon EC2 V3,Cannot access genuitec.com website (EU server) This is the MyEclipse and Mobione websiteI cannot access this site via IE or Firefox on a EU windows instance.I have this on ALL my EU ec2 instances.Is this site blocked?
16763,Amazon EC2 V3,"Can't boot EBS AMI: udev_monitor_new_from_netlink: error getting socket I did the following to migrate an instance to a different AZ:  - launched an instance of the public Ubuntu AMI image, ami-d197c694, which created an EBS volume  was able to reboot the system several times shut down the system detached and took a snapshot of the EBS volume registered it as an AMI launched an instance of the new AMI (in a new AZ)   However, the new instance can't boot. The system log is at the bottom of this post.  Googling for this error turns up some potentially relevant threads about bugs in Ubuntu...  https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=libudev:+udev_monitor_new_from_netlink:+error+getting+socket:+Invalid+argument  ...but I'm not sure this is the problem - the strange thing is that I could (re-)boot the original instance fine, just not my AMI in a new instance.

16763,Amazon EC2 V3,- registered it as an AMIDid you specify the correct AKI and ARI when you register the new AMI on that region?
16763,Amazon EC2 V3,"I wasn't even aware of those, thanks. I tried specifying the same AKI as the original ami-d197c694, aki-c397c686 (the ramdisk was just 'ebs', which was the what the AMI was already set to, so I left that unspecified). Now I see more progress from the system console, but for some reason, I can't connect to ssh port 22. I verified that the instance is running in the default security group, which has ssh access.  2010-07-15T04:41:03+0000 [    0.000000] Initializing cgroup subsys cpuset [    0.000000] Initializing cgroup subsys cpu [    0.000000] Linux version 2.6.32-305-ec2 (buildd@yellow) (gcc version 4.4.3 (Ubuntu 4.4.3-4ubuntu5) ) #9-Ubuntu SMP Thu Apr 15 08:05:38 UTC 2010 (Ubuntu 2.6.32-305.9-ec2 2.6.32.11+drm33.2) [    0.000000] Command line:  root=/dev/sda1 ro 4 [    0.000000] KERNEL supported cpus: [    0.000000]   Intel GenuineIntel [    0.000000]   AMD AuthenticAMD [    0.000000]   Centaur CentaurHauls [    0.000000] Xen-provided physical RAM map: [    0.000000]  Xen: 0000000000000000 - 00000001e0800000 (usable) [    0.000000] last_pfn = 0x1e0800 max_arch_pfn = 0x80000000 [    0.000000] last_pfn = 0x100000 max_arch_pfn = 0x80000000 [    0.000000] init_memory_mapping: 0000000000000000-0000000100000000 [    0.000000] NX (Execute Disable) protection: active [    0.000000] init_memory_mapping: 0000000100000000-00000001e0800000 [    0.000000] NX (Execute Disable) protection: active [    0.000000] (4 early reservations) ==> bootmem [0000000000 - 01e0000000] [    0.000000]   #0 [0001830000 - 000274a000]     Xen provided ==> [0001830000 - 000274a000] [    0.000000]   #1 [0001000000 - 000180feb8]    TEXT DATA BSS ==> [0001000000 - 000180feb8] [    0.000000]   #2 [000274a000 - 0002f4f000]          PGTABLE ==> [000274a000 - 0002f4f000] [    0.000000]   #3 [0002f4f000 - 0003657000]          PGTABLE ==> [0002f4f000 - 0003657000] [    0.000000] Zone PFN ranges: [    0.000000]   DMA      0x00000000 -> 0x00001000 [    0.000000]   DMA32    0x00001000 -> 0x00100000 [    0.000000]   Normal   0x00100000 -> 0x001e0800 [    0.000000] Movable zone start PFN for each node [    0.000000] early_node_map[2] active PFN ranges [    0.000000]     0: 0x00000000 -> 0x001e0000 [    0.000000]     0: 0x001e0800 -> 0x001e0800 [    0.000000] NR_CPUS:64 nr_cpumask_bits:64 nr_cpu_ids:2 nr_node_ids:1 [    0.000000] PERCPU: Embedded 18 pages/cpu @ffff88000183c000 s44248 r8192 d21288 u73728 [    0.000000] pcpu-alloc: s44248 r8192 d21288 u73728 alloc=18*4096 [    0.000000] pcpu-alloc: [0] 0 [0] 1  [    0.000000] Built 1 zonelists in Zone order, mobility grouping on.

16762,Amazon EC2 V3,"Setting platform type of custom AMI I created a new custom AMI from a public Ubuntu AMI by following instructions provided by Amazon. However, I was surprised to see that the new AMI is listed as ""Other Linux"" for its platform type instead of Ubuntu as I would expect. Did I miss anything in the process?I seem to remember that the first custom AMI created based on the Ubuntu AMI does come up as for Ubuntu platform. But further customization of the AMI is now showing up as for ""Other Linux"". Not sure what I've missed. Has anyone experienced this same problem?"

16761,Amazon EC2 V3,"Instance wouldn't reboot, now stuck in ""stopping"" state for > 1 hour We have an EBS-backed large instance (i-9562c2fe) in us-east-1b that is not responding to a stop request.  It has been in a ""stopping"" state for > 1 hour now. The initial stop command was issued via the web console, and I've repeated it a couple more times via the command line tools, but with no change in state.  We're actually trying to reboot the instance - but the initial reboot command didn't work either (although it did appear to complete and move back to a running state - but the instance was non-responsive).  This is our standby database for our production system so we really need to get this back on line ASAP!"
16761,Amazon EC2 V3,"In the absence of anyone replying or assisting, I thought I'd update people on what we did.  After 12 hours of being in a ""stopping"" state and numerous attempts to stop it, I re-ran the stop-instance command using the --force option.  This had no immediate effect, but by this morning it had finally stopped. Whether this was the --force, AWS catching up, or an admin doing something I'll never know.  However, to work around the issue while this was happening I snapshotted every volume and created a new image from the snapshots using the ec2-register command.   I then brought up the new instance without issue. Certainly reinforces the value of EBS backed AMI's.  This was clearly a problem with AWS - it would have been nice to have some acknowledgement of the problem.  I'm going to start the old instance back up to see if I can discern what might have gone wrong to cause the reboot in the first place."

16758,Amazon EC2 V3,"Slow initial response times on instance Hi,I am running a couple of websites off of a small Linux instance. Both sites are rails applications using Passenger and REE. The instance works great, however the problem is when you first hit the server - say after restarting one of the apps or the browser - there is always a solid 10-20s delay before you can get a page to load. Once it does finally load everything is responsive, but obviously that initial wait is an issue. It seems like  a DNS problem, but I can't imagine why both would react in the same way.The public DNS for the instance is <span class=""value"">ec2-184-73-216-231.compute-1.amazonaws.com.

16757,Amazon EC2 V3,"rpmforge/rpmfusion on Linux AMI I need to get some trivial stuff working (davfs2/fusedav/...) that's not in the repos for the Official Linux AMI. Tried to add rpmfusion or rpmforge but not much luck.  I figure making a conscious decision to add those repos (as the Linux AMI are RH based, no?) should provide the flexibility you might expect from a cloud. In stead I am back in dependency tracking, configure/make/build.... and considering a ready-made Ubuntu server image or so - at least they have partner repos.  Anyway: has anybody found a way to extend the standard repos for the Linux AMIs to make them a bit more useable?"
16757,Amazon EC2 V3,"It looks like for davfs2 has a dependency on libneon.  We have upgraded the version of libneon in the existing repo.  We are working on getting a rhel5 compatible version of the neon library to include in the repo, as well."

I can open an EBS account if images of Instance-Store instances can be stored to EBS. If they can be directly stored to S3, it is even better."
16753,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hyperion ami-b13bd0d8 image Hi all,I'm trying to use a Public AIM with Hyperion system installed on it. I'm able to launch the instance but I can't access it via Remote Desktop because the Windows admin password is not generated.

16752,Amazon EC2 V3,Intermittent smtp connection timeout issues. I am new to this platform. I have 4  ami Large instances(3 Linux and 1 windows 2003R2) used as smtp servers. I have noticed they all are having intermittent connection timeout issues when either receiving or sending emails. It make no difference the size of the messages either(2Kb or 2MB).  Has anyone seen this before? Your inputs is high appreciated.  Thanks
16752,Amazon EC2 V3,"I've been experiencing problems with SMTP out to our SMTP relay service since yesterday. I don't host mail servers on EC2, this is just SMTP out customer support email.  Yesterday we switched to using an alternate port (not 25) which seemed to clear up the problem. Then this morning we had the same problem happen for awhile. Eventually it fixed itself.  The problem only happens on EC2 instances, our other servers can talk to the relay service fine. The route to the relay service from EC2 seems fine as well. I'm pretty much at a loss as to what is happening."

16749,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi, I wish I could help, but I'm not. All I can do is tell you what I'm doing, but the truth is I'm not sure I'm doing the right thing, since the problem keep coming back.  I usually try those solution in that order: 1. Wait for few minutes 2. Restart the instnace 3. Restart the instance again (and again). 4. Stop the instance, detach the EBS volume, create new instance and attach my volume to the new instance (sometime it helps, but it takes time so it can be that the problem just fix itself).  For example, yesterday I was able to RDP to my server but then the RDP session froze. When I disconnect and reconnect it just return to frozen session but disconnect and wait 3 minutes and reconnect again and it all works.  I'm in the same problem as you and I've start look for alternatives to ec2 since it scare me to put production server there and tell me clients ""you have to wait an hour or a day because I can't reach you server"".  Hope it help, Ido"
16749,Amazon EC2 V3,"To Ido,A couple of things:You mention instanceId i-db560ab0 and that you had issues right after you launched it, but that it was reproducible ""every time"" you connected over RDP.  Are you only experiencing the problem within the first few minutes after starting it?  Are you only trying to connect after the console says ""Windows ready to use""?I ask because that instance appears to only be running for about 23 minuntes, and I am wondering if  you realize that, by default, the host reboots itself within a few minutes after a stop/start in order to change its name?  Depending on the software you have running on that host, that could be the heart of the problem with that instance (though you initial problem at the start of the thread may not be related).Also, When your instance stops responding, have you tried connecting over RDP (or http) from another running instance in order to test whether you are having some sort of issue from you particular site to that IP address?  The fact that you don't see any indications of a ""crash"" in the eventlogs, but everything ""freezes"" when you connect suggests a few things:1) There is some sort of problem from your location to the instance IP you are trying to connect to2) Some software on your instance is crashing or otherwise distrubing the network stack.Trying to connect to the unresponsive instance from another instance will help at least determine whether there's a problem from your location. Beyond that, you will have to experiement with enabling/disabling Windows 2008 tcp optimizations and see if there is an incompatibility with your application.  Using a network analyzer like Microsoft's NetMon (free) will allow you to monitor networking conditions.  You might also log performance data inside your instance and anaylze it for processes which may be using excessive CPU, etc.  I believe only more detailed forensics will get to the bottom of this."
16749,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi, First I'm glad to get an official response to this problem.  I didn't try to connect from another instance. I'll do that next time it happen (I'm afraid there will be a next time).  When I wrote the message, it was happen every time. The next day RDP worked but not perfectly. It got stuck and disconnecting and waiting for few minutes seem to resolve the issue.  I don't have anything that should take a lot of memory or CPU but I'll have perf-mon keep track of it.  The thing that scare me the most is that those problem mysteriously appear and mysteriously disappear which led me to believe it's not a problem of my instance. Also there are numerous people all complain about problem related to RDP/SSH problems.  You know you have the best cloud-server-service at the moment. I just wish you'll have closer support (and please don't advice to buy support for price higher than the price of the instances I use).  Thank you very much, Ido."
16749,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi Ryan,Can you please help me as well. My <span>EC2 Instance is</span> <span class=""keys"">i-1755127c - i am not able to RD to this instance. Could you please help us in sorting this out.Thanks,Newt111</span>"
16749,Amazon EC2 V3,"Ido:We appreciate your feedback.  Unfortunately, diagnosing one RDP/SSH connection to the next is not always straightforward as, being both an internet-accessible service and a hosting service which provides no restrictions on the software which you may install on the instance, there are many, many possible culprits to any given connection problem... some detectable only from within the instance, other within an ISP, etc...  Hopefully, some more detailed forensics and maybe application level diagnostics from within the instance can help narrow down the problem.Other things which may help narrow down the issue are to allow your instances to respond to ICMP and attempt various traceroute methods to your instance, and also disable any/all TCP optimizations (including ones which are turned on by default in Windows 2008), as not all applications  may respond well to these in the context of EC2. newt111:Are you still experiencing the problem?  I am able to get a network challenge from various access points when hitting the RDP port on your instance."

16749,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi, The problem has happen again, I cannot RDP into my instance ( i-db560ab0) yet I have HTTP connection to it, although it is very slow.  I've launch another machine and I am able to RDP from the second instance (i-5399b338) into the first using the Private DNS address.  I understand it means that the instance itself is OK and there is a communication problem, can you help me understand what it is?  I did not change the security group.  Thank you, Ido."
16749,Amazon EC2 V3,"Firstly, if you have both instances set up to allow them to respond to pings, you should do a traceroute to both hosts to help you determine whether there is some high-level routing issue between your client and 2 instances.  Compare the output, which should be very similar, to try to deduce whether your ISP is at fault, or some hop along the way.  This often not conclusive, but a good place to start.You should also use 'netstat' to determine whether there is a socket in a wait state from the source address/port from which you were trying to connect (also noting whether your client appears to connect from the same IP and Port every time).  On the instance having the issues, you should use a tool like Microsoft's NetMon to analyze the RDP traffic coming in from your client.  Do you see any packets on TCP port 3389 coming from your source IP when you try to connect?  What is occuring?  Using the same tool on your client, do you evidence of a TCP conversation, or is it going into a black hole?"

So as I said it happen again, and I was able to RDP from my second machine (i-5399b338) into the first (i-db560ab0).  I'll start from the end - I've restart the Terminal Services service on the first node and it solve the problem, I was able once again to RDP from my local computer both of the EC2 machines.

16735,Amazon EC2 V3,"Using Spot Instance 24/7? Will this work? Is it allowed? Hi all,  Just started seriously considering an EC2 Micro instance for some low traffic web stuff (like my blog, and some mobile games high score apps).  I was reading about Spot Instances, and wondered whether or not it's possible to save some cash by using them, with a fairly high bid. It seems likely that over a year, the average spot price would be below the on-demand price.  So, if I set a bid of slightly higher than the on-demand price, is there any reason my spot instance wouldn't run 24/7, but cost me a lot less?  I understand there are a few things that might cause my instance to be terminated (others bidding higher, resources taken by non-spot instances, spot price increasing), but I can live with a little downtime (or having to boot an on-demand instance) now and then.  Is there a flaw in this plan?  I've seen that some spot prices are already higher than on-demand prices, but in general, this doesn't appear to be the case (and I don't understand how spot instances would be useful if this became the norm)."

16729,Amazon EC2 V3,"Unreliable Service: Four Failed Instances I've managed to break four instances over the past couple weeks and I have absolutely no idea how. Once the instances fail no connections can be established, Remote Desktop, HTTP and HTTPS connection requests all fail and I am absolutely blind to what is going in. The System Logs report nothing useful and the status of my instance remains as ""Running"". I've asked for help on these forums in another thread but so far I've been given no useful information.  This last time I tried creating and setting up an instance step by step so I could determine the issue. After making some changes several days ago I double checked that I could establish a remote desktop connection. As it was successful I went ahead and created an AMI from the instance... now it's dead and I can't establish a remote desktop connection. Something about the bundling process broke my instance. The ID is: i-61684e0b  I run a few physical servers in my local area and I have another instance running that I created over a year ago that's running fine. I am not causing these issues. Something is wrong on Amazon's end and I'm tried of trying to figure out what it is. I am seriously considering switching to another provider that can give me better support and doesn't want me to pay them $100 so they can resolve an issue with their system."
16729,Amazon EC2 V3,I've managed to break four instances over the past couple weeks and I have absolutely no idea how.  I am not causing these issues.  Those seem like contradictory statements.  Sorry you're having trouble but we've been running a number of machines for over a year with only one failure that was Amazon's fault.
16729,Amazon EC2 V3,"The instance I created well over a year ago using a Windows 2003 image is working fine too. But any new instances I create inevitably crash.  What I meant to say is that I am not doing anything that _should_ cause these instances to crash and since I'm blind once it happens there's little I can do to diagnose the problem any further.  I just explained what killed the last instance. Everything was running fine, I bundled the instance and now it's dead. What would you suggest I do now?"
16729,Amazon EC2 V3,"Ah, I don't have much (well, any) experience with Windows on EC2, only Linux. Are you using the S3/instance-store AMIs? If so, maybe you could try using an EBS-backed AMI instead. This way you could snapshot it regularly, and even after the crash, then attach that volume elsewhere for a postmortem."
16729,Amazon EC2 V3,It is EBS and that's exactly what I tried to do and exactly what caused the issue.
16729,Amazon EC2 V3,I had the same problems as you.  Two things I found that were causing problems was applying the latest service pack for SQL Express 2008 and assigning an SSL certificate to a website.  Both issues took a while to diagnose and someone else posted the solution to the SSL problem.  I agree that these were both not activities that would have cause any problems on a standard windows install but did on EC2.
16729,Amazon EC2 V3,Yes! I'm assigning an SSL cert to my website. Thank you for the info!

16728,Amazon EC2 V3,"Instance became unresponsive, not rebooting, and now hangs trying to stop We have a ""t1.micro"" instance ""i-634a7009"" which became unresponsive some time today. When we noticed it, we tried to reboot it. The reboot command took only a couple of seconds to execute, which was suspiciously quick, and as we suspected, the reboot did not make the instance responsive again. We resorted to stopping the instance, and after issuing the stop command, the instance just hangs in the stopping status for about an hour now. It seems a similar issue also had happened to another person who also posted before us. We need to take down and bring the instance back asap. Thanks."

I'll do all you requested on the southeast instance soon.ThanksFred--------------------------------------------------------------[ec2-user@ip-10-160-51-57 ~]$ sudo yum clean allLoaded plugins: fastestmirror, securityCleaning up EverythingCleaning up list of fastest mirrors[ec2-user@ip-10-160-51-57 ~]$ sudo yum search tomcatLoaded plugins: fastestmirror, securityDetermining fastest mirrorsCould not retrieve mirrorlist http://repo.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/amzn-v0.9/mirror.list error was14: HTTP Error 404 : http://repo.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/amzn-v0.9/mirror.listError: Cannot find a valid baseurl for repo: amzn[ec2-user@ip-10-160-51-57 ~]$ yum search tomcatLoaded plugins: fastestmirror, securityhttp://49313b5a-38bf-459a-ad08-f7e3cb7db8e8.s3.amazonaws.com/amzn-v0.9/i386/repodata/repomd.xml: [Errno 14] HTTP Error 404 : http://49313b5a-38bf-459a-ad08-f7e3cb7db8e8.s3.amazonaws.com/amzn-v0.9/i386/repodata/repomd.xmlTrying other mirror.============================================================== Matched: tomcat ==============================================================apache-tomcat-apis.noarch : Tomcat Servlet and JSP APIstomcat6-admin-webapps.noarch : The host-manager and manager web applications for Apache Tomcattomcat6-docs-webapp.noarch : The docs web application for Apache Tomcattomcat6-javadoc.noarch : Javadoc generated documentation for Apache Tomcattomcat6-jsp-2.1-api.noarch : Apache Tomcat JSP API implementation classestomcat6-lib.noarch : Libraries needed to run the Tomcat Web containertomcat6-servlet-2.5-api.noarch : Apache Tomcat Servlet API implementation classestomcat6-webapps.noarch : The ROOT and examples web applications for Apache Tomcatjakarta-commons-collections-tomcat5.noarch : Jakarta Commons Collection dependency for Tomcat5tomcat6.noarch : Apache Servlet/JSP Engine, RI for Servlet 2.5/JSP 2.1 APItomcat6-log4j.noarch : Log4J support for Apache Tomcatjakarta-commons-dbcp-tomcat5.noarch : DBCP dependency for Tomcat5jakarta-commons-pool-tomcat5.noarch : Pool dependency for Tomcat5tomcat6-el-1.0-api.noarch : Expression Language v1.0 API[ec2-user@ip-10-160-51-57 ~]$ yum clean allLoaded plugins: fastestmirror, securityCleaning up EverythingCleaning up list of fastest mirrorsTraceback (most recent call last):  File ""/usr/bin/yum"", line 29, in <module>    yummain.user_main(sys.argv[1:], exit_code=True)  File ""/usr/share/yum-cli/yummain.py"", line 254, in user_main    errcode = main(args)  File ""/usr/share/yum-cli/yummain.py"", line 109, in main    result, resultmsgs = base.doCommands()  File ""/usr/share/yum-cli/cli.py"", line 357, in doCommands    return self.yum_cli_commands[self.basecmd].doCommand(self, self.basecmd, self.extcmds)  File ""/usr/share/yum-cli/yumcommands.py"", line 560, in doCommand    return base.cleanCli(extcmds)  File ""/usr/share/yum-cli/cli.py"", line 971, in cleanCli    self.plugins.run('clean')  File ""/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/yum/plugins.py"", line 177, in run    func(conduitcls(self, self.base, conf, **kwargs))  File ""/usr/lib/yum-plugins/fastestmirror.py"", line 121, in clean_hook    os.unlink(hostfilepath)OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/var/cache/yum/i386/1/timedhosts.txt'[ec2-user@ip-10-160-51-57 ~]$ yum search tomcatLoaded plugins: fastestmirror, securityCould not retrieve mirrorlist http://repo.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/amzn-v0.9/mirror.list error was14: HTTP Error 404 : http://repo.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/amzn-v0.9/mirror.listError: Cannot retrieve repository metadata (repomd.xml) for repository: amzn.

16715,Amazon EC2 V3,"Difficulty of finding an EBS based AMI with Java+Tomcat I've just finished setting up a Tomcat server on EC2.  I found remarkably difficult to obtain an appropriate AMI.  I thought I'd describe my experience here, in case it's useful for others and/or someone can suggest a better approach.  First there is the question of whether to use an EBS or S3 based machine image.  I want to use EBS, for two reasons.  First, I can modify the filesystem and expect my changes to survive a machine failure.  Second, http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/DeveloperGuide/index.html?ComponentsAMIs.html lists a number of benefits for EBS images, such as faster boot time and the ability to switch to a different instance type.  However, there are relatively few EBS-based AMIs available.  Amazon provides ami-84db39ed (fedora-8-i386-v1.14-std) and ami-86db39ef (amazon/fedora-8-x86_64-v1.14-std), but these are based on Fedora 8 which is two and half years old.  They are also very minimalist -- they don't include Java, let alone Tomcat.  Using the AWS console to browse other images seems hopeless, as the console provides virtually no information about the images.  And I haven't found many useful pointers to specific AMIs on the web.  This is compounded by the fact that, for security reasons, I'm very reluctant to use an AMI that's not provided by Amazon.  I found a few threads on converting an S3 AMI to an EBS AMI, e.g.:  http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/thread.jspa?messageID=156552&#156552 http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/thread.jspa?messageID=156323&#156323  But it sounds cumbersome.  And even with S3 AMIs, finding a good starting AMI still seems difficult.  For instance, http://ttlnews.blogspot.com/2009/01/setting-up-amazon-ami-with-java-and.html identifies an AMI with Java, but it is based on ""the publicly available Java Web Starter AMI"" (http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=1993&categoryID=101), which seems to be over two years old (the linked page lists no updates after ""2008-01-08: Initial release"").  And based on the comments on that blog posting, it seems to have some issues -- e.g. ""The 1.7 version of java has issues loading keys from a keystore. This functionality is necessary for configuring tomcat to run with https.  The only solution that I have found for this problem, so far, is to replace java 1.7 with a sun version of the jdk (1.6).""  I finally started with ami-84db39ed and installed Java and Tomcat manually.  It took me several hours of searching to figure out how to install Java -- the web is full of instructions which don't work on Fedora, or are otherwise inapplicable.  Eventually I found http://alwajdi.blogspot.com/2007/12/how-to-install-snns-jdk-in-fedora-8.html, which worked after downloading a JDK RPM from http://download.java.net/jdk6/.  In summary, my question is: how does one identify an AMI which is trustworthy, appropriate to one's task, and reasonably recent?  If anyone is interested, I can write up a HOWTO detailing the process by which I set up an EBS-based EC2 instance with Java and Tomcat, and installed my application on it."
16715,Amazon EC2 V3,"Steve,You can find recent and community tested Ubuntu  AMI's at http://www.alestic.com Eric and the rest of  ec2-ubuntu google group have the great support too.  For converting instance store to EBS AMI,this might be helpful also: http://www.capsunlock.net/2009/12/create-ebs-boot-ami.htmlCheers,Rodney http://www.capsunlock.net"
16715,Amazon EC2 V3,"Steve,You said:| In summary, my question is: how does one identify | an AMI which is trustworthy, appropriate to one's| task, and reasonably recent?Very good question!  I agree that the set of existing AMI's is very hard to search.  I'm currently looking for an official Amazon (or otherwise trustworthy) EBS-based CentOS AMI.  How to search?  The best I've seen is to choose ""EBS Instances"" from the ""Viewing"" drop down list while choosing an AMI in the ""Request Instances Wizard"" of the AWS Console, and then click the ""Platform"" column header to sort by platform, so that Cent OS comes to the top.  That shows 5 of them:   ami-1d10fd74   ami-59739e30   ami-6b608c02   ami-75b8571c   ami-77b8571ebut how do I learn details of each of these to choose among them?  You also said:| If anyone is interested, I can write up a HOWTO| detailing the process by which I set up an EBS-based| EC2 instance with Java and Tomcat, and installed | my application on it.        Yes, please.  Meanwhile, you and others can view thestep-by-step instructions I've written for the various AWS tasks I've accomplished at:    http://bristle.com/Tips/CloudComputing.htm#awsYou asked how to install Java on a Fedora instance.For me, it was easy, using yum to find and install it.Simply:% yum list installed | grep -i java    - To see that Java was not yet installed.% yum list | grep -i java | grep -i -v javadoc    - To see what was available, skipping the javadoc stuff% yum info ""*java-1.7*""    - To learn more about those that seemed promising% yum -v install java-1.7.0-icedtea    - To install the Java 1.7 runtime% yum -v install java-1.7.0-icedtea-devel    - To install the Java 1.7 compiler and tools Hope this helps!--Fred Stluka"
16715,Amazon EC2 V3,"Rodney -- thanks for the pointers.  I'll check out alestic if/when it's time to move on from the Fedora 8 setup I've managed to get working.  Fred -- I like how you're compiling instructions, that looks like a nice resource.   I can't quite remember why ""yum"" didn't work out for me.  I think I'd decided that Java 1.7 was too cutting edge for my taste; for instance, see the comment regarding keystore in my initial posting on this thread.  That yum command you supply doesn't list a Java 1.6 package.  I've now published my Java+Tomcat setup instructions here:  http://sites.google.com/site/amistrongeryet/setting-up-java-tomcat-on-ec2  I believe this page should be publicly viewable; if not, let me know."
16715,Amazon EC2 V3,"Steve,Yes, the page is viewable.  Good stuff!  Thanks!--Fred"
16715,Amazon EC2 V3,"Thank you for validating that I'm not a total noob, not ignorant, and not crazy (well, okay, that this isn't further proof of insanity). I'm finding it EXTREMELY difficult to find an AMI to work from to set up my Grails application on a micro instance. Micro requires EBS instances, and there don't seem to be a lot of those. I can't figure out WHAT the heck is in the community AMIs because their descriptions are all in some alien language... certainly not detailed enough  to evoke trust from this programmer.My Linux skills are rudimentary at best, so I am now looking at using a Windows instance instead. blech."
16715,Amazon EC2 V3,"I think the best strategy is to start with a basic, minimal AMI like the official Amazon AMI or the Ubuntu Lucid AMI and install what you need on top of those. With the built-in package managers installing things like Tomcat and Java is trivial."
16714,Amazon EC2 V3,"Trouble starting stopped instance I stopped a large instance when I wasn't using it and I'm not trying to start it again to continue where I left off. In the status it says it's online with the green circle, but I can't get a response to it. I reassigned the same reserved IP address after it started and I haven't touched the associated EBS volumes that were mounted. The server is Ubuntu 10.4 based off of ami-1634de7f in us-east1.   At first the get system log shows nothing, even well after the server status says online. But waiting 5-10 minutes I finally get the following log you see below. I have seen this when an expected EBS volume is missing, but again I haven't touched the two associated EBS volumes and they both say green, in-use, attached.

16709,Amazon EC2 V3,The documentation is very sparse but I believe that the purpose of the block device mapping parameter to the RunInstance request is to define which ephemeral drives get mapped to which linux device.  It is not possible to use it to automatically map EBS drives at launch time.Mitch

16709,Amazon EC2 V3,"Come across this explanation from http://ja.pastebin.ca/1502048 -B, --block-device-mapping MAPS  Default block-device-mapping scheme to launch the AMI with. This scheme defines how block devices may be exposed to an EC2 instance of this AMI if the instance-type of the instance is entitled to the specified device. The scheme is a comma-separated list of key=value pairs, where each key is a ""virtual-name"" and each value, the corresponding native device name desired. Possible virtual-names are:- ""ami"": denotes the root file system device, as seen by the instance.- ""root"": denotes the root file system device, as seen by the kernel.- ""swap"": denotes the swap device, if present.- ""ephemeralN"": denotes Nth ephemeral store; N is a non-negative integer.Note that the contents of the AMI form the root file system. Samples of block-device-mappings are:- ""ami=sda1,root=/dev/sda1,ephemeral0=sda2,swap=sda3""- ""ami=<span class=""nu0"">0</span>,root=/dev/dsk/c0d0s0,ephemeral0=<span class=""nu0"">1</span>"""

16709,Amazon EC2 V3,"Are you using one of the Amazon Linux beta AMIs?  If so, this is a known issue.  The EBS volumes work fine, but are not named as expected.  The ""doesn't contain a valid partition table"" is a correct message, because you are starting with a raw disk.  You can either format the whole disk using mkfs or partition it and then format using parted or fdisk."
16709,Amazon EC2 V3,"Thank you Peter. I appreciate your response. I have hunted extensively for this information and could not find it as a know issue.  Yes, this is a linux instance. If linux instances are using the Windows device names, it would have saved me a few hours if Amazon had included this in their documentation.  I continue to receive the ""doesn't contain a valid partition table"" after mkfs. Are you saying this should change after formatting?  The partition I am moving from a older RackSpace CentOS instance was using xfs and I had trouble getting the xfsprogs into the new Amazon distribution, so thought I might be having a problem with either the old volume or the xfs, so I also created a new volume and formated it with ext3 and it also reports ""doesn't contain a valid partition table"".

16704,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi thereThank you for the forum post. I have looked into your configuration and can confirm that your instance has encountered a file system error. The issue here is that as you have selected an ""instance-store"" image, there is no way for you to detach your root volume, and attach it to a new instance to run the fsck through to completion.I would recommend that you terminate this instance, and launch a new instance which uses EBS volumes for its' root device. This will allow you to take regular snapshots of your data and configuration, and also in the event of a filesystem problem such as this, you will be able to detach the volume, and attach to another instance to run maintenance. I'm sorry that we can't be of more assistance. For future reference, please post the instance ID of the impacted instance, and we will endeavor to assist you as quickly as possible.Best wishes,"

16698,Amazon EC2 V3,Is your Windows Micro instance extremly unresponsive? I used one of my own AMI's to create a new micro instance. The moment I try to remove any IIS7 features (I removed directory browsing and logging tools) it takes hours for windows to complete the request. Once it does and I reboot the instance from within Windows it does not come back online (I have been waiting for 45 minutes and it has never taken this long before). Granted I have only used standard instances before but the websites on the instance experience very low traffic so it made sense to move them to micro instances.Is anyone else experiencing these response times? This is not acceptable for me but I need to understand if this is just the nature of the micro instance or anything else going on before I evaluate actions.P.S. I have another micro instance that I created from the same AMI that seems to be working just fine. Then again I am hesitant to add/remove any IIS7 features to test since I run the risk of taking the entire server down and have angry clients calling meThankful for any input on this.Thanks

16696,Amazon EC2 V3,"SLA for Durability Hi,  I wonder if Amazon provides durability for in-memory data. I have gone through Amazon EC2 SLA but could not find any statement about the durability of in-memory data.

For example, I would like to rent 1000 of machines to run my application. It is a highly-coupled application, all data are stored in main-memory for high performance, any data loss will cause my application to restart from the beginning.

16685,Amazon EC2 V3,".NET's Stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds is wrong on EC2 Hi   I've just set off a data import job on a high memory extra large instance on Windows, which is a .NET 3.5 command line application which is taking hundreds of thousands of XML files and putting them in an SQL Server database.  This application has real-time logging, including measuring the time certain operations take to complete.  This uses the .NET Stopwatch class from System.Diagnostics, specifically Stopwatch.StartNew() and Stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds.  On my own hardware, this works as expected, returning the correct times.  On EC2, the values for ElapsedMilliseconds are about 10 times too high. (i.e. an operation that completes in about 10 seconds is being reported as taking, say, 111232ms. But only on EC2.)  Any idea why this might be the case?  Thanks Tom"

We don't want to pay for multiple instances just to have additional IPs, but each SSL cert requires a unique IP.Thanks"
16683,Amazon EC2 V3,"There is no way to assign more than one IP to an instance, however you can use a multiple domain UCC SSL certificate which can be configured to support up to 100 domains in a single certificate.  Or as another option, you can assign each application it's own SSL port, such as 443, 900, 901, etc... (make sure not to use ports that are already reserved, like 445)  Then deploy a elastic load balancer for each individual site, set the load balancer to answer on port 80 and 443, but then deliver the traffic to the corresponding port you have configured for the SSL for that site in question. example HTTPS 443 on load balancer to HTTPS 900 on the instance."
16683,Amazon EC2 V3,"We don't want to pay for multiple instances just to have additional IPs, but each SSL cert requires a unique IP.

This is done and I have also updated the EC2 config file to persist changes. Problem is now I can't connect to my UNC paths on each instance using IP or computer name (after reboot). It seems they can't see each other anymore. I am using the same security group file.</div>Instead of computer name (which will only really work if you have a Domain Controller - not necessary), use the DNS name of the Elastic IP in your UNC path. Like this:\\ec2-1-2-3-4.amazonaws.com\SooperSeekritShare\file.txtYou *can* use the actual numerical Elastic IP address here, but that will incur a higher charge for traffic, and increase latency, since that traffic will exit and then re-enter EC2. When you use the DNS name of the Elastic IP from within EC2, it resolves to the private IP address of the associated instance."
16669,Amazon EC2 V3,"Thanks for your reply Shlomo.You answered both questions for me. #2 works great.As for #1, I have searched high and low for an example of how to configure the elastic ip address via a starup script for Windows Server 2008 (and 2003). How can I do this or where can I get an example? Must I use the command line API?Thanks for your input so far."

16669,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi !!  I've been looking for scripts solving that issue with the Elastic IP automatic attachment, but I was unable to find any ... Could you provide some hints about how to do that? Or maybe point me to the right tutorial on how to get a windows machine attaching to a particular Elastic IP on startup?  Many thanks and best regards!!  David"
16669,Amazon EC2 V3,"You can write some code in the language of your choice - python, ruby, Java - that uses any of the EC2 API libraries for that language to attach the Elastic IP to the current instance. You'll hook up this script to run during the boot sequence - that's something Windows-specific, and someone else may be able to help you with that.  You'll need to know the instance-id of the current instance. This can be retrieved by visiting this URL from within the instance: http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id"

16657,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi,Our documentation for mapping ephemeral storage describes doing so at run time:http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_OverridingAMIBDM.htmland the documentation for what can be modified on a stopped instance does not include ephemeral volume mapping:http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_ChangingAttributesWhileInstanceStopped.htmlTo my knowledge this is not supported, and I suspect that this is the reason that you are seeing this error message.  If you need to add storage to a running instance, I recommend that you provision additional EBS volumes; else you can create an AMI based on your instance, and launch a replacement from that AMI with a new block device mapping that addresses your ephemeral storage:http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/CommandLineReference/ApiReference-cmd-RunInstances.htmlHope this helps!-Jason"
16657,Amazon EC2 V3,"If this isn't supported, perhaps the documentation for the ModifyInstanceAttribute API call could specify that.  Even better would be if the API returned a sensible message.

16651,Amazon EC2 V3,Spot Request Remaining Open Over the past two months I have tried numerous times to launch spot requests using the console and have not been successful.  I have been launching these with max prices significantly higher than the spot price.  Several times I have left the request open for 24 hours with no response.  (I did manage to launch two instances shortly after the new pricing program was announced so I have been able to do this.)I would like to be able to use this but if I cannot reliably get instances then what is the point?Can anyone explain how spot requests are allocated and what I should do to improve my chances of getting one launched?
16651,Amazon EC2 V3,"I had a look at the Spot Instances requests for your account and I can see that a number of your Spot Requests did get instances.Also, most of your Spot Requests have an Availability Zone specified on them. Requests with additional constraints like these may remain unfulfilled even when the price on the request is more than the market price as it might not be possible to satisfy the additional constraints on the request."
16651,Amazon EC2 V3,Same thing happens to me now.Several of my requests did get fulfilled.New request that I try now (without zone restrictions) - don't get fulfilled...e.g sir-cafe8202.For some reason - it is mentioned that this request is for availability zone D - although I didn't specify I'm interested in availability zone D.Any idea?Eitan.
16651,Amazon EC2 V3,"Eitan,  Looking at our service, it looks like you submitted that bid on 2010-04-20 at 19:13 GMT.  I looked at all the bids you requested for that hour, and it looks like all of them had the AZ specified in the request (as us-east-1d).  Nadir"
16651,Amazon EC2 V3,"I am very surprised to read that SPOT instances may not be launched if Availability Zone is specified. I've just wasted more than 2 days trying to start a SPOT instance in EU, not understanding what happens.This makes the SPOT system extremely unreliable. Not only they may never launch if you happen to work in a particural AZ (gosh, I cannot launch it elsewhere as my EBS is in EU West 1B!) but SPOT  instances also tend to disappear without any reason ( see this disturbing thread: http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/thread.jspa?threadID=47486&tstart=0 ).This information should be much more clearly communicated at http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot-instances/ and also in the Console ... it should say that the SPOT is unlikely to open because there is too much (or too little?) demand etc.I have to add, reluctantly and with sadness, that without useful SPOT system AWS EC2 instantly becomes much less competitive to other cloud offers, notably from Rackspace Cloud."

16647,Amazon EC2 V3,"When is a new instance added to loadbalancer as ""in service""? Hi,I have a setup where I use elastic load balancing and auto scaling for a web frontend.What is the instance health, as seen by the load balancer, when auto scaling adds a new instance to the load balancer?My concern is that my frontend is quite slow at booting up, so I would like the instance to be ""out of service"" from the beginning and only get ""in service"" (and therefore receive requests from the load balancer) whenever the web server is ready.How should I configure the health check to get this behaviour?Best regards,Christian"
16647,Amazon EC2 V3,UNfortunately there is a bug in ELB that it assumes a newly-added instance is healthy until it fails the health check.  The workaround is to configure your health check to happen frequently enough that it minimizes the time the instance is in the load balancing pool before it's ready.
16647,Amazon EC2 V3,Do you know what the timeframe for this bug being fixed is?
16647,Amazon EC2 V3,"Instead of using autoscaling. Use the Cloudwatch directly and launch instances and add them to the loadbalancer through your 24x7 program till the bug gets fixed.  Aditya Yadav Partner, Aditya Yadav & Associates Author: Amazon Cloud Computing with C#/.Net Author: Amazon Cloud Computing with Java http://adityayadav.com/books.aspx"
16647,Amazon EC2 V3,Any news on this issue? Has the bug been fixed?
16647,Amazon EC2 V3,Not yet. It's still listed in the ELB Release Notes:  http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=3766&categoryID=86
16647,Amazon EC2 V3,"We are happy to report that this bug has been fixed recently. Now when a new instance is added to the load balancer via auto scaling the new instance will start off as ""unhealthy"" and transition to healthy only on the first successful ping.We will update the ELB release notes shortly."
16647,Amazon EC2 V3,"Subra,  Can you please clarify two things:  when a new instance is added to the load balancer via auto scaling  Does this apply only to instances added via auto-scaling - and instances added to an ELB by the ELB API will still initially show up as Healthy? Or will the instance now show up as UnHealthy at first, regardless of how it was added to the ELB?  and transition to healthy only on the first successful ping  Do you mean ""first successful health check""?"
16647,Amazon EC2 V3,"> Does this apply only to instances added via auto-scaling - andinstances added to an ELB by the ELB API will still initially show upas Healthy? Or will the instance now show up as UnHealthy at first,regardless of how it was added to the ELB?The latter.

Thank you for pointing that out."
16647,Amazon EC2 V3,On which date was the fix put into production in the Europe region?The release note page states that neither the Load balancer nor Auto scaling has been changed since 28/4-10:http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/kbcategory.jspa?categoryID=86

16645,Amazon EC2 V3,"Doubts about OpenVPN and IPv6 So, I was trying to configure a simple ""test"" OpenVPN network from a workstation (my, personal) to an instance.Even though I'm just an amateur on this, I was testing this aiming to use an AWS instance as a server to my own business ERP-like software, so I could have just simple workstations connected to the internet, each of them connected directly to the instance, in a multi-client / single server network.As I tried to start the server OpenVPN in the instance, it succeeded, but gave the following message: ""Need IPv6 code in mroute_extract_addr_from_packet"". I was not able to complete the connection from the workstation (even using the elastic IP).Do anybody know if it's actually possible to run the OpenVPN in an instance on that basis?

16645,Amazon EC2 V3,"Thanks, NOBODY!I found my solution on my own. That's not easy to an amateur on IT issues (actually, I'm an insurance broker).Just found out that OpenVPN version 2.2, a beta, suports IPv6 and AWS doesn't.

However, that s*** was as error in my log files and my software wasn't working, so I just had to discard that.Ok, version 2.1 installed, and then I had a lot of TLS Handshake problems. Again, nobody in the whole internet was offering a simple and straight solution, just everybody asking the same question about this. Hmmm... I found out that the problem was just that OpenVPN folks mislead everyboy in their ""HowTo""s and Examples. Their client config file simple example, included in their ""HowTo"" simples setup, has a configuration line that asks for a special kind of server authentication certificate, which a certificate created by their ""easy-rsa"" solution (also step-by-step in their ""HowTo"") would fail to comply.

16638,Amazon EC2 V3,"Volumes not showing up in /dev I've created a new instance of the Amazon Linux AMI and I am attempting to attach one of my EBS volumes as /dev/sdh.     The volume reports as attached in the Management Console, but there is no dev/sdh on the instance.   I thought it might be a timing issue, but it has not shown up in over 20 minutes.Is there another service I must run to recognize new devices?  The Amazon Linux instance is pretty lean."

16623,Amazon EC2 V3,"Ubuntu 8.04LTS - Instances Crashing Hi all, perhaps someone could shed some light on this. Our company has been running 3 - 4 instances (currently 3 large and 1 x-large) since January mostly without issues. In the last 24hours however I've had 3 of them lock up. 1 (the first to suffer a lockup) was rebooted 3 times and stayed up for about 5 min each time. I terminated and recreated the instance and it has not crashed since. However 2 others (all large) instances have crashed within a few hours later. These other two appear to be running fine after a single reboot.Note: that no system software has been upgraded on any of these recently.Description of crash: at times I was able to ping the instances but ssh nor any other services would work. In a couple of cases I was not even able to ping the instance.Details:1st Instance to crash: Current instance id of i-91e0d9fb (Large) - this is the one that I had to terminate and reboot as it would not stay up for more than 5 minutes after a reboot.2nd Instance to crash: Current instance id of i-08bc8e60 (Large) - crashed once and a reboot seems to have restored it.3rd Instance to crash: Current instance id of i-dfce1bb5  (Large) - crashed once and a reboot seems to have restored it.4th Instance: i-00a59968 (X-Large) - has not crashed and has been running with only a single reboot since January.All 4 are based off of the same AMI (ami-ef836f86) - ""Linux db2 2.6.21.7-2.fc8xen #1 SMP Fri Feb 15 12:34:28 EST 2008 x86_64 GNU/Linux"" which is based on AMI ami-5346a73a. Additionally all are running in the us-east-1 availability zone.The last instance to crash reported a kernel panic which I was able to find (Attached Below).I'm sort of at a loss to explain this as we have not altered any system software.

16621,Amazon EC2 V3,"Problem using S3FS I'm trying to mount an S3 bucket using S3FS on a basic Fedora instance, but am having some problems.I have managed to download all the build dependencies forS3FS and make it. It even runs without reporting any error when I mount an S3 bucket. However, a simple ls of /mnt/mybucket just hangs the console window. I can't Ctrl-C or do anything which stops it. I see that S3FS is a bit rough around the edges with error handling but it's hard to work out what's going wrong.The only reason I want to access my S3 bucket is to grab a tarball, unarchive it and then put the esulting files (about a million small ones) back onS3. Is there a better way to do this?Cheers,Warren"

16608,Amazon EC2 V3,"SMTP port 25 speed throttling? We're operating a mail server cluster in EC2, which is suffering from serious transmission speed degradation over port 25 when connections originate internationally (e.g. from New Zealand or Australia). This is causing severe delays to larger emails, typically with 5-10MB attachments. We urgently need to reassure our customers that no ""packet shaping"" or ""connection throttling"" is happening at the Amazon network, since this issue is causing service cancellations, e.g. after someone emails their boss a critical PowerPoint presentation for the Board Meeting in an hour. Which never arrives. We note that a 1MB file takes 45-60 seconds to transmit into an EC2 instance from NZ via port 22 or 80, but takes 4-5 minutes over SMTP. Someone is messing with TCP/IP connection speed, somewhere... not a Good Thing.Please tell us it ain't so...!"

16606,Amazon EC2 V3,"ELB says my working server is unhealthy, please advise? I am trying to add an ELB to my server, but it keeps saying that the server is unhealthy, although it is healthy and accessible. The server is available http://184.72.46.36/ and I set the path to ""/"". What URL is the ELB actually pinging? And do I need to setup a special security group on the EC2 instance for the ELB? Why isn't the ping working?thanks,-matt  Message was edited by: votizen"
16606,Amazon EC2 V3,Figured it out. The ELB was pinging from an IP address that the instance was block. Seems like AWS should automatically set up this permission for you.
16605,Amazon EC2 V3,"Can not launch any instances. I am a very new customer to EC2.I am trying to Launch a Micro instance in  <span>EU West (Ireland)</span>  region.I have setup a EC2 key-pair, the private key is in a folder on my computer.I setup a firewall policy while i was doing this the first time.I have tried it with tags and without (for me i will not need any tagging).I even went so far as to RTFM and followed the tutorial (i am not so new to this that i felt i had to read it until i could not get a single instance to launch).So when i get to the final confirmation screen, i press the Launch button, it changes to ""working"" with the swirling graphic... i never get to another screen it always stays on the same screen and the button just reverts to Launch again after a couple of seconds.I have tried it in FF 3.6.10 and IE 8, same thing in each browser.I have attached a screen-shot of the instance confirmation page... there are no errors and i followed the very simple tutorial and even went so far as making another new pair and another new simple security group just as the tutorial instructed me. I even tried to make a small instance instead of micro as the tutorial told me to, and i chose the AMI that the tutorial instructed me to.I also attached a screeny of my EC2 Console.Any help anyone can give me on this issue would be very valuable."
16605,Amazon EC2 V3,Hi thereI have not seen this problem before do you have any personal firwalls or popup blockers that may be effecting the operation of your computers browsers. I would also suggest that if you can try another computer at your end to see if you are still having the same issue.
16605,Amazon EC2 V3,"No personal firewalls or blockers.Different computer, same thing.I feel it has something to do with all the security checks and so forth that were done to my account, i can do everything else in the console, i made a bucket and setup cloudfront to serve from that bucket.I have good fast internet and modern computers,"
16605,Amazon EC2 V3,"Seeing as i have no active instances, and no old instances... maybe can you un-enroll me from the EC2 system and then i can subscribe again and maybe that might force this error away."
16605,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi thereI have checked your account and it all looks ok. This is a technical issue so I would not suggest unsubscribe you account as I feel this may cause billing problems further down the line.The AWS client is heavily dependent of Javascript could you make sure that your systems do not have Antivirus or Security suites effecting how your browsers  execute javascript. If you could do all the basic troubling shooting steps clearing browser cache, clearing out cookies and retry loading the client again.Another suggestion I have is that you start Firefox in Safemode which will stop all plugins and addons when you start it up just to see if  this helps.In windows you can just edit your firefox shortcut on the desktop and after the last "" add -safe-modeFailing all of this you could try the ElasticFox which is a add-on client to the Firefox browser for EC2.I have launched an instance in EU-West using the Fedora core 8 32 t1.micro image based of the following ami (ami-df1e35ab) with no issues if you want to try it"
16605,Amazon EC2 V3,"Well i tried ElasticFox... It did give me some real information, that your website console refused to give me.See attached screen-shot.Also ElasticFox does not support micro instances,"
16605,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi alanjones2010,I looked into your EC2 access and took action to reset the account.  This does not require any further action on your part but should correct the issue of not being able to launch instances.  Can you confirm if you are still unable to launch instances?Best Regards, Michelle"
16605,Amazon EC2 V3,"I can now run an instance.I just wish i had not wasted an entire day when your system could simply have displayed me an error.Considering i was in need of a server on the 11th when i came and now it is the 22nd, pretty sad stuff AWS."

16604,Amazon EC2 V3,"Create image (EBS AMI) not working In the console, I created a image of a running instance.  Then I went to my new AMI, right clicked, and launched an instance.  However, after connecting to the new instance, none of my changes from the running instance were included in the ""cloned"" instance.Isn't this supposed to work?Also, I did not realize when you create an AMI from an instance, it shuts down that instance!  It makes sense, but the console should warn us anytime an action is going to shutdown a running instance.  Had I known this, I would have done the create at a different time."
16603,Amazon EC2 V3,Suggestions on which Micro Instance to use for Facebook App Does anyone have a suggestion for a Micro Instance to use for a small Facebook App?    We're looking to move our Facebook App over to a Micro Instance. I'd like to use the 'LAMP Web Starter' Instance but that doesn't have the Micro Instance option.  Looking for suggestions for an available Micro Instance that has a web server fully configured and would by good for a Facebook App.

16600,Amazon EC2 V3,"What is the best strategy to run an AMI with cost efficiency? <span>Hi,We have launched an AMI instance, which hosts a web site for our client to use. The client will only need to access the site during the working hours every day between 6am and 6pm. The instance will have no use for the other time period. Currently, we are being charged for 24 hours a day. We like to find a way so that we can keep our instance running during the use time, and not being charged for the no-use time period. What will be the best strategy for us to accomplish that? Thank you,Jason Zou</span>"

16597,Amazon EC2 V3,"Cannot connect to SSHD on any of my AMIs Just 12 hours ago everything worked, not I cannot connect via ssh to any of my three instances:i-dbcdf8b1, i-3796a35d, i-71c4f11bRebooting does not fix the problem. FTP, HTTPD, MYSQLD work just fine as expected."

16595,Amazon EC2 V3,"Does Creating an Image from a Running Instance affect the Instance? Hello,My question is, will the process of creating an AMI from my running instance affect my running instance? i.e. will it hang, shutdown, be slow?I've read some threads around creating images from instances, and I read the tutorial here about creating an image from a running instance:http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/index.html?Tutorial_CreateImage.htmlMy concern is that I want to create an AMI from a production system (with a single ebs-volume as its root volume, no additional attached volumes)  so I can recreate that system in the event my current running instance crashed or took poorly to some patches or something. However, I don't want to try to create an AMI if it is going to affect the current instance. Thoughts? The tutorial doesn't specify if it will affect the running instance or not."

16577,Amazon EC2 V3,EC2 SharePoint 2010 servers not booting properly Has anyone out there had any issues with an EC2 instance that is running SharePoint 2010? We have two separate Amazon EC2 accounts and the SharePoint 2010 instances on each account no longer boot properly. We used to be able to remote into these servers without problems but about a month ago they all refuse to accept remote connections. This is the case with all ports open for RDP within the security group applied to the instances.One other thing I should mention is that if we log into any of our other EC2 instances we can ping the SharePoint 2010 instances but we still can't remote into them. This is why we're thinking they're getting hung on the boot process.
16577,Amazon EC2 V3,"I know you posted this a long time ago but did you ever get a resolution for this issue?

16576,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi jfong2001,I can't test a connection to port 3389 as you have filtered traffic to it with the Ec2 security group the instance is in. If updates you applied enabled, the Windows firewall may be enabled and filtering your connections. You might add a script to your start-up scripts, before applying the updates, that adds a rule to the Windows firewall allowing connections to port 3389 similar to:CMD> netsh firewall add portopening protocol=TCP port=3389 name=""RDP (TCP 3389)"" mode=ENABLE scope=SUBNET profile=DOMAINSee this article for more: http://www.windowsecurity.com/articles/Customizing-Windows-Firewall.htmlThanks, -Philip"

16576,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi,Sounds like you'll need to understand what update is breaking this for you or whether your script was successful. You should a) turn on your firewall and block port 3389 and restart (before installing anything else) to test your script. And b) stop the instance that you can't connect to and mount the boot EBS volume elsewhere and see if you can find the cause from the Windows system logs.Thanks, -Philip"

I checked the security groups that my instance is set to and I have the following set in the security group  icmp -1 -1 (196203565690,default) tcp 0 65535 (196203565690,default) udp 0 65535 (196203565690,default) tcp 22 22                0.0.0.0/0 tcp 80 80                0.0.0.0/0 tcp 3306 3306                0.0.0.0/0 tcp 8080 8080                0.0.0.0/0  My apache configuration I have the following set  In /etc/apache2/ports.conf  NameVirtualHost *:8080 Listen 8080  In my vhosts file I have the following  <VirtualHost *:8080> .... </VirtualHost>  The only thing I can think of is that its a firewall issue but with this port open I am not sure what else could be causing this to happen.

16557,Amazon EC2 V3,"Allen is right.  You can enable individual ports and protocols to specific CIDR ranges but if you enable a group, that group has full access to instances in the other group.  There is currently no way to restrict that access by port or protocol.From the EC2 developer guide:<blockquote>	The access rules define source based access either for named	security groups or for IP addresses (i.e., CIDR-based rules). For	CIDR-based rules, you can also specify the protocol and port range	(or ICMP type/code).</blockquote>Mitch"
16557,Amazon EC2 V3,Thanks Allen and Mitch for your responses and I appreciate your patience on this.  Given this functionality is working from the shell prompt (i.e. I have a number of current group and port specific firewall rules in place) do we believe that the scripts are not functioning correctly by allowing this capability ?
16557,Amazon EC2 V3,could you post the output of ec2-describe-group that shows a security group with one of these rules?
16557,Amazon EC2 V3,"I think you are mistaken.  The API simply does not support port-specific rules for groups.  Regardless of what you may think is currently working, you cannot restrict a group rule by specific ports.Mitch"
16557,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi there Mitch / Allen,   Thanks again for your help here. As requested please see the results of my ec2-describe-group which shows the security group Apache-InternallyControlled where 144XXXX is my user name.

GROUP	144XXXX	Apache-InternallyControlled	The Controlled Zone of the Apache Reverse Proxy group PERMISSION	144XXXX	Apache-InternallyControlled	ALLOWS	tcp	443	443	FROM	USER	144XXXX	GRPNAME	OpenVPN-Controlled PERMISSION	144XXXX	Apache-InternallyControlled	ALLOWS	tcp	5666	5666	FROM	USER	144XXXX	GRPNAME	Nagios-Management   These rules are definitely active as these systems are currently going through integration testing and passing test cases. Could the API have been updated recently to support this, or is it supported by some other functionality perhaps?"
16557,Amazon EC2 V3,"Well, either Amazon has changed this recently and neglected to announce it or update any of the documentation or there is a bug in the command line tools.Have you confirmed that these rules are actually in effect between instances in the two groups?  Can you, in fact, access instances in Apache-InternallyControlled on ports other than 443 and 5666 from instances in the other two groups?It would be great if this were actually working.  It's a feature I have asked for a number of times.  It just seems strange that it would appear suddenly without comment from AWS.Mitch"
16557,Amazon EC2 V3,I'm not sure which but I have definitely used this functionality and the firewall is in place so no you cannot access instances in Apache-InternallyControlled on ports other than 443 and 5666 with our current setup.

16557,Amazon EC2 V3,I'd still love to get an answer from AWS on this one.Mitch
16557,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi Mitch,The confusion here is caused by a subtle difference between the SOAP and Query API's for the AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress request. While the SOAP API does allow for specific port ranges to be specified when authorizing a user/group pair permission, the Query API does not.See the following paragraph on the AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress Query API reference (http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/2009-03-01/DeveloperGuide/index.html?ApiReference-Query-AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress.html):<blockquote>	When authorizing a user/group pair permission, GroupName, SourceSecurityGroupName and SourceSecurityGroupOwnerId must be specified. When authorizing a CIDR IP permission, GroupName, IpProtocol, FromPort, ToPort and CidrIp must be specified. Mixing these two types of parameters is not allowed.</blockquote>Since the command-line tools make use of the SOAP API, it is possible to specify  a port range when authorizing a user/group pair permission. Changing your application to use SOAP instead of Query, will also resolve your problem.We are currently working on resolving this inconsistency and will provide further feedback once it has been corrected.Regards,Dave"

16555,Amazon EC2 V3,"Instance stuck on Shutting Down, Volume incorrectly reporting Available Ok, I seem to have made a mess of trouble.We experienced a problem with one of the MS SQL Server instances on our account, and since I know from reading these forums that the best resolution is just to create a fresh instance, I decided to do that. I created an AMI from the existing instance, then started up a new instance based on that AMI... so far so good.I then detached the ElasticIP from the old instance, which worked, and attempted to detach the EBS volume from it as well. Despite correctly unmounting it from Windows, the EBS volume got stuck in ""detaching"" status, and would not become available.Reading the forums again, the resolution was to use the --force option from the CLI tools. This is the first time I've had to use the CLI tools, and ... WOW THEY SUCK. First of all, your tools seem incapable of coping when put in a directory with a space in the name (like, for example, ""Program Files"") and instead spaz-out with extremely value Java errors... welcome to 1988. There's nothing in your instructions indicating this, so huge strike there-- this wasted about an hour of my time. Setting up the environment to use the CLI tools was also a nightmare, certificates, throwing files all over, editing all kinds of strings in random locations, requiring Java... seriously, the experience here is *awful*. Especially when you have other people in the organization waiting to log back on to the server. PLEASE work on this.Sorry for the rant. Once I ran detach with the --force option, the volume appeared in the GUI as available, finally. So I try attaching the volume to the new instance only to find out-- somehow it's already attached! (I logged into the new instance via RDS to confirm.)So now I have one instance stuck in ""shutting down"": i-4bbc3621And one volume that thinks it's available: vol-eefeba87 (but is actually attached to instance: i-b53e01df)If an Amazon employee looks into this problem, please *do not* detach the volume, as we are actively working with it right now.

The request is failing and in log it's saying ""Connection refused to host: ip-192-168-122-1.ap-southeast-1.compute.internal"".I am confused as to where this hostname ip-192-168-122-1.ap-southeast-1.compute.internal is coming. Instead of this, it should take master;s host name. Is there something like mapping of IP addresses/hostnames in the cloud environment.Please help me in this regards."
16551,Amazon EC2 V3,Do your security groups allow connections between those two instances?
16550,Amazon EC2 V3,"How do you distinguish EC2 instances??? We are using our EC2 instances to a lot of test development so each developer brings up their own instance to work with.  These instances are interspersed with actual production and staging instances.  Is there any way to add a description or name or something to an instance?  I know there is that ""User Data"" field when you create the new instance, but I don't see where that is actually used.  Having to remember that your instance is ad67dfc2 as opposed to bfa391fc is really lame."
16550,Amazon EC2 V3,"A few points:a) Generally, I recommend that you do *NOT* intersperse prod/dev/test instances amongst each other.  What we do is that we have different AWS accounts (all billed to the same card using consolidated billing) for each -- so that the test account fires up only test instances, the prod account has only prod instances, etc etc.We learned this the hard way when we accidentally killed a prod instance when we wanted to kill a test instance b) Where do you want the annotation to be visible?  If you add it to the ""user data"" field  when you launch an instance it is visible IN the instance ONLY by accessing the http://169.254.169.254/ url from the instance in question.   If you want the data to be visible in your desktops, etc etc then I'd recommend doing one of the following:1) define a separate keypair one each for dev, test, stage.  Launch each type of instance with its own key pair.  The keypair then serves as the annotation that youa re looking for.2) if you want something more sophisticated then creating tags and storing it in a db when you launch the instance may be what you're looking for.We use approach 2) in our solution.- Bill"
16550,Amazon EC2 V3,"Bill's advice is good.  One other possible approach to distinguishing instances is by using do-nothing ""tag"" security groups:  http://www.shlomoswidler.com/2009/06/tagging-ec2-instances-using-security_30.html"
16550,Amazon EC2 V3,You could also use Rain Toolkit:http://www.logicstyle.com/raintoolkit.htmlIt solves this among other problems.

16548,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi cvertex,This question actually entails two answers:1) For EBS-backed instances, it's possible to migrate Linux AMI's to another region, but isn't a supported or built-in process from us (though, I know other customers have done this before). Windows AMI migration to another region is not a supported process.2) For instance-store backed instances, you can use the ec2-migrate-image command to perform the migration. Just ensure that the AKI and ARI (if an ARI is in use) that your current AMI uses are available in the target region (primarily a Linux step). You can see more about the ec2-migrate-image command here:http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/CommandLineReference/ApiReference-cmd-MigrateImage.htmlThat being said, a running instance can't be migrated to another region. You'd have to create an AMI from the instance before doing the migration. I hope this steers you in the right direction.Best Regards,Scott"

The details of installation I don't know, they will be on the service's web site.I can't see any alternative to getting around the firewall at least once, for example you might be able to create an EBS based image from home with the remote access service installed, and then use it from work.You might be able to get command line access to a Windows instance via ssh, in theory, but I doubt you can install these facilities except via a web browser running on the instance and, anyway, odds are if your firewall blocks remote desktop it will block ssh too."

16531,Amazon EC2 V3,"Configuring SSL with an ELB I have a web app that I deploy by creating several EC2 instances and putting them under an Elastic Load Balancer. Things run very well. I now have a requirement to also provide HTTPS access to this application, so that you can access it through either http://www.url.com OR https://www.url.com. I'm trying to understand what changes need to be made to my configuration, and think I've covered it all:I'll configure my EC2 AMI to have an SSL certificate so that it can be accessed securely. My certificate is self-signed, so there are no security or licensing issues to worry about. And yes, I understand SSL very well, and using a self-signed cert for this application is completely reasonable. I'll create a new Security Group which maps 80->80 and 443->443 and use this for each EC2 instance. Finally, when I create my ELB I'll create listeners for 80->80 and 443->443.Is that it? Am I missing something, or is this all I need to do to get this to work?"
16531,Amazon EC2 V3,You'll need two ELB listeners: one HTTP listener for port 80 and one TCP listener for port 443.  I don't understand your comment:  I'll create a new Security Group which maps 80->80 and 443->443 and use this for each EC2 instance.  What mapping are you talking about with security groups? Security groups for these instances will need to have ports 80 and 443 (or whatever backend ports you choose to use) open to 0.0.0.0/0.
16531,Amazon EC2 V3,"You're right, there is no mapping in security groups. Wrote that early in the morning and was looking at the security group configuration and saw 2 columns. I thought it was a mapping instead of a from/to for listing ports. Sorry for the confusion.I wanted to verify that I thought out all of the pieces - configure cert on AMI, open port in Security Group, and open listener in ELB. Sounds like that's all I need."
16531,Amazon EC2 V3,I asked about this before and go no answer - what if I want to use signed SSL certs? What domain do they get issued to?

16518,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hello, dogor97:There are a few ways:a) If you want the nature of the instance to be visible on the client, you could use the tag feature of ElasticFox (a plug in to Firefox).  You could store the tags associated with your instances when you launch instances with Elastic Fox.  The downside is that the tag is available only in that browser -- and not anywhere else.  So if others in your team want to see this,  you're out of luck.b) You could use the technique of creating dummy security groups -- named appropriately.  See http://www.shlomoswidler.com/2009/06/tagging-ec2-instances-using-security_30.html  (shlomo is an expert on aws/ec2 and you should bookmark him).  The advantage is that the ""tag"" is now available on the client and on the instance itself.c) You could roll your own solution -- storing things in a db, etc etc.- Bill"
16518,Amazon EC2 V3,"You can also use third-party tools such as ylastic, which allow you to tag instances and other resources. The disadvantage is that these tags are only visible within the specific third-party tool. Just like ElasticFox."
16518,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi Guys,Thanks for the ideas!  I've tried the three suggestions with success so now it's a matter of figuring out what will work better in the long run.Thanks!"
16518,Amazon EC2 V3,Just a clarification to my post above:  ylastic's tags are like ElasticFox in that they're not visible if you use any other client to manage your EC2 deployment.  But - unlike ElasticFox - ylastic's tags ARE visible in all ylastic connections no matter what browser or device client you're connecting from.

16517,Amazon EC2 V3,"This is one of the most oft-requested features, but it's not supported by EC2 yet.  You can use third-party dashboards (such as ylastic) to do this in a way that is visible from every client you might use to access that dashboard.  Or you can use the ElasticFox FireFox extension, but that only keeps the tags in the specific browser you're using - other browsers won't see your tags.  Or, you can use EC2 security groups to tag instances - here's my article about that:  http://www.shlomoswidler.com/2009/06/tagging-ec2-instances-using-security_30.html"

16509,Amazon EC2 V3,"New addition to APIs -- Launch metadata (+ what's the reason for <reason>?) One thing that I'm looking to do is specify an arbitrary piece of metadata with my runInstances call.  However, this is not metadata that is important to the running instance -- it's important to me outside of the cloud.  For instance, I have 2 applications (smurf, and bongo) -- each has a web tier.  Each of those web tiers uses the same AMI, but I use different security groups, access keys, and instance sizes.  I'd like a way to group a set of instances together by arbitrary metadata.  I'd like to tag a running instance with 'bongo' or 'smurf', without intruding on the metadata that gets passed to the instance.  This way, I can just query the list of instances by the metadata and know how large of a cluster I have allocated for each purpose.  Is there a good location to store this information?    I noticed that the DescribeInstances now returns a <reason/> tag within the instanceSet/items. What's the reason for <reason/>?   Could it be used for this purpose?  -- Jon"

The problem is that the full operation is not transactional, and I don't want to have instances lying around that I can't account for.  -- Jon"
16509,Amazon EC2 V3,"For a finite # of values, you could use the key name, i.e., create a key for each role, then launch the instance with the appropriate key.  The key name is returned with ec2-describe-instances.  Another option would be to create a different AMI for each role, since the AMI ID is also returned with ec2-describe-instances."
16509,Amazon EC2 V3,"That sounds like a good short-term solution, but it would be good to disassociate meaningful metadata (key, security group, instance size, etc.) from stuff that should be opaque to AWS.    I'd still push for them to adopt some concept that gives this ability."
16509,Amazon EC2 V3,"You can associate user metadata (see the -d and -f parameters to ec2-run-instances), but AFAIK, this metadata is not returned by ec2-describe-instances, it can only be read by the instance.  See ""Retrieving User Data"" at http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/2008-02-01/DeveloperGuide/AESDG-chapter-instancedata.html"

16507,Amazon EC2 V3,"How to share an EBS snapshot among multiple EC2 accounts? Hi,  In my organization, we use one EC2 keypair for day-to-day development and testing purposes, and a separate keypair for production. We do this to reduce the likelihood of someone accidentally taking down our production servers.  One step of our continuous integration story is a multi-hour database import and analysis job. Once the job is done, we snapshot the EBS volume that the data is stored to. Then, in day-to-day development tasks, we just create a new volume from that snapshot rather than redoing the full import.  So far, so good. However, I can't figure out how to share that snapshot (stored with the dev EC2 keypair) with the production environment (using the production keypair). For other S3 objects (such as our AMIs), we've been successful by granting the production keypair access to the appropriate objects. But since the EBS snapshots seem to be stored in non-user-visible S3 space, we can't do that for our snapshots.  Does anyone have any suggestions (other than manually snapshotting back to S3 on our own) for how to deal with this?  Or, does anyone have any tips about how we could use a single EC2 account for dev and production, but somehow set up a flag to keep the production instances safe from accidental deletion?  Thanks,  -Patrick"
16507,Amazon EC2 V3,"You are correct that there is no way to [currently] share EBS snapshots.  I haven't tested this, but you could try logging into your dev instance then running the command to create a snapshot using your production credentials.  I use this same method to copy AMIs from my dev account to my production account (so that deleting the AMI from dev doesn't break production).Colin"

Ideally, a way to also write a note about the running instance as well. This way when we have our own tech support dept going over the instances, they won't get confused. Our two instances are very similar in configuration based on the EC2 console, but very different as to what they are doing.We just had an accident where the wrong instance was terminated due to the confusion.It also wouldn't hurt if the info about the running instance showed the AMI's bundle source, and not just the AMI ID. We create our bundles using unique names that provide a clue as to what the AMI is. The AMI ID is useless on a human usability scale.Thanks!"

16502,Amazon EC2 V3,"Suggestion: Instance labels/names I searched a bit to see if I was double-posting but didn't find this - hopefully I'm not repeating somebody else. (Or maybe, hopefully I am!)It would be VERY nice if during the startup and run-time of an instance there was an option to name (and rename) it with a short label, ideally something that would show up in a column in ElasticFox. If you're starting up and shutting down a lot of instances, you suddenly have to be VERY careful not to click the wrong one. I literally sweat every time I shut one down, pinging all my live boxes to make sure I didn't click the wrong one! Remembering instance IDs and IP addresses just isn't reliable enough - if I could LABEL the instances like ""web3"" I would know exactly what I was up to.It's helpful for other tasks as well, like remapping elastic IPs from dead instances over to backup nodes."
16502,Amazon EC2 V3,"I agree, this would be a huge benefit.  We do some programmatic management of our EC2 instances, and the ability to attach an arbitrary piece of metadata (XML string or whatever) to an instance would make certain tasks much, much easier.Ideally we could pass some parameter to RunInstances, which would then be included in the return value of DescribeInstances later on.Currently we have to store this metadata in some kind of external data store, which introduces the risk of data getting out of sync with the actual list of EC2 instances."

16499,Amazon EC2 V3,Instance not shutting down after ebs volume detach I am unable to shutdown instance i-8d6157e7 after detaching the volume vol-44b52f2d.  This problem has occured consistently over the last few weeks when this volume is detached.
16499,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi,I see the shutdown and detach were eventually successful. You might try un-mounting the volume from within the instance before shutting down the instance. That will flush all writes to the volume and make sure the device is not busy.Thanks, -Philip"
16498,Amazon EC2 V3,"How about adding a tag/comment attribute to EC2 objects I find the ability of consoles like ElasticFox to tag EBS volumes AMIs, snapshots etc. with a user generated description to identify them very useful. But the limitation, of course, is that they are maintained inside the console, not on the objects themselves so don't appear on other people's listings, nor can they be used to, say, find the latest version of a certain snapshot programatically. How about adding a tag property to the objects themselves? If it would cause too much of a problem to change the specification of existing API methods to accommodate then it should be easy enough to define a few new methods.You could even go further and have a facility for an arbitrary set of named user properties."

16493,Amazon EC2 V3,"High %idle on EC2 instances despite high load. I like to fully-load our compute hardware to reduce wasted CPU time, and on typical in-house hardware this is fairly easy: load the machine with as many runnable threads as there are cores, and idle time will go to zero.  Here is an example app:  public class Looper {     public static void main(String[] args)     {         while (true) { new java.util.Random().nextBytes(new byte[4096]); }     } }  On our in-house, 8-core hardware, I can run 8 of these and idle time (as reported by mpstat and top) goes to zero. I can even add a 9th, 10th, etc process, and idle time stays very close to zero.  On EC2 (c1.xlarge instances), however, idle time is much higher than I'd expect. At 8 processes, idle time hovers around %1, and with 9, 10, etc processes, it can increase to 2%-3% or higher. With more complicated programs (not the example above), idle time can be even higher than that.  Can anyone explain this? This is with very recent Amazon kernels, and does not include stolen CPU time, which I would expect to see on EC2. Is this a problem with EC2 in particular, or is it general to Xen? Are there known workarounds?"
16493,Amazon EC2 V3,"I assume (and hope) what you mean is that you like to see 0% idle on your instances because they're doing useful work, and not that you run extra threads on your machines just to drive down idle time to 0%?  That particular load may be a problem, since Random() depends on entropy which is a bit more scarce on virtualized boxes. I find ""burnP6"" to be tried-and-true tool for generating CPU load."
16493,Amazon EC2 V3,"Yes, that's correct, doing useful work.  I'm not just trying to load the machine for the sake of load.  The implementation of Random() doesn't require any entropy from the system, so I don't think that explains it.  Regardless, I also see similar behavior with a simple Bash loop:     while (true); do i=$i+1; done  Though in that case it is less pronounced.  Message was edited by: Patrick Linehan"

16484,Amazon EC2 V3,"Newbie AMI related questions Hi chaps,I've a couple of questions relating to AMIs which I can't find addressed in the online documentation, and which I'd be grateful for any answers.1) When I create my own AMI and upload it with ec2-upload-bundle, will I be charged for its storage while it's in existence? This would imply that everyone who provides public images is doing it out of a sense of altruism, which I find slightly hard to believe.2) If I want to update a particular image, e.g. due to kernel and package patches, do I have to upload a whole new image (with a new identifier) each time, or can I just substitute the old for the new? I can see why such substitution would be frowned upon (mainly for reasons of version control).Thanks for any helpful answers."
16484,Amazon EC2 V3,"1) Yes, the storage costs are on the uploader.  However, AMIs are compressed before uploading, so you only pay for what you use.  Also, it is using S3 storage, so the costs are pretty small (even an AMI at the 10GB max size would only cost $1.50-$1.65 per month).  2) No, you cannot change an image and keep the same ami-id.  When you register a manifest, EC2 appears to log the checksum of the manifest.  Any changes and the AMI will not launch."

Hello,   We're a small team develop social applications with Microsoft .net Framework, and we're looking for a hosting service + NoSql Database in the cloud for our applications.   Our primary requirements are high performance & Scalability, and C#.net Support of course.   As a general question- what are the technological advantages of Amazon EC2 as a cloud hosting service, compared to Windows Azure?   Why sould I, as a .net developers, choose the amazon EC2 as a cloud service, instead of windows azure?   More questions:  1. What is included in the service?  2. How do I control my machines? Web Service? RDP? I didn't fully understand this issue.  3. .net support- do amazon support .net 4.0 and MVC 2?  4.

16471,Amazon EC2 V3,"Amazon AWS/EC2 is different to Azure. Amazon is ""infrastructure as a service"" and Azure is (currently at least) ""platform as a service"".With AWS you fully manage your virtual servers, it is up to you to install and maintain whatever you need on that including things like virus scanning, windows updates, asp.net security updates etc etc. In AWS you can set up a windows server for example and you do what you want with it.In Azure you don't have a virtual server as such, you just deploy your application to windows azure or make use of sql azure etc. You dont worry about windows updates etc but you don't have the same level of flexibility either.One thing I don't like about azure is that you can only have one asp.net application per web role which makes it costly. I prefer Amazon AWS myself although you should expect that bot amazon and microsoft will change what they offer so you need to keep up with the changes e.g. I believe Microsoft will be offering complete virtual servers in a few months."

16463,Amazon EC2 V3,You're not doing anything wrong.  Unfortunately you can't modify the configuration of an ELB after it is created. You need to create a new ELB with the desired configuration. This has the unfortunate consequence of requiring a change to your DNS CNAME entry to point to the new ELB's DNS name.

Simple house cleaning on servers should never cause catastrophic instance failures!!
16460,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi,I recommend that you review your console output (you can do this from Management Console, or from the EC2 API Tools with ec2-get-console-output).  It looks like your instance may have encountered an error installing Windows updates:""Windows failed to install the following update with error 0x80246007: Update for Windows Server 2003 (KB968389).""If a reboot does not resolve the issue for you, you will most likely need to launch a replacement instance.  As an aside,  I recommend that you consider using EBS volumes for persistent storage, which can reduce the impact of an instance failure and preserve your data, and also recommend that you create custom a custom AMI from your instance which will allow you to launch replacements easily.  The User Guide has some helpful information on this:<pre class=""console"">http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts-failure-resilient-apps.htmlRegards,-Jason</pre>"

16460,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi mydrew,Apologies for not wording my earlier response sufficiently clearly.  Your underlying infrastructure is healthy; your instance is failing to boot and become reachable over the network as a result of configuration problems inside the instance.  We cannot restore your instance to a running state on your behalf; you will almost certainly need to launch a replacement instance from your most recent AMI and restore your data from your most recent backups.  Running a Windows update shouldn't generally cause a problem under most circumstances, but it is always prudent to bundle before making significant changes.  In this particular case, you have noted that you had just finished making registry changes, which is most likely the cause of the instance failure.You are correct that the AMI bundling process documentation isn't very clear about the D: drive being excluded.  We will review the relevant user guide pages to make sure that information is clearly reflected.-Jason"

16445,Amazon EC2 V3,"If you use an EBS-backed image you can ""stop"" it rather than ""terminate"" it. While it's stopped the EBS volume and the data on it remains but you are not billed for instance time (though you are billed for the volume itself, which is pretty cheap). You can then start it at any time and your data and configuration will still be there.  See the documentation for more detail."

16429,Amazon EC2 V3,How to make EBS based AMI static? I've gone through the process of making my own AMI based on one of the Alestic ones. It boots and works well.But every time it boots it creates a new volume to run on. How do I make it so that it re-uses the snapshot one? I don't want multiple volumes all over the place. I just want one machine that remembers it's state and will boot when I want.There must be some attribute that tells it to instantiate a new volume each time.

16429,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi,Each instance launched from your EBS-backed AMI will create a new volume.  For one thing you would not want multiple instances all using the same EBS root volume; also attaching an EBS volume to more than one instance at a time is not supported.If you are only running one instance, you may want to consider stopping and starting that instance, instead of terminating it and launching replacements.  You might want to review this User Guide page:http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Tutorial_Launch_Stop_Start.htmlI still recommend that you keep an up-to-date AMI for launching a replacement if that becomes necessary, and/or snapshot your volumes to preserve restore points.Hope this helps!-Jason"

16428,Amazon EC2 V3,Typically you want to put your static content in S3 and then use Amazon Cloudfront to distribute it for you. Then your IIS server does not need to handle static content. You just have to update the URLs of your static contact to the S3 locations.  You still may need to do autoscaling of your applications as well.

16427,Amazon EC2 V3,"I am not aware of any way to set a fixed limit on how much you want to spend on EC2. You could post it as a feature request in this forum, though <img class=""emoticon"" src=""http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/images/emoticons/wink.gif"" border=""0"" alt="""" />"
16427,Amazon EC2 V3,"Correct, there is no way to cap usage now, but in requesting this feature, think about what you'd like to happen when the money runs out. Should the instance terminate? You may have lost data, but that's pretty much something you'd have to code around. Would you like warnings when things are ""close"" ? That way, you could do a controlled shutdown (or simply scale back your usage to allow critical things to continue running).David"
16427,Amazon EC2 V3,"I've always thought the more useful cap would be on S3 bandwidth. EC2 instance hours can't be started by anyone other than the person who's paying for it, so if you don't want to pay too much for EC2 time just don't start any more instances. Bandwidth controls in or out of EC2 is a ""might be nice"" feature, but mostly possible to manage inside of the EC2 instance, especially outgoing traffic. If you know you only want to send a gigabyte a day, your webserver can respond however it wants when it hits that limit. Getting a notification from Amazon when your instance is apporaching 1 gigabyte might be nice, since it's Amazon's definition of a gigabyte that counts for billing, not what your app thinks is a gigabyte.With public data in S3 there's nothing active that can be monitoring traffic. If you post a  video of your cat doing something cute, and a link gets posted to Slashdot and suddenly everyone wants to look at it you have no recourse other than hopefully noticing before it gets too out of hand. It's nice that S3 can handle the load, but maybe you don't want it too"

If the instance was stopped, it will then transition to a stopped state, all of its Amazon EBS volumes will remain attached, and it can then be started again at a later time.

A full instance hour will be charged for every transition from a stopped state to a running state, even if this happens multiple times within a single hour. If the instance type was changed while the instance was stopped, you will be charged at the new instance type&rsquo;s rate once the instance has been started.

16426,Amazon EC2 V3,"1. So, does it mean that the words ""Pay only for what you use..."" are not actual for S3 data storage technology? Thus, we need to refuse totally from S3 and use EBS?  ""Pay only for what you use"" is referring to the EC2 CPU and memory resources.  They mean that you don't pay the houly EC2 rate when your instance is terminated or stopped.  2. Why was assigned another IP address for our Instance?  Every time you stop and start your instance, it gets a new IP address.  If you want to keep the same address, then you will have to associate an Elastic IP address to your instance after each start.  3. I want to mention one more time: all the data was storing during one month after stop/start Instance meanwhile we were worked with the system. Is this a regularity or an accidental event?  They only way that your data would have persisted across stop-start is if it was on an EBS volume instead of an ephemeral volume.

If step #1 was successful try browsing from your local computer to the SAME IP address or DNS entry that you used to connect to terminal server.  If you cannot connect, then you probably have a firewall problem and you need to make sure you have HTTP configured in your EC2 instances Security Group.  3.

I moved some data onto the mounted volume. I then unmounted the volume from my instance and then detached the volume from my instance. From here, I then created a snapshot of the detached volume.After this I then create a volume from my snapshot and attached the created volume to my running instance.

16423,Amazon EC2 V3,"In between attaching the (newly created) volume to the instance and mounting it, you must have formatted it. If you hadn't formatted it you wouldn't have been able to put files on it.  Can you look back in your command history to see how you formatted it? It would be some kind of command involving ""mkfs"". That is the type of filesystem you created on the EBS volume, and that is what you'd need to specify for the mount command to succeed again.  If you didn't format it then you probably make a mistake and only _thought_ you were saving the data to the EBS volume, but it was actually not being used, and instead being written to the original instance's drives. You can verify this by checking the content of /mnt/myvol on the original instance - if it still contains the contents then that is what happened.  You can avoid this problem by changing the permissions of the mount point to ""400"". That will prevent you from writing to the mount directory when nothing is actually mounted there."
16423,Amazon EC2 V3,"Oh sorry about that. I forgot to mention the formatting part of the step.

16423,Amazon EC2 V3,"I think I figured out the problem.

16420,Amazon EC2 V3,"Good bye. Have a nice life.No, really. Use your brain. If you fear about too high fees, set up a checkscript in NAGIOS (or whatever monitoring solution you are using) that counts your momentary fees or accumulates monthly fees and raises an alarm once a threshold is reached."

16420,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi everyone in this thread.  It would be really great if you could set some budgets for your total instance account or if you could categorize instances from multiple or one account into a budget and set warnings on spending limit. So I agree with you all in this point.  I do believe this should never keep you from taking your own responsibility about monitoring your application and costs and taking action accordingly. So I also agree with you there David.  I've written up some of these problems and a solution we are working on the following blogpost: http://shapingclouds.com/2010/01/04/a-problem-and-a-solution-with-aws-no-segregation-of-instances-and-no-budgets/. I would love to this discuss this further with you maybe outside these forums in a less feature-request kind of way but more in a ""how can we improve this on our own"" kind of way.  There are also some screenshots in there of an app we're working on internally that is going to solve some of these problems for ourselves and they could solve them for you too."
16420,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi Michiel,such an application could be really interesting.However, you open more questions than you answer.You'd like to discuss your application with us. But what information do you provide? A few screenshots?? Is your application available for testing? With source code? As web application? Do users have to provide their aws credentials? What method  do you use for budget estimates - nagios monitoring, xml parsing of aws reports or modified instances? How reliable is your method?If you answer these questions, a discussion is possible. Here in the forum, so that everybody gets something out of it. Or are you planning to collect our knowledge and integrate it into your payed web application?regardsCarlos"
16420,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi Carlos,  I'm sorry for my unclarity. My blogpost has much of the answers you request and provides some screenshots but I'll clarify for myself here.  At this moment, we have a free demo application running on https://qloudwatch.com. At the moment, it provides cost information on your running instances. The demo app is only a week old so we haven't had time yet to implement reserved instances and all other costs metrics since we have a need for the information it currently provides in our own business and are very curious about what information other people find most important.  We've chosen to group instances into project so you can group instances from your AWS account into projects you share with other users or create budgets in te future. We've created the possibility to share projects with other users so you can even add EC2 instances from different accounts into one project so you can for example share costs or work with different internal company cards.  Users have to provide their AWS credentials so the application can automatically grab a list of instances you haven't added to any projects yet. The credentials also make sure the state of an instance is updated every 30 minutes so an instance gets terminated in Qloudwatch when you terminate it trough the API or AWS management console. You also get an e-mail for every instance you launched that isn't added to a project yet, so you never forget to add any instances to projects (even if they only run for 1 hour).  Currently we use the Amazon prices and just time calculation for cost estimates. We've not yet added importing the usage reports or implementing CloudWatch in the application but this is something I am looking at at this moment. Enabling EC2 CloudWatch is quite expensive in my opinion but it sure is the most accurate way of measuring instance statistics. So I will honestly say that our current method is definately not 100% accurate or fail proof. But it's a start that is helping us with budgeting and billing our project. I'm really open to suggestions if you would want to upload the usage reports, run some kind of agent on your instances or would like to use CloudWatch for getting more accurate stats.  We have no concrete plans on how to run this application commercially. We've discussed this somewhat internally (having a free account with 2 projects and for bigger accounts have a monthly fee or something) but this project started out from our own need and I'm really curious about if it would be useful to other people. We ARE planning to launch it as a payed app in the future if enough people provide feedback on what they want but we're really open about our intentions and like to improve budgets and costs for AWS users first, and then think about what we could get from it commercially.  I've provided more info in my post at my personal blog: http://shapingclouds.com/2010/01/04/a-problem-and-a-solution-with-aws-no-segregation-of-instances-and-no-budgets/  Carlos, I hope I've provided enough information for a discussion here now and love to know your feedback.  Oh, by the way. The AWS credentials are of course encrypted in our database so they can't be read if the database somehow would get corrupted or ""stolen"". Also, the demo is secured with a verified class 1 SSL certificate.   Message was edited by: Michiel Sikkes"
16420,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi Michiel,thank you for the detailed explanations. I still don't get how you ""use the Amazon prices and just time calculation for cost estimates"". The most interesting part when it comes to billing is the network traffic which can sum up to 120$ per instance hour. If I understand you correctly, you simply take the hourly CPU instance price and neglect this negligible 120$. Is this correct? Then I suggest to change this first.Oh, by the way. I may trust your company to try your best to encrypt the supplied credentials. But everybody can make mistakes. If you want people to test qloudwatch, my second suggestion is to make it open source.regardsCarlos"
16420,Amazon EC2 V3,"I think this is an important feature. The best place to implement such a cost-monitor is at Amazon side, in their billing system -  for example a simple cost-beyond-threshold alarm (sms).Google app engine has free quota and also allow user to set limit of the billable usage."
16420,Amazon EC2 V3,"Hi Carlos,  Thanks for your response and feedback.  About the network traffic. You are correct, currently we have no functionality to calculate this for our instances in Qloudwatch. There are several options I'm thinking of: an agent client that communicaties with the web application, getting it from the API if Amazon CloudWatch is enabled for the instance (but this is expensive) or using an open source monitoring app that communicates to our servers or where Qloudwatch can get it's data from.  The first option - with a client agent - is more desirable for costs. The second with CloudWatch is however more accurate because you use Amazon's statistics about the instance.  What is your thought in the latter alternatives?  I'm aware storing your AWS credentials is a bit scary. You are right: everyone can make mistakes. Open source could be the right way to get some trust from the community. However, if you're still hosting the service yourself. You can make the same mistakes as we do. If you trust the company, they could let themselves be audited by security firms to get that extra trust. Thanks for the suggestion."
16420,Amazon EC2 V3,"If there is a solution possible with a monitoring daemon running in each instance, I think this one is preferable over cloudwatch. Cloudwatch will always be limited to what Amazon is asked for by 99% of their customers. They probably don't care about the last 1%.Something like your qloudwatch as open source could be extended to everyone's need. For example, I need to divide costs not only per instance (or instance groups which you named projects) but also per process and seperated by internal/external bandwidth costs. I have experimented with virtual network adapters but couldn't come up with a satisfying result.Judging from the screenshots you built a nice web interface around something that could be hacked into a cron job in less than an hour. Now starts the interesting part. Are you willing to invest your time into something _really_ helpful? Maybe we should wait a few days for other opinions. If there are none, I'd be interested in sharing experiences with you via private messages/email.regardsCarlos"
16420,Amazon EC2 V3,"Yes, that was also my opinion. Running some kind of daemon just like scoutapp.com does that connects to the main web app server to get it's stats is a great way to probably make a right estimate for bandwidth usage and for example storage usage.  That's also a great suggestion. Well when we have everything up and running for ourselves we could look at open sourcing some bits or everything. For example use the Wordpress model. Open source the ""general"" app and host some of the premium features. We're going to look it.  The web interface is something that is most important for us. I mean, yes you can calculate everything from the Amazon bill, trough the API and put it all in one large spreadsheet but the point is having fun and a one-look insight in your usage. The actual technique of monitoring is not very difficult and there are a few options. The web interface and the ease of configuration should make it stand out from a traditional shell script.  Thanks for your feedback so far. You can always send me a private message or e-mail to discuss things in more detail but I'm happy to wait for some days for more opinions too.  Cheers Michiel"
16420,Amazon EC2 V3,"Jerry,  Having Amazon implemented would of course be best and most accurate. They've done terrific job on the AWS Console so far. If they could have such kind of dashboard for financials as well that would be great for a management standpoint in cloud applications."
16420,Amazon EC2 V3,"I don't ask for tool to watch or control my machines but for a LIMIT to prevent my ruine - this is only possible IN the Amazon-Accout! -There would be three limits: (1) A maximum S3 usage limit; any attempt to create files that go over the limit would fail.  (2) A maximum S3 transfer limit in dollars; when the limit is exceeded, no more for-pay transfers are possible.  (3) A maximum EC2 monthly usage limit in dollars; EC2 instances would be terminated if they go over the limit, either in terms of CPU or bandwidth.In the admin interface, users could temporarily or permanently raise the limit.  When limits are in danger of being reached (Warning level), an E-mail address could be notified. <img class=""emoticon"" src=""http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/images/emoticons/wink.gif"" border=""0"" alt="""" />"

16414,Amazon EC2 V3,"Count me in,  when you get a 10.2 call me!!!emg@EdwardMGoldberg.com"
16414,Amazon EC2 V3,"I finally got a bare-bones openSUSE 10.2 system built and running.It's been a very difficult multi-stage bootstrap exercise but I now have the max 10GB root filesystem, can use yast to install more software on it, and use ec2-bundle-vol to save back the image to S3 for the next round of bootstrapping.It's still too early for this AMI to mark it as shareable but I can share with you some rough notes and   'gotchas', not all covered in forums to date as far as I can tell.- I would have liked to completely script the build along the lines of the excellent debian and redhat build scripts already made public, but this involved AutoYast and every time I started with it I ended up waking up in a gutter somewhere.  Alternative was to use Yast's ""Install into Directory"" feature, after creating a 1GB loopback file sys.  Needed to keep the image absolutely minimal.. uploading images from long distance was a serious constraint.. But no matter how many things you de-select in yast, the installer insists on installing a ton of stuff you don't need just so as to ensure there won't be room for the stuff you do need.  I just tried to keep it under the 1GB, but as you'll see below, this caused a lot of pain.. go for about 3GB and just don't plan to ec2-upload it from Sydney.- Do pretty well all the non-distro-specific things that are in Paul Morris' ""self-bundling AMI"" post for Debian.  - In addition:  note that EC2 will bring up the sys in runlevel 4.  The reason nobody has been getting a login prompt is because suse's /etc/inittab has runlevel 4 commented out!  Just remove that comment.  While there, comment out ttys 2-6 as noted in other posts.- Use chkconfig to add sshd and network services to runlevel 4.    - See my recent post in this forum (titled ec2-bundle-vol error 141) for code showing fix to ""MAKEDEV"" lines in ruby script as applied to suse and recommended by others.- ec2-bundle-image will now produce something that can be uploaded and will start.  The problem is that the 1GB root file system is so full that you can do very little with it.  You can't even start configuring yast.. point it to a suse repos and it will load tons of metadata into /var/adm.  This is enough to fill and break the root file sys.- In one unrepeatable session on the new instance, I removed a lot of fluff that I used to consider valuable, such as /usr/share/doc, locales etc.   I also temporarily moved /usr/share and some other big areas to /mnt and set up symbolic links pointing to them.  This was all so that I could free up enough space to start configuring yast so I could install ruby so I could use the AMI bundling tools to re-write what I had so far into a 10BG image (after restoring the moved folders).  Don't forget to once again do the ""MAKEDEV"" edits mentioned above.  If any of you manage a clean, scripted build, presumably auto-yast driven, that will be superior if only because it will be repeatable, but if none of us can produce that then I will try to tidy up my image and make it public.  But for now the good news is, it can be done!"

It was not until I actually added the IP for port 11211 to the 'memcache' group that the memcache server was visible to the web server.  I've read the docs at the link,   http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/DeveloperGuide/index.html?using-network-security.html, but that did not give me any insight as to why I cannot connect to the memcache server.  Has anyone had success setting up memcache in a separate security group?  If so, what steps did you take?  And, did you have to add the IP for every VM?  Do the instances have to be in the same zone?  Thanks."
16407,Amazon EC2 V3,"I figured out that I need to use the DNS name for my elastic IP rather than the IP itself.  This, then, resolves to the internal IP which the security groups recognize.  See this article...  http://alestic.com/2009/06/ec2-elastic-ip-internal  I hope this helps others out there with similar setups."
16406,Amazon EC2 V3,"Billing Question Hello,just a billing question about reserved instances. What happen after the 3 years when you selected the 3 year term to get a cheaper runtime fee?a) the instance is deleted (hopefully not) b) you have to pay another 3 year term feec) no further term fee with the running instance but the cheaper runtime feeThanks for help.Greetings,Andreas"
16406,Amazon EC2 V3,"After the your reserved instance term runs out, your instance would continue running and would be billed at the regular (non-reserved) hourly rate."
