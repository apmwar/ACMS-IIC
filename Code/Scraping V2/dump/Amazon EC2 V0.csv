I started with a basic starcluster image (ubuntu 13 I believe), updated it, installed GSL and created an AMI from it - ami1. I then went ahead and removed OpenMPI, installed the anaconda-python stack for scipy, edited the /etc/envirioment file so that all users have this on their path, updated alternatives, etc. Verified everything was working great. I created a new ami from this-ami2. Now whenever I start a new cluster from ami-2, regardless of size, I can never log into them. All startup checks pass, but when I try and ssh into them using starcluster sshmaster mycluster, it immediately replies with connection closed. I have started from ami-1 and recreated another ami-3 again, following the same basic steps just to make sure I didnt make a mistake. However, same problem. Running starcluster listclusters --show-ssh-status myCluster shows that SSH is DOWN. So somehow, installing a suite of python scripts, and updating alternatives and removing openmpi somehow prevents SSH from starting and Im locked out?   Any help would be great!"

59824,Amazon EC2 V0,"ELB: 3 minutes delay in detecting instance health We have been observing 3-4 minutes delay until when an elb starts to observe instance health correctly. Combined with Auto Scaling, this seems to cause a number of additional timeout errors at end users' side, when an auto scaling group triggers instance initiations (when a service is typically under heavy load).  For example, here are what I reproduced to explain what's happening.   I have an elb named heavy-app:  AWS> elb-describe-lbs --show-long --headers LOAD-BALANCER,NAME,DNS-NAME,HEALTH_CHECK,AVAILABILITY-ZONES,INSTANCE-ID,LISTENERS,CREATED_TIME LOAD-BALANCER,heavy-app,heavy-app-123456789.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com,""{interval=15,target=HTTP:8080/?max=100,timeout=10,healthy-threshold=3,unhealthy-threshold=8}"",us-east-1c,(nil),""{protocol=HTTP,lb-port=80,instance-port=8080}"",2009-08-01T05:29:06Z  and an auto scaling group associated with the heavy-app elb:  AWS> as-describe-auto-scaling-groups --headers AUTO-SCALING-GROUP  GROUP-NAME    LAUNCH-CONFIG     AVAILABILITY-ZONES  LOAD-BALANCERS  MIN-SIZE  MAX-SIZE  DESIRED-CAPACITY AUTO-SCALING-GROUP  heavy-app-c2  heavy-app-config  us-east-1c          heavy-app       0         0         0                 At this stage, there were no instances associated with the elb as min-size is set to be 0.  Now, I let the auto scaling group to initiate two new instances by chaning min-size and max-size at 2009-08-03T16:50:00+0000.  AWS> as-update-auto-scaling-group heavy-app-c2 --max-size 2 --min-size 2 OK-Updated AutoScalingGroup  About 30 seconds later (2009-08-03T16:50:29+0000), 2 new instances were actually initiated according to ec2-describe-instances. An instance usually takes 4-5 minutes to get ready to serve after its initiation in this experiment.  As soon as I got the instances' public host names, I started to check the followings periodically - say every 15 seconds from 2009-08-03T16:51:46+0000:  (1) whether elb-describe-instance-health reports the two instances are healthy or not (2) whether two instances respond to a http get request at its http port 8080 (3) whether the elb responds to a http get request at port 80  As I said before, the two instances are not available during the first 4-5 minutes. Therefore, elb-describe-instance-health should report they are OutOfService during this period. However, what I found is:  (a) Up until 2009-08-03T16:53:07+0000, the two instances were reported as ""InService"" although no instance was available at their port 8080. (b) At 2009-08-03T16:53:07+0000, elb-describe-instance-health started to report as ""OutOfService"" (c) One instance finally got ready at 16:55:25, and the other at 16:55:26 at port 8080 (d) At 2009-08-03T16:55:30, elb-describe-instance-health started to report as ""InService"" and I can access the app at the elb port 80.  In this experiment, there was a FALSE NEGATIVE period for 3 minutes. Here are what CloudWatch tells me.

To me, there are two potential causes. One is the instance health status at elb, by default, was set to be ""InService."" The other is, an elb does not perform instance health check ups for a few minutes after it was notified a new instance was added to the elb. If these are true, a fix of any of the two would resolve the problem.  In the above, I have described the symptoms when the very first instances were added to an elb for the sake of simplicity. But in practice, things could be even worse. The same thing happens when an auto scaling group scales up. Here is an example. There are two existing and running instances registered at an elb. And two new instances are added to the elb due to heavy load. None of the two added instances are not ready to serve for the first 5 minutes, but the elb thinks they are available. Then we observe an increase in the number of timeouts at the user's end for a few minutes. I suspect the elb distributes requests to all the four instances including the two new instances which are not yet ready, which might result in the increased timeouts. Increased timeouts due to auto scaling activities would defeat the purpose of auto scaling.  Or, did I miss something in using elb+as correctly?"
59824,Amazon EC2 V0,"Congratulations on your very thorough and effective use of the AWS toolset to diagnose the issue.The situation you describe (newly registered instances showing as InService, even though they may not yet be running), is a known issue listed in the ELB release notes at:  http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=2533&categoryID=86Which states:    ""Regardless of the actual health of an instance, the LoadBalancer will assume a newly registered instance is healthy and put it into the InService state. If the instance is unhealthy, it will be transitioned to the OutOfService state on the first health check.""You are right that in general, this creates a window where it is possible for ELB to send traffic to an instance that is not yet ready to process the traffic.  There are, however, a few other behaviors of ELB that reduce this risk:  - ELB will not attempt to send any traffic to instances that are not yet in the RUNNING state, even if elb-describe-instance-health reports InService.  - ELB will not send traffic to an instance if it cannot even open a TCP connection to that instance's application port, even if elb-describe-instance-health reports InService.So there are at least two possible ways to avoid sending traffic to an instance that is not yet ready to handle that traffic, until the underlying ELB problem is fixed:1) Make sure that your application does not begin accepting connections until it can properly handle traffic over those connections.2) If, for some reason, your application must start accepting connections before it is able to process requests correctly, then one can tune the ELB health check parameters 'UnhealthyThreshold' and/or 'Interval' to be more agressive: you would want to tune them so that in the interval between the instance transitioning to 'running' and the application starting to accept connections, enough health ELB health checks have failed so that the instance has been marked OutOfService.Please accept our apologies for this problem.  We realize that this impacts the availability of our customers' applications, which we take very seriously.Best Regards,Chris"
59824,Amazon EC2 V0,"Thank you Chris, for the known issue page and further tips.  Our instances do not open port 8080 until everything is ready on the instance. Thus, based on the two specs you described, I should say our elb should not have sent requests to the newly added instances until they are ready. In other words, the time window issue I reported here does not explain the increased timeouts during scaling up activities. Since we have no means to look inside the elb, it is difficult to identify these timeout causes on our side. Perhaps, the root cause of this timeout issue might be that a virtual load balancer in an elb does not outperform other software based load balancers (e.g. nginx/haproxy) as some people reported here in this forum.  Thanks again for your reply. And if AWS could post a note whenever elb is improved during the beta period, we would really appreciate it."
59824,Amazon EC2 V0,"The reason for the increased timeouts is that when a new instance is added, our current default behavior is to mark the instance as InService and start healthchecks. Beacuse your UnhealthyThreshold is set to 8 with 15 second intervals and 10 second timeout, the minimum amount of time before the load balancer would report OutOfService would be 2 minutes and 10 seconds.We appreciate your investigation and raising this concern with us. We are working to correct this issue to prevent such timeouts from occurring. In the meantime, you can significantly reduce the period of timeouts by reducing the UnhealthyThreshold and/or interval of your load balancers.Thanks,Erik"
59824,Amazon EC2 V0,"Erik, many thanks you for pointing me out what could be done on my side!"
59824,Amazon EC2 V0,Has this bug been squashed yet?ie. When an instance is added to an ELB default state should be OutOfService until the instance passes the health check?I ask as we had an instance accepting traffic for 10+ mins even though apache was clearly returning a 500 error.The solutions above do not apply as we need to test application functionality by hitting apache.
59824,Amazon EC2 V0,The solution suggested above is to increase the frequency and decrease the threshhold of the health checks. This will have the effect of causing ELB to discover sooner that the instance is not really InService.Why won't this work for you?
59824,Amazon EC2 V0,"Upon provisioning, the system boots up with apache started.There is no code on the system.It take 2-3 mins to fully provision our server(Retrieve codebase run puppet etc).The final step is a wget to the localhost to a specific test URL.Our healthcheck URL requires a file to exist on the local file system.The healthcheck will fail until that file is created.  That file is created only after the wget retrieves specific content.  We need apache running, but during the entire provisioning process our healthcheck is in a failed state.Current I'm running at 10 second intervals and 2 fails to go unhealthy.so 20 seconds. max I imagine. Be nice if it just was disabled right off the bat.  F5s Foundries and Nortel hardware LBs all wait for a successful healthcheck before enabling."
59824,Amazon EC2 V0,"We are working on this fix. We appreciate your patience, and for bringing it to our attention."
59824,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi, I have the same issue and this is seemingly still not working. What is the estimated ETA on this? Preferably in way that registers new server as ""OutOfService"" per default until the health check has been performed.Thanks,Elfar"
59824,Amazon EC2 V0,"I'm running into the same issue. 4.5 years later. The ELB health checks a new instance while it's being provisioned, and with my current parameters, 2 health checks 30 seconds apart, the ELB permanently marks the new instance as ""Out of Service"" before it's even fully provisioned. While increasing the ""failed health check"" threshold and interval between checks would work, it's an ugly solution, and makes the health monitoring less responsive than I'd like.

59823,Amazon EC2 V0,"EC2 Instance timing out on connections from some sources, but not all Hi there,  Having a peculiar problem with one of my EC2 instances (i-9f8329a3).  For some reason it seems to be dropping/timing out on connections from some sources but not all - in particular it seems to be occuring when two connections are opened simultaneously from a single source.  I'll provide an example to help clarify:  On any machine here at work, all on the same external IP and the same ISP (Telstra) we can repeatedly see the following behaviour:  1. Log into RDP session with the instance 2. Browse around a bit - it all operates nicely 3. Attempt to copy a file into the instance 4. RDP connection immediately times out  Repeating these same steps from my home computer on a different IP address (and a different provider - Internode) results in no such issue, the file is able to be copied over just fine.  We've also been receiving complaints from our customers that they're unable to download a file from our web site - the file is being delivered via an ASP.NET CMS and I think this connection problem is probably related as they're seeing the same thing we see (the connection to file is just timing out, they're unable to get over 0% downloaded).  This all started just the other day after our instance had a couple of failed status checks.  It went down once but restarted fine, then it went down again and couldn't be restarted.  We realised that we had received an email saying that it was being retired so I'm assuming perhaps the underlying hardware was experiencing some problems?  At any rate, we stopped and started the instance in order to migrate it and it's ever since then that things haven't been quite right.  I'm sorry if this seems a bit rambling or unclear but I'm a bit at a loss here as to what I should even try.  I'm not an incredible expert when it comes to sysadmin stuff so I'm hoping someone can provide some clear advice on what might be going wrong.  I've considered whether it might be worth stopping and starting the instance again, as I understand this will start it again on different hardware, is that correct?  Could that fix the problem?"
59823,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi Nick_Coad,  I have investigated the underlying infrastructure your instance is currently running on and can confirm we have identified a problem. You should soon receive an advisory requesting you stop and start your instance to re-locate it to another host in the Availability Zone.   Thank you for reporting this. Please let me know if you continue to experience the issue after a stop/start.   Regards,  Alastair"
59823,Amazon EC2 V0,"Thanks very much for the reply.  I'm not in a position to restart it straight away as it's a live server, but at close of business I'll restart it and return with the results."

59823,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi Nick,  Thanks for the update. I can see the host has changed for the instance.   We're investigating and we'll get back to you as soon as we can via this thread.   Regards,  Alastair"
59823,Amazon EC2 V0,Just wondering if there's any further word on this?  Basically people can download a few hundred kilobytes of a file and then it stops sending and eventually times out.
59823,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi Nick,  We're still looking into this, but one thing that a colleague has suggested is to confirm you're running the latest PV drivers within your instance? We have instructions for updating these here:  http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/Upgrading_PV_drivers.html  As the issue seems to have followed a relocation within our infrastructure, it would be good to ensure you're running the latest drivers to rule out any issues at that layer.   Regards,  Alastair"

59823,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi Nick_Coad,  I've just take a look at this and I can see that the instance does not  have an EIP attached - was it moved to your backup instance? I can't quite pick out which instance is the old backup / current live one in your VPC at the moment.  Just some queries on this:  How exactly are files being copied / downloaded from the server? Is it a direct connection from the client to that instance? Would it be possible to run some MTR tests to see what paths are being taken, in both a successful connection and a failing connection? Are you seeing any errors in your instance Event logs in relation to this?   Cheers Iain"
59823,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi Iain,  Yep we switched the EIP to the backup server.  Original live server (now backup server) = i-9f8329a3 Original backup server (now live server) = i-1c62e323  The files are being downloaded a few different ways, the approach doesn't seem to make a difference.  Some files are downloaded via an ASP.NET application called Sitefinity which serves the files from a SQL Server database, some other files are downloaded via a URL pointing straight at the file in the file system.  Neither approach is working at the moment.  I can't see anything in the event logs that would indicate a problem unfortunately, there's no errors there at all.

59822,Amazon EC2 V0,"EC2 Free Tier - CPU Usage So my question relates to CPU usage. You get 750 hours of EC2 running Microsoft Windows Server Micro instance usage. How is this calculated, is there any way you can go over this in a month? There's only 730 hours in a month so I'm curious as to why they added 20 more hours."
59822,Amazon EC2 V0,"It's calculated by tracking every hour your EC2 instance is online (powered on). If you were to bring up a second instance you would not have enough hours for both to be running the entire month.  Also for months that have 31 days you'd need 744 hours so that's why it 750.

59821,Amazon EC2 V0,"Unable to remote desktop I have a Windows instance, id i-789ecd00, that was stopped for about 6 months but I have now restarted. Previously I was able to access it by RDP but now I cannot.  I have checked the active security group has port 3389 open to my ip address and I have checked the password I have on file using the EC2 console Get Password facility.  Attempting to access by Remote Desktop I get the password challenge, so I think that confirms the port is open properly, but the credentials fail. I am wondering if the password has expired. Is there a way to reset it?"
59821,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  Thank you for using the AWS forums. If you are able to reach the instance and it gives you the challenge for the password, your are successfully hitting it with RDP. You could also test this trying to open a telnet session over the port 3389,  telnet <IP ADDRESS> 3389.  If you are still unable to connect it sounds like a password issue.   Some times I have seen when people will use a copy/paste for the password it will give a trailing white space. To eliminate this issues I would recommend typing the password in manually.   If you are still unable to access the instance with the administrator account, and you have not created another use to have access. You may need to detach the volume and either move your data, or try and modify the EC2 config service to generate a new password and relaunch as a new instance from this AMI. Please let me know if you would need more guidance on how to accomplish this.   I hope this helps,  -AdamC"
59821,Amazon EC2 V0,"Thanks Adam.  As a test I have created another instance under the same SG and I can log in to that without problem. I think we can be fairly sure it's a password issue on the old instance. There won't be much data on the machine but, before I was diverted to other jobs, I had done quite a lot of config work on it. My bad that I didn't check the password expiry but, unless it's many hours of work, it would be worth trying to regain access rather than starting afresh.  Help on resetting password would be gratefully received!  Mark"

59820,Amazon EC2 V0,"EC2 - Multiple keys able to access instance I have a VPC and launched an instance with a private IP, but no public IP. Upon launching an instance, I specified an existing key pair, and using my Linux bastion host, can connect with it via  ssh -i myKeypair.pem ubuntu@private.ip.address.here  without any problems.  Now I have 4 key pairs existing, and one time I connected to my instance accidentally using another key pair, such as  ssh -i myOtherKeypair.pem ubuntu@private.ip.address.here  Well, I was able to login without any problems too, and no error about invalid key pairs was displayed.  I'm not sure if this is even possible, but I'm assuming it shouldn't be, for security purposes.  Is this an EC2 feature? Or a bug?  Thanks in advance."

Can you please post your instance-id here and also tell us a little bit about how you launch the instance.  While logged in to the instance please also check ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file to see how many keys are in there (each key starts with ssh-rsa).  Kind regards,  Mostafa S."
59820,Amazon EC2 V0,"Many thanks, Mostafa.  It seems to be the case. I've created this AMI from an instance I previously configured (to be used as a template for my servers) with keypassA, and on launching new AMIs from this one, I assign them keypassB.  I also have both entries in the authorized_keys file under the .ssh folder.  Guess I have to remove the original keypass when I create new AMIs out of this template.  Is there anything that can be set in the console while launching an instance so that this does not happen? Or should I remove the original keypass in the .ssh/authorized_keys ""prior"" to creating an image?  Thanks!"
59820,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  Unfortunately there is no setting from AWS console which would remove the old keys and just add the new key during launch. However as you said the best practice is to remove the old keys before creating AMI.  Thanks, Vivek"

59815,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  Did the instance not get a public IP after a stop and start, or has this instance never had a public IP associated with it since it was launched?  Regards,  Matt R."
59815,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi Matt,  We've had an IP address on this server previously, it was associated with an EIP which we have since disassociated and re-associated to a different instance.  I'll see if I can explain a bit better:  Server A : i-9f8329a3 Server B : i-1c62e323  The problematic instance (Server A) was originally set up as our primary web server, with an elastic IP assigned.  We also had a backup server (Server B) which was just using whichever public IP address it happened to be assigned by Amazon, as it wasn't critical that the IP address be statically assigned.  This worked fine for a while and then Server A began experiencing some connection issues (see unresolved question here: https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=146339) and we were eventually forced to retire that as our primary server and switch to Server B.  To do this, we removed the EIP from Server A and attached it to Server B instead, giving Server B the same external/public IP address as Server A previously used.  This worked fine for Server B and our web site is currently running nicely on that IP address.  But it left Server A without a public IP address, and we're unsure how to set it up with one."

I get the following output on the command line:  ssh -v -i dvhost.pem ubuntu@ec2-54-235-124-85.compute-1.amazonaws.com OpenSSH_6.2p2, OSSLShim 0.9.8r 8 Dec 2011 debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh_config debug1: /etc/ssh_config line 20: Applying options for * debug1: Connecting to ec2-54-235-124-85.compute-1.amazonaws.com http://54.235.124.85 port 22. debug1: connect to address 54.235.124.85 port 22: Connection refused ssh: connect to host ec2-54-235-124-85.compute-1.amazonaws.com port 22: Connection refused  Thanks for your help!"
59807,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi,  Unable to connect via port 22 via nc and telnet.   ~]$ nc -vz 54.235.124.85 22 nc: connect to 54.235.124.85 port 22 (tcp) failed: Connection refused  ~]$ telnet 54.235.124.85 22 Trying 54.235.124.85... telnet: connect to address 54.235.124.85: Connection refused  -Looks like an Ubuntu IPTables/Firewall issue.    Well, thanks to EBS there is a solution.      1. Stop your instance     2. Attach your EBS volume to another instance. if you don't have one, create a micro instance.     3. Mount yor EBS volume somewhere ie. /opt/recover     4. Edit {your-ebs-mount}/etc/ufw/ufw.conf and change enabled=yes to enabled=no     5. Umount the EBS     6. Detach from the temp instance     7. Reattach to the original instance     8. Restart the instance  Now your firewall is disabled in your instance, so you can access it via ssh.  Check the tables with:  sudo iptables -L   Allow Incoming Traffic on Specific Ports (22)   To allow incoming traffic on the default SSH port (22), you could tell iptables to allow all TCP traffic on that port to come in.  sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport ssh -j ACCEPT  To disable the Firewall:  sudo ufw disable  To save the configuration, you can use iptables-save and iptables-restore.   I hope this helps.   Ashley."
59807,Amazon EC2 V0,"OK, so I did as you recommended but it turned out that the ENABLED flag was already set to NO. The issue is still persistent.

59806,Amazon EC2 V0,"Normal practice for using instance store Hi,  I have been building an m3.large Windows instance that comes with a 30GB instance store that got given Z: Drive label.   The C: Drive on the machine was too small for installing some of the apps we use so I started installing stuff on the Z: Drive but I'm wondering if this was the best approach or whether I would have been better to snapshot the C: drive and create a new larger drive using the snapshot. But then would that new drive be on the instance or would it be some external drive that would be slower for things like temp log files, etc.  Any advice would be appreciated.  Cheers, Rob."
59806,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi Rob,  Please be aware that the data in an instance store persists only during the lifetime of its associated instance. Therefore, do not rely on instance store volumes for valuable, long-term data. Instead, keep your data safe by using a replication strategy across multiple instances, storing data in Amazon S3, or using Amazon EBS volumes. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html#instance-storage-concepts  For more information on EBS Volumes please see: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AmazonEBS.html  To increase the EBS Volume which is attched to your instance as C Drive you would need to create an AMI from the instance and launch a new instance from this AMI and increase the Size of the Volume during this launch process. After you launched the new instance you can increase the Disk size within the OS via the Windows Disk Management. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/Creating_EBSbacked_WinAMI.html#how-to-create-ebs-ami http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-expand-volume.html#recognize-expanded-volume-windows  Regards, Peter V."

59803,Amazon EC2 V0,"c1.medium instance in N Virginia gets non-responsive every few days hi there!  I manage a c1.medium instance on EC2 with a 200gb EBS volume attached. We run a basic web server (LAMP - ubuntu) on this server. Since 2014, this instance goes non-responsive with no access to the apache, ssh or any other service. I have installed a few cloudwatch alarms which update me when the server hangs by their insufficient data status. The management console keeps saying that the instance status is running with all status checked cleared even though it is non-responsive.  I checked the apache mysql, ssh, ftp, php logs and none indicate any high level activity at the time of the hang. At which point, I have to manually reboot the server.  But I do need to get to the bottom of this issue as its affecting our business activities severely. Could be a hardware or network issue or a server config issue? This server has been running nominally for the past 3 years but the problem started since Jan 2014. In december I did manually shut and start the server in response to an email from amazon stating that this instance was scheduled for retirement on 12/6/13 and I had to fix it by stopping and restarting it. I dont know if that step has anything to do with this issue.  The instance details: id: i-da0445ba location: N Virginia type: c1.medium  Thanks very much!"
59803,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi,  Tracing back your instance's history, I see no issues with the underlying hosts and also no history of network latencies in your instance's AZ. Unfortunately I cannot comment on the instance's internal configurations as I do not have visibility to it.  However, I would suggest that you inspect the connections active on your instance at the time you next experience this issue. There is high likelihood that you may be suffering some form of dos attacks as your instance is wide open to the world in every respect. It is recommended that management ports like SSH 22 be locked down to known IPs that you use for accessing the instance.   I suggest you run ""netstat"" to have an overview to what program is listening/connected to which port. From there you can tell whether you are getting fishy connections to your instance.  Regards,  Tonderai."
59803,Amazon EC2 V0,"Thanks for your quick response!  I do check activities using netstat and so far I haven't noticed any increase in activity around these times. Of course, I cannot check this right when the issue occurs since the server is completely inaccessible during that time - no ssh, web anything.  I have locked down ssh further and hardened system users access so I'll check further in the next few days.   Is there a way to check logs when this issue occurs (i know I can check console log from the aws console but am i able to check any other logs)? Perhaps that may help figuring out whats happening then...  thanks!"
59803,Amazon EC2 V0,"As a follow up, since the last post, I hardened the ssh access and all other services running on the server (now only httpd, ssh, mysql and ftp). I have turned off all other services. Here's a ps -ef list. But in the last week, the server has stopped responding twice already... At this point, I cannot access any of the services, ssh, web, ftp etc.  Not sure what can I do at this point...move to a new instance location, create a new server? Hate to do all that to see this happening again  Would be most grateful for any insight or guidance into resolving this...  thanks very much!

59802,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi  Once you've created a VPC, you can create subnets within the VPC's IP scope."
59802,Amazon EC2 V0,"so there can be overlapping subnets in aws and my corp lan?  I can have both 10.50.0.0/16 in aws and 10.50.0.0/16 in corp?  The on my corp, how does a user know where sserver say 10.50.0.15 is ?  If the server is on aws, how do they know how to get to it? Also if I create a server with same ip on my corp lan, will there be an ip conflict?"
59802,Amazon EC2 V0,"You can specify the IP address associated with an instance when you create it. If you really want the two networks to have the same IP address range, you're going to need to look into the capabilities of your firewall/VPN device. It may need to forward requests that normally don't get forwarded across a VPN. Packets like DHCP requests or DNS inquiries. The features are usually in the advanced settings of the VPN or network sections. DHCP helper and DNS helper are examples.  It may be easier to keep the networks separate with different subnets and infrastructure services."

59800,Amazon EC2 V0,"Mark,  We have investigated this issue for you and I can confirm there are no issues with the underlying hardware.

Now it seems I cannot login via RDP to the instance, it just disconnects immediately.  I know the server is running properly, because the webserver is responding and serving the website.  If I could connect to the console (or have someone from AWS do it), I should be able to remove the Thinstuff software to fix the problem.  Any thoughts?  Thank you, James"

59799,Amazon EC2 V0,"Thanks Matt.  I tried that, and it didn't work - it just immediately disconnects.  Are there any other options to connect to the console outside of RDP?"
59799,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  Unfortunately, since there is no console access in our environment, if you cannot RDP in, your options are limited.  If this instance contains critical data, you can recover this information from its EBS volumes.  Alternately, you can stop the instance, mount its root EBS volume (or a volume created from a snapshot of this volume) to another instance and attempt to modify the registry.  For example, if you can disable the Terminal Services role, Windows should revert back to accepting up to 2 simultaneous RDP connections.  The downside to this approach is that even if you can make the appropriate registry edits, mounting a bootable volume to another Windows instance will make it unbootable.  You would then need to use bcdedit to restore the bootability of the volume before reattaching it to the original instance.  Please keep in mind that stopping an instance will delete any information stored on an instance store volume.  The link below goes into more detail on this type of storage:  http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html  Regards,  Matt R."

59798,Amazon EC2 V0,"ELB - A transient error occurred only when receiving traffic We have two load balancers in our production environment. One is receiving all traffic for multiple domains. For various reasons we are trying to move one of our domains from the first load balancer to the second. These load balancers are nearly identical configuration and have the same set of back end servers in them. There should not be any scalability or connectivity issues as the backend is the same.  Before moving the traffic, the second load balancer shows all hosts as healthy and passing checks. Once we move traffic over to it, all nodes suddenly fail with ""A transient error has occurred. Please try again later."" and the entire pool goes down. We move traffic back to the first load balancer and 10 to 15 minutes later all instances go into ""Instance registration is in progress"" for a few minutes, then everything returns to healthy.  The only cause I can think of is the volume of traffic: we are moving roughly 800k connections per minute from one load balancer to the other. Is it possible the second load balancer needs to be prepped for the very large volume of traffic we are about to send to it? I am not aware of any way to do this.  The load balancer we are moving from is: my-load-balancer-803248070.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com  The load balancer we are trying to move to is: live-elb-397914312.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com  Again I want to stress that the servers receiving connectivity behind ELB are identical. There shouldn't be any kind of connectivity or load issue with the volume of traffic as the old and new ELB are almost identical. The only difference is the port they connect to, but the same service (haproxy) on the same servers are responding on both ports. We use a different port to better handle traffic patterns."

59795,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi,  If you sign up and use resources on the 15th, anything above the Free Tier would be metered up to the end of the month and billed to your credit card within 3 days into the next month.  When we fail to charge your or verify your credit card we will send out an email to the email address to the account informing you of the failed charge. If this happens at the end of the billing period we will notify you to update your payment instrument via this link:  http://aws.amazon.com/edit-payment-method  I hope this helps.  Ashley."

59795,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi Prateek,  If I'm understanding you correctly, we prorate our billing here for just about all of our services, down to the per-hour rate, and as Ashley mentioned, any non-Free Tier resources would be metered up to the end of the month, so if you start at the middle of the month and you only use 2 hours worth of resources by the end of the month, then that's all you'll be billed for.  If it helps, you can also check our online calculator here. It's a good way to estimate your billing based on your average usage:  http://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html"

59791,Amazon EC2 V0,"What Amazon tier should I have ? I have recently started using AWS, and so far I am still using the free tier (everything free, to see if I like it).

Should you require any further assistance, please let us know and we will gladly assist further.   Kind regards,  Belynda"
59789,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi Coenraad (or anyone else who can answer this),  I am trying to do the workaround mentioned here by you. How does one swap out the root Windows Volume? I detached the root volume and tried to attach my volume as /dev/sda1 (which is what the root volume was attached as before) and it attaches.  But when I try to start the instance, it never launches. It fails the self check where no connections can be made to the machine. Both volume and the AMI that I used before swapping are the same Windows Server 2012 image.  Any suggestions would be helpful.  thanks, john"

I have had the instance for nearly a year and have connected to it many many times.  However, I tried connecting to my server today with the Remote Desktop Client, but I get the following error:  Remote Desktop can't connect to the remote computer for one of the following reasons:  1) Remote access to the server is not enabled. 2) The remote computer is turned off. 3) The remote computer is not available on the network.  I tried stopping the server, and re-starting it.  But, I still couldn't connect.  I then tried re-downloading the Remote Desktop Client from AWS again.  In doing so, I noticed that the IP address of my instance changed.  I thought perhaps that was the issue.  But, when I tried to connect with the new Remote Desktop Client and the new IP address, it still didn't work.  I didn't change anything on my AWS server the last time I logged on (maybe about 3 weeks ago), so I'm really puzzled about why I can't connect.  I primarily use this server as a web server.  When I access it directly with my web browser, my web sites are displaying fine.  So, the server is definitely running...I just can't get to it.  Any ideas?  Thanks!!"
59779,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  I have taken a look at the instance that you have running on your account and I see that it is correctly responding to RDP requests. I attempted to connect with the IP address x.x.x.74 and I am being prompted for username and password so it does appear to be working.  I do see that you are running a t1.micro instance and that it is under rather heavy load. I see that your instance spikes to 100% a lot of time. t1.micro instances only provide bursty CPU capacity when additional cycles are available. You may want to consider increasing your instance type to a m1.small for constant performance. Micro instances are explained here: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts_micro_instances.html  Regarding your IP address changing, this will happen on EC2 classic when you perform a stop/start of your instance. Both IP addresses will change, the public address and your private address. You can attach an EIP to your instance which will essentially be a static address. When you perform a stop/start on your instance, the EIP will be dissociated from your instance however, you will be able to reattach it back to your instance.

Each app would be owned by a specific customer.  Do we setup a single VPN and set up various subnets?  Or would a VPC per customer application be required?"
59774,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  That's honestly up to you.  It strikes me that going the route of one VPC per customer would likely be best from a security perspective, but it will complicate maintenance as you will likely need a VPN to each individual VPC.

59771,Amazon EC2 V0,"Paul,  You can do this with a Scheduled Task (Windows) or a cron task (Linux) but both must be running on a machine that is left running continuously -- you can't set up an AWS instance to automatically start at a given time.

Here are the steps I've tried: Created an IAM User called evan Gave the user evan the permission policy: AmazonEC2FullAccess Generated an SSH-2 (RSA) key using Putty Key Generator Copied the generated public SSH key Saved the private key as a .ppk file In the EC2 Console under Key Pairs, I imported my public key using the ""Import Key Pair"" button and pasting the public key I had copied from the generator In Amazon OpsWorks, under Users, I imported my IAM Users, and clicked edit for the user evan Next, I pasted the my public key in the Public SSH Key text block I logged onto my instance (using Putty) using the ubuntu user (root user) and a key I created on the site when I launched the instance I followed the instructions here: http://utkarshsengar.com/2011/01/manage-multiple-accounts-on-1-amazon-ec2-instance/ to create a user on the actual instance and add its public key to the instance's authorized keys (but used evan in place of the user john)  Whenever I try to log in as user evan using putty with my private SSH key file, I get the following error: ""Server refused our key. Disconnected: No supported authentication methods available  (server sent: publickey)."" I've also tried adding the public key directly to the file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys rather than /home/evan/.ssh/authorized_keys but that has not fixed it. I've also tried terminating the running instance, launching a new instance and re-trying all of the steps, but nothing changes.

All ports in a security group are open but only to my IP-address.  I have succesfully set up Microsoft iSCSI Target 3.3 there. Standart port 3260 is open with Windows Firewall. When I connect to my server with external address (built-in Windows 7 iSCSI initiator), I can discover target portal, but can't connect any disk device (initiator application just hangs for a minute and then shows a non-informative error).  BUT, if I connect to the same server first througn SSTP VPN and then connect to iSCSI target using server VPN address 192.168.x.x everything works like a charm! First idea was something with TCP ports, which are fully accessible to each other only inside VPN connection, but as I mentioned earlier, server is fully open to my client IP on both TCP and UDP protocols.  I don't know details of iSCSI protocol but here is my idea: As you know, EC2 instances have internal Amazon network IP-addresses (10.x.x.x in my case) and whole instance don't really ""know"" what external IP it have. So, during protocol handshake, server target ""tells"" initiator internal address instead of external elastic IP. As a proof of this idea I saw internal IP (which I never typed somewhere) appeared on target portals list.  If so, are there any ways to fight it?

59761,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  It seems this is not really an AWS question as much as a Windows question.  It sounds like what you are doing is spanning disks.  This is a feature in Windows which allows it to combine multiple partitions to appear as a single volume.  All you needed to do is add a 3rd 1TB volume and then expand the existing 2TB volume using it.  See the following for more info: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc772180.aspx  I would like to advise you that this is not the best idea.  Every time you add an additional spanned disk, you are decreasing the durability of the volume.  If you lose any of the spanned partitions, you lose the entire volume.  Since each partition is presumably on a different disk, and each disk has it's own failure rate, for each disk you add you are increasing the risk of failure.  For example, say you have a volume composed of 1 disk and that disk has a 1% failure chance over a given time period.  Now lets say you have another volume composed of 10 disks and each of those 10 disks has a 1% failure chance.  The volume composed of 1 disk has a 1% chance of failure but the volume composed of 10 disks has a 10% chance of failure.  A much better idea would be to utilize some sort of RAID which provides protection against disk failures.  RAID5 is supported by Windows, but you would need to add two 1 TB volumes to get to 3 TB capacity."
59761,Amazon EC2 V0,"Not sure this helps.  If consolidating disk is what you are trying to achieve, simply use junction points.  You can have independent 1T disks but mounted to folders or have junction pointing to other drive/folders."

59760,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  There are several methods to move a large quantity of data into EC2, including the use of FTP/SFTP, moving the data into S3 and copying down into EC2, or utilizing our Import service to physically ship a drive to us to import into a EBS volume. It will depend on your preferences for cost / speed / security. I will provide some information below and hopefully it will help shed some light on this inquiry.

Regarding the methods you pointed them out, I did try the S3 option, however after about 5-6 hours of uploading and when 85% of data upload was progressed, suddenly it gave me error indicating the upload failed. The FTP option is a bit tricky in my case as our network provider does not allow FTP connection! The data shipping on hard drive is an open option, but depends on how long it takes to complete the import job in Amazon side (excluding the shipping time). I could not find this information in the documentation.   Would you please comment on this as well?  Thanks in advance,  Mon"
59760,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi there,  If for whatever reason your upload jobs keep failing when directly uploading to S3, you can also see if going through an EC2 instance first is something that could help. After the data has been uploaded, provided it's successful, you may have better luck migrating that data from that instance to S3.  As for the on-site import job, the time it takes to complete depends on the current queue of data igestion job have at the time of arrival and how much data each one has. That being said, I encourage you to do the math on your end to see how much data you have to transfer and how quickly you can do it through the normal channel to see if this is worth it.  For more information, check out the FAQ:  http://aws.amazon.com/importexport/faqs/  More specifically, scroll down and look for ""When should I consider using AWS Import/Export?"" and ""How long does it take to load my data?"" These should give you a fair idea on what this process looks like and how to proceed.  Cheers!"

59759,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello Ed,  Unfortunately it can take some time for packages to be built, tested and made available via the YUM repository system. But additionally not all packages may be approved, a package may be found to have a bug or potentially cause incompatibility issues with other packages that use it. Those Linux's of a commercial nature are also quite similar, its all about stability and compatibility before a package is approved for production release.  Your best option at this point in time may be to build and install from source your Apache Tomcat if you need the later release. However, I would recommend installing into a completely separate directory so as to ensure you do not interfere with the YUM installed package, this will make it easier to upgrade using ""yum upgrade apache-tomcat -y"" when a new release is available.  Regards,  Davin G."
59759,Amazon EC2 V0,"Ok, that sounds like packages are continually being worked on but we don't have a published schedule.  Is there a way to tell the difference between these three scenarios?    package X is bad and will never be available in the repository package X is being worked on package X has not been looked at yet   That would help me to decide the best course of action.  Thanks!"
59759,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi Ed,  Yes that is correct. We do not have a published schedule and not all updates of a particular package can be built, tested and delivered in a timely manner. Some Open Source projects as I'm sure you realize are much more aggressive in releasing packages and can potentially release numerous upgrades all within a short time frame depending upon the number of developers and reviewers involved. The other side of this is that with a large number of releases in a short time frame it is entirely possible for a potential bug to be included in a specific release that is then addressed within a short time frame by either correcting it or removing it. In a commercial environment we are about stability and reliability for our customers, hence a package within a repository may be slightly behind the current released version.  In regards to the three scenarios there is no way to tell the difference between them. I can confirm this specific package has been brought to the attention of our development team for consideration and they are looking at it. However as to if or when it will be released we do not have a release date.  In the meantime though I would recommend you read the release notes for Tomcat 6.0.39 and 6.0.38 to decide whether there is something that is of major concern. If not then stick with the current release of 6.0.37 but if there is then your best option will be to build from scratch and install it. If you do decide to go with building from source then I would also suggest taking a snapshot of your instance before installing, you will then have a method for effectively rolling back prior to the installation and once a new package is available be able to use yum to upgrade. But please do read the Release Notes for both 6.0.38 and 6.0.39 before deciding either way.  Regards,  Davin G."

The problem is that when connecting to a specific port on the machine 14008, 14010 the socket times out.  This has been up and running for months.  I restarted the java application running on that port with no effect.  I have not rebooted the server yet.  Edited by: egoscueepete on Feb 20, 2014 9:45 AM"
59757,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  Thank You for responding the forum post. Firstly a socket timeout means that: you are trying to connect to the instance on that particular port and there is no response from the service that is running on that port.  Since, it is a custom java application running on this port, I apologize we will not be able to investigate it further. You might also want to increase the socket timeout on your java application: http://www.javaworld.com/article/2076498/core-java/simple-handling-of-network-timeouts.html  I have double checked your instance and the instance seems to be healthy, up and running. I also see the underlying hardware is healthy. If the issue is only related to receiving socket timeouts with that particular port, I would suggest you to check the following:  During the issue, check if the service on those ports are running Try increasing the socket timeout and then test the application   Thanks, Sneha"

59754,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  Thank You for creating this forum post.   Each instance that you launch into a VPC has a default network interface. The network interface specifies the primary private IP address for the instance. If you don't select a primary private IP address, we select an available IP address in the subnet's range. You can specify additional private IP addresses, known as secondary private IP addresses. Unlike primary private IP addresses, secondary private IP addresses can be reassigned from one instance to another.   Please note, each instance will only have 1 primary private IP address assigned, all other additional private IP addresses will be listed under the Secondary Private IPs. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/MultipleIP.html  Thanks, Sneha"

59749,Amazon EC2 V0,"I don't know what OS you're running, and I can't look inside your machine, but I can make a few guesses.  The first line means that something sent a signal to your system logger daemon to flush its log files.  This usually happens when a log rotation is happening.  During log rotation a number of other processes also get nudged like this.  In addition to flushing their log files, some also use this opportunity to reload their configuration files.  However, when your web server tried to reload, it appears to have found an error in its config files, and so it was unable to restart itself.  Init retried a number of times just in case it was a transient error, but was never successful, and eventually gave up.  You should check your httpd config files for syntax errors, and think back to any changes you've made in the last week or so.  For Apache you can use Apachectl to check your files. There should also be an error log somewhere (Maybe in /var/log/httpd/) that should show more information."
59749,Amazon EC2 V0,"Yeah, actually I think we can forget the first line, since I don't believe it's causing any issues to me.  Regarding the httpd errors, the problem is that the error is intermittent, so I wouldn't say it's related to any configuration issues. And, to make things worse, I don't see anything at /var/log/httpd/error_log once this issue happens...  Anyway, thanks for your answer. If you have any other idea that could cause the httpd process to die (and keep trying to ""respawn"") other than a config issue, please share with me."

59748,Amazon EC2 V0,I think the netstat output you have shown suggests that you are only listening to port 8000 on the loopback address (127.0.0.1). I would expect to see listening on 0.0.0.0:8000 (but I could easily be wrong!)
59748,Amazon EC2 V0,yea i am trying to figure that out.  hopefully an amazonian will come to the help.
59748,Amazon EC2 V0,"node.js is only listening on the loopback address 127.0.0.1.  That is s the default address. You need to specify an address to listen on when you specify the port.  So in your node program you will need to have a line like: .listen(8000,""0.0.0.0"");  I hope this helps."

59746,Amazon EC2 V0,"EC2 DNS - nameserver records taking 24+ hours to update inside EC2 Hi,  I'm Ryan, we run an EC2 environment out of Northern California.  Currently seeing an issue with DNS inside of EC2 taking a very long time to update.    What is the default caching policy for DNS inside EC2?  Should updates take this long (24+ hours) to propagate?    Scenario: 1.  Our domain expired and our nameservers changed to GoDaddy default parked nameservers.  This change was immediate - AWS almost instantly updated to the parked nameservers.  2.  We quickly fixed the expired domain and changed the nameservers on GoDaddy back to pointing to Route53.  3.  DNS quickly updated and works everywhere except inside Amazon EC2.  Even 24 hours later, we still see the old GoDaddy parked nameservers inside EC2.  Inside Amazon all impacted machines are hitting DNS server - 172.16.0.23  Edited by: tpsops on Feb 19, 2014 1:58 PM  Edited by: tpsops on Feb 19, 2014 2:02 PM"

59746,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi,  I sent the information in a PM.   The situation has improved a little bit - we now see the correct DNS in our environment, but DNS is still hit and miss."
59746,Amazon EC2 V0,"I seem to be getting the Route 53 name servers consistently when querying from an instance in the N. California region. There is a very low TTL, 300 seconds, on the NS record set. That can explain why the new name servers were used almost instantly. As the DNS resolver isn't allowed to cache the NS information for very long, it will more or less constantly need to figure out what name servers are associated with the domain. So the DNS resolver detected the change really fast due to the TTL. On the GoDaddy side, I would assume there is a much higher TTL. Haven't seen anything related to GoDaddy when querying the AWS DNS resolver, so it's hard to be more specific, though. If I were to make an educated guess, I would say that the new TTL caused the delay. That doesn't fully explain why AWS was the last one to find Route 53 again, but a DNS resolver would need to have seen the GoDaddy name servers during the period when you had been moved away from Route 53 in order to be affected."
59746,Amazon EC2 V0,"Just an update - looks like it reverted.  The DNS Nameservers are flapping back and fourth.  If you look at the screenshot - the nameservers resolved property to awsdns (top)  then reverted back again to ns40.domaincontrol.com and ns39.domaincontrol.com.  This happens even though we are not making changes to our nameservers and is only happening in AWS.    This is on AWS DNS server 172.16.0.23  Thanks,  Ryan"
59746,Amazon EC2 V0,"What we think of as ""the"" AWS DNS resolver is probably a very large deployment with independent caches. So you might get different results depending on what part of the system you hit.  If you run the command with debug enabled, you will also get information about the remaining TTL in seconds. That allows you to at least figure out when the old information should be dropped.  nslookup -querytype=NS -debug example.com"

It looks like somehow the DNS is flapping on 172.16.0.23  No, haven't seen that, so it would be interesting if you can figure out the TTL as mentioned in my previous post. The GoDaddy name servers doesn't want to handle queries for your domain, which means that I'm not getting any useful information from there. But the AWS DNS resolver can at least tell you about the remaining TTL for the cached data."

59745,Amazon EC2 V0,Request for Instance Store (S3) HVM AMI enabled on g2.2xlarge Could the Amazon Linux AMI 2013.09.2 Instance Store (S3) HVM AMI please be enabled on g2.2xlarge?  us-east-1: ami-b7a38fde us-west-2: ami-0cf2973c us-west-1: ami-34390971 eu-west-1: ami-8659b7f1  I am aware that I have to take care of the drivers myself.  Thanks!
59745,Amazon EC2 V0,I've enabled G2 support on all of the Amazon Linux 2013.09.2 HVM AMIs. Thanks for your interest!
59745,Amazon EC2 V0,"Thanks Tom, I successfully ran a G2 instance with ami-b7a38fde  However, after making changes to the instance and then storing them as my own Instance Store-Backed AMI, trying to launch a new G2 instance from that also gives: ""Instances of type 'g2.2xlarge' may not be launched from AMI 'ami-b76f5fde' (400 response code)""  Can you enable my AMI (id is in error) for G2 please?  Is there a way I can enable my own HVM AMIs to run on G2 instances? It would be a hassle if I have to request this for every AMI I create. I suppose it has something to do with metadata in the image.manifest.xml?  Thanks!  Edited by: muxing on Jan 13, 2014 2:02 PM"
59745,Amazon EC2 V0,"Could someone at Amazon look into this please?   I'm guessing other customers might be having the same issues. If every single AMI has to be whitelisted to work on specific instance types, this doesn't really add to the utility of these instance types.  It's understandable that the Amazon team might want to discourage non-approved AMIs because customers might call on support because of hassles with drivers and such, but an option to ""whitelist"" AMIs yourself (with an added warning about possible issues) would be very valuable.  I would like to experiment with newer kernels and drivers and such, and then store these as working G2 Instance Store AMIs. As of now, this is not possible.  Edited by: muxing on Jan 14, 2014 5:42 AM"
59745,Amazon EC2 V0,"We are using this mechanism to promote a positive customer experience working with the GPU, and we strive to maintain broad coverage of operating systems for HVM AMIs.  Note that an AMI created from a whitelisted AMI should also be whitelisted.  We are continuously open to feedback on the experience and ways to improve.  Your feature request has been sent to the service team.  Edited by: John P. on Jan 14, 2014 1:33 PM"
59745,Amazon EC2 V0,"Thanks for your explanation John.  I already thought it was about making it easier to get started with GPU instances, and that is commendable.  However I think not allowing any non-whitelisted AMIs at all is a bit overkill. A serious warning should suffice. Something like:  ""WARNING: You are trying to launch an instance with an AMI that is untested for this instance type."" Maybe with a link to the GPU instances documentation.  You said: Note that an AMI created from a whitelisted AMI should also be whitelisted. That is not what I experienced while creating an instance-store backed AMI from a G2 instance running ami-b7a38fde, using the ec2-bundle-vol, ec2-upload-bundle, ec2-register procedure, taking care to set --virtualization-type hvm. Do you have any guidance on how to do it right?  Also, it would be nice to have the Arch Linux HVM AMIs whitelisted, ami-9f2413f6 for example.  Cheers, Marnix"
59745,Amazon EC2 V0,Any update from Amazon on this issue?
59745,Amazon EC2 V0,"The AMI whitelisting functionality is temporary, and it will be removed in the near future.  We will be updating this thread once we remove the functionality, and for now, please provide the AMI ids you would like whitelisted.  If I have any questions about the AMI, I'll send you a private message.  Note there are known issues with the open source nouveau GPU driver, so one step to take before offering an AMI for whitelisting is to blacklist the nouveau driver and install the NVIDIA driver.

I tried importing several exported OVF until I got one that actually booted up successfully. However, there were two things wrong with this import that was unexpected.   1) The upload did not add the server to the correct subnet ID. I confirmed beyond doubt that the subnet selected in the command was with the right subnet ID. Instead the instance got dropped into a default subnet and I had to manually move it to the correct one. No big deal, just wanted to ask.   2) There were two volumes created in the new EC2 vm. The C: drive is correctly provisioned at 99 GB. There is an additional D: drive with a 399.96 GB capacity that I did not create. In addition, there are no EBS volumes that are in my AWS console at that size.

Intermittently the forwarder stops resolving AWS hostnames with their internal IPs and returns the public IPs instead. Does anyone else have this problem? Can someone point me in the right direction for a solution?  Thank you, Jeremy"

59738,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi xaossystems,  The EC2 DNS server should always return the internal IP address, as per your expectations. I have checked the particular DNS server your sample instance is communicating with and have not been able to re-create the issue you are experiencing.   In order to investigate further, could you please help with the following questions:  1) Is 172.16.0.23 the only forwarder you have configured in your DNS server?  2) Are you seeing this issue if you directly query the EC2 DNS server, or only when you query via your internal DNS server?   Regards,  Alastair"
59738,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello Alastair,  Yes, 172.16.0.23 is the only forwarder configured. We never query the EC2 DNS server directly.  We have configured a cron job that checks for public IPs in AWS hostname resolution and when the DNS is misbehaving it restarts the bind9 service in order to clear its cache and sends us an alert.  On Nov 14 approximately between 18:00 and 18:45 CET the problem occurred many times. Last time we had and alarm was on Nov 17 at 11:14 CET.

59738,Amazon EC2 V0,"I've done some testing. So, querying 172.16.0.23 directly from our DNS server does in fact return the private IP, even when the server is returning the public IP to the clients.

59735,Amazon EC2 V0,"If a volume is created from a snapshot is it important to retain the snaps Hi,  I have a 250GB EBS attached to an Instance. There was a need to expand the volume to 600GB. As per a document I created a snapshot of existing 250GB volume (it took a lot of time than I expected... nearly 7 hrs or more for 160GB data). I used the snapshot to create 600GB volume, which was super fast, as if, it did not write any data.  Now, under the Volumes section, 600Gb shows the snapshot id it was created from. What if I delete the snapshot? Will it affect the data on the new Volume?"
59735,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  To answer your question, no. Deleting the snapshot that you created your volume from will not affect the data on the volume.  The amount of time to takes to complete a snapshot depends on the amount of data that is on the volume. Generally, the first snapshot that you create will take a little longer than subsequent snapshots as EBS snapshots are incremental. Only the blocks on the device that have changed after your most recent snapshot are saved.  The creation of your volume would of taken place relatively quickly as new volumes that are created from snapshots load lazily in the background allowing you to use them right away. If your instance accesses a piece of data that hasn't yet been loaded, the volume immediately downloads the requested data from Amazon S3, and then continues loading the rest of the volume’s data in the background.

59730,Amazon EC2 V0,"AWS and HIPAA since the information provided by Amazon here (http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2009/04/06/whitepaper-hipaa/) is a bit dated at this point (at the very least, it predates Amazon's recent decision to sign BAAs w/customers), I thought I'd throw a few questions out here...  1) Can RDS be used in a HIPAA-compliant application? 2) Can regular shared-tenancy EC2 instances be HIPAA-compliant or are dedicated instances required to meet compliance?  I understand of course that nothing provided in this forum is legally-binding advice... just looking for peoples' thoughts and understanding of these issues. thanks"
59730,Amazon EC2 V0,"First, I'll include a few words from an AWS representative that were sent in response to an inquiry I made.  •	Customers must identify to AWS each account to be covered by the BAA as a 'HIPAA Account'.  •	Customers may process, store or transmit PHI only on EC2, S3 and EBS. •	Customers must use Dedicated instances for PHI data - http://aws.amazon.com/dedicated-instances/ •	Customers must use VPC •	Customers must encrypt all PHI in accordance with certain minimum encryption standards •	Customers may use any AWS service in their 'HIPAA Account' for data that is not PHI  So, to get a BAA agreement from AWS you'll need dedicated instances running in a VPC, not the ""classic"" EC2.  (Pricing for dedicated instances has come down a lot since the very beginning.)  I cannot answer your question about RDS.  I know RDS can be made quite secure, using SSL over port 443, but I'm not even sure that is the key issue.  Hopefully somebody else will comment.  James"
59730,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello James,  The only suggestion I can really recommend as there are a lot of factors to bear in mind when it comes to HIPAA and general compliancy/certification is to read through our documentation at http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/ but also I would highly recommend contacting AWS Sales and Business Development, they will be able to provide additional guidance and recommendations.  I would also recommend requesting the AWS Compliancy Pack using the following page - http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/contact/.  Regards,  Davin G."

59725,Amazon EC2 V0,"We started to have ELB problem Monday morning. ELB stopped all requests to both backend instances. ELB responded to any request with 503. AWS Console https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-east-1#s=LoadBalancers stated both backend instances were ""In Service"".  We by-passed ELB and routed 67% traffic to one backend instance, the rest 33% to the other backend instance.  Contacted AWS support -- AWS support ignored the fact both backend instances are not being contacted by ELB -- and simply concluded that our 2 backend instances are the problem and needed more backend instances.  We checked for ELB every 3 minutes using cron on Monday. For 6 hours, the only request to ELB was the check from cron. And ELB kept responding with 503. After 6 hours, ELB started to forward the request from cron to backend instances.  On Tuesday afternoon, we started using ELB again. Couple hours later, we ran into the same problem -- ELB stopped forward requests to backend instances.  My workaround was to remove a backend instance and add it back. A few seconds after the remove and add to ELB, that backend instance started to receive traffic from ELB. So, I did the same for the other instance. That worked for many hours.  Today, at around 1PM EST, ELB started to forward ALL traffic to only ONE instance. The other instance received no traffic from ELB.

59723,Amazon EC2 V0,"Disaster Recovery Question - SQL Server DR Techniques Hi All,  I am looking for a good DR technique for EC2 for an RPO and RTO of 24 hours (preferably less). I have servers that require high amounts of iops and storage. Doing something like asynchronous mirroring or log-shipping to AWS works fine, however, we can't leave storage with PIOPS online all the time due to financial constraints. This is unfortunate because with EBS volumes already set up and available, I can get an RTO of about an hour, max 2.   Because I can't have these volumes running constantly, and because you can't allocate more iops once a drive has been created, I've been thinking about other ways to do this. I thought about maybe setting up a low-level instance with a slow drive, copying backups nightly (maybe with some differentials), and then when the time comes, creating some fast drives, upgrading the instance, and then restoring the data to the new drives. However, copying backup files to Amazon takes a total of close to 20 hours, so that's out of the question. I guess I could do a single database backup on the production environment once a week and then just running differentials, but I'd rather not change our backup procedures. I've also been thinking about doing log-shipping to an always on server that has slow drives, and then like with database backups, when DR is necessary, creating new drives and then moving the databases to those new and faster drives.  The other option I've been considering due to how expensive all of this already is, is to buy a couple new servers with SQL Server, putting them in a data center with a direct connect to Amazon, do some log-shipping to the new server, and then connecting the apps at EC2 to that physical location. This is a last resort as I'm not sure about performance, although I've heard DC is very very fast.  Any thoughts or opinions would be greatly appreciated.  Edited by: JF_DBA on Feb 19, 2014 10:07 AM"
59723,Amazon EC2 V0,"Not all instance types will support PIOPS volumes, so you might check out the least expensive instance type that actually WILL support PIOPS volumes.  I like your log shipping idea, at least, given your parameters.   You might build your EC2 SQL Server initially with, say, mounting a regular non-PIOPS volume to \Databases.  Have an empty folder named \Recovery too.  On disaster day, create a PIOPS EBS volume, stop the instance, detach the original non-PIOPS volume and attach the new PIOPS volume in its place at \Databases.  Then, associate the original EBS volume, (the one with the most current data), as \Recovery on that same instance; copy the files from \Recovery to the new and faster \Databases.  From there you should be able to fairly quickly do whatever is necessary. ...or, something like that... maybe...  Also, you might not need to change your backup strategy; perhaps continue to do your nightly FULL backups, but only copy one up to EC2 once per week.  Then, continually, copy LOG backups; as long as you have a contiguous unbroken chain of LOG backups since the FULL backups, you can recover.  (For DIFFERENTIALS though, I'm not sure what approach would be best.)  James  P.S. Whatever you decide, actually practice many times.  I probably don't need to mention it, but..."
59722,Amazon EC2 V0,Problems in EC2?  Instances are terminating due to health-checks. I have several instances in an autoscaling group and this afternoon I have received three notifications that instances have been terminated due to system health-checks.  That seems like a lot of instances to be taken out of service by health-checks in a short time period.  Are there any current issues in EC2 that could be causing this?  What would be the next step to track down the cause?

59721,Amazon EC2 V0,"Is there any state between INBOUND and OUTBOUND security group rules? Hello,  I am trying to understand whether it is possible to have the rules of a security group work similar to iptables.  I would like to understand the behavior on the following example:  SG1 - R1: IN 80 OUT 1024  SG2 - R1: IN 1024 OUT 80  As you can see above, I have two security groups that are to be applied to an ec2 instance. One allows to connect from remote port 1024 to local port 80 and the other allows to connect from remote port 80 to local port 1024.  The question is, if I apply both security groups to an ec2 instance, would a connection from remote port 80 to local port 80 or a connection from remote port 1024 to local port 1024 work?  I hope it does not, for the sake of security.  Thank you."
59721,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  I'm afraid not. You cannot currently restrict the source port for network traffic using a security group. It is only possible to restrict the destination port.  Apologies for the inconvenience caused.  Richard"
59721,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello Richard,  You answer is a bit confusing, perhaps because I did not explain that I was talking of security groups within a VPC. My question on whether the rules of one security group affect/merge with the rules of another security group withstands.  Thank you."
59721,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  Security group rules do not ""merge"" in this fashion and there is no way to restrict source port numbers in AWS.  Each security group is independent. In your example, you would be allowing connections to ports 80 and 1024. Inbound connections would be allowed to either of these ports regardless as to which remote port number you were connecting from.  I hope that clarifies.  Richard"
59721,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello Richard,  Please, see the attached files. Looks like I did not understand properly the security group implementation. Can you please detail a bit or point me out to some documentation on the interrelationship between INBOUND and OUTBOUND configurations?  When I specify Inbound 80, and I deny all Outgoing traffic, I do understand that requests to port 80 will be received, but I also understand that upon denying all outgoing traffic, no replies will be sent out back to the source. What is the real behavior?  Thank you for your time."
59721,Amazon EC2 V0,"Looks like I found the answer I was looking for:  http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/GettingStartedGuide/SecurityGroup.html  Inbound rules regulate the traffic that is allowed to reach the instances associated with the security group (the source of the traffic and the listening port on the instance). All return traffic is automatically allowed to reach the instances. For example, if a client on the Internet sends a request to a web server in your VPC associated with WebServerSG, the instance can respond, regardless of any outbound rules on the group. In this way, security groups are stateful.  Outbound rules control which destinations the instances associated with the security group can send traffic to (the destination of the traffic and the destination port). All return traffic (such as a response from the host that received the traffic) is automatically allowed to reach the instances, regardless of the inbound rules set on the security group."

59713,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello Ed Hong,  I have investigated the issue you have encountered and can confirm the problem you have is due to the restrictions for your Security Group.  Currently your security group is configured to only allow access to TCP/3389 from a specific IP Address. For each of your developers you need to obtain their IP Address and update the security group allowing access using the syntax of xx.xx.xx.xx/32 syntax for the RDP service. You will then need to give them the password for the server and they should then be able to log into it.  Also, I noted your instance is a t1.micro, please be aware of the very tight resources contained within that instance type but also the nature of a t1.micro for which I refer you to the following documentation:  T1 Micro Spiky Nature - http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts_micro_instances.html  A t1.micro instance has 1 vCPU resource and varying eCUs and 615MB of RAM. For most Windows environments a standard recommendation for memory is 2GB, at least for a production environment. When it comes to building a base line for your system when you get to the production stage I would highly recommend at least a m1.small instance type as its nature if consistent in terms of resources and using this will give you a better feel for how your application responds.

Thank you in advance for your feedback!  Regards, Szymon"
59712,Amazon EC2 V0,"I just started a t1.micro instance in us-east-1d and it has the same traceroute and connectivity problems.  I then tried a t1.micro instance in us-east-1a and it has the same traceroute and connectivity problems.  I then tried a t1.micro instance in us-east-1e and it has the same traceroute and connectivity problems.  I then tried a t1.micro instance in eu-west and its traceroute worked (via Level3 and then mtnns).  The telnet to the FTPS port (tcp port 990) worked and showed connected.  I then tried a t1.micro instance in us-west and its traceroute worked (via Level3 and then mtnns).  The telnet to the FTPS port (tcp port 990) worked and showed connected.  Unfortunately I'm not getting any real help from South Africa (they can't do a traceroute because it hasn't been allowed through their firewall and all they can use is telnet to diagnose things).  So it would appear to be some sort of routing issue from all instances in us-east to South Africa via Telefonica.  eu-west and us-west are unaffected.  How can such a connectivity issue be escalated with AWS's upstream providers?  It has been about 20 hours without connectivity.    Logs and traceroutes shown below.  from us-east-1d:  root@ip-10-139-60-178 ~# traceroute idp.jse.co.za traceroute to idp.jse.co.za (41.208.2.129), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets  1  100.121.150.1

59712,Amazon EC2 V0,The connectivity issue resolved itself - unfortunately with no real help forthcoming from either AWS  (via these forums) or the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.  Intermediate connectivity issues are painful - I wish there was a better way of trying to diagnose the issues and convince any intermediate connectivity providers that their links are borked.
59711,Amazon EC2 V0,"Port forward from elastic or public IP to internal network? Here is the situation, hopefully somebody can help.  I have an EC2 instance, with a public ip of 54.x.x.x. The instance has a private IP of 176.x.x.x and inside the instance, there is a Virtualbox NAT network of 10.0.2.0/24. I need to be able to direct traffic at certain ports from the public IP, to an address on the 10.0.2.0 network.  Is this possible? I've been reading about iptables but nothing quite like this I could find. This would be very easy for me outside of EC2, since I would have a router I could configure myself and setup the firewall and port forward. Port forwarding through multiple layers of NAT isn't usually a big deal for me either but with EC2 i'm lost.  Any help would be great! Thank you!"
59711,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello Kevin,  I have tried to investigate this for you however I am unable to identify the instance you mention as the operating system for your only current instance is Windows based.  I can see you have the Default VPC configured using the standard settings however I need to ensure you are aware that by running the VirtualBox application within the AWS environment you will not be able to run provision instances using the address space of 10.x.x.x. The reason for this is any instance being deploying into a subnet within the VPC environment will be provided with an address of the subnet range which in this case is 172.16.x.x or 172.31.x.x and not within the 10.x.x.x address space as this is not the range of the VPC.  When you deploy an instance into your VPC by making it public you have a Public IP Address that can be connected to from outside of AWS along with its associated security groups. If you then wish to have an instance in the private subnet connect to an instance in your public subnet you will need to add a NAT instance and enable port forwarding between the two subnets. I recommend a read of the following documentation for how to configure this - http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_NAT_Instance.html.  If you have any further questions please ask.  Regards,  Davin G."
59710,Amazon EC2 V0,"Anti DDOS? I am trying to run some load tests on our web app's entire stack, and I am using apache benchmark (ab) to do hits from one of our servers to our main web app (through the domain, have it go through the loadbalancer, and everything).  I've been doing a few batches of 1000 requests each, and after a number of them, I seem to have triggered some sort of anti-DDOS measure on AWS. I can no longer hit our web app successfully from our servers. However, from my office computer, I can still access our web app fine. I believe our server's range of IPs have been blocked by itself to try to access the site.  How can I find out what's going on, and how can I alleviate it, and how can I prevent this in the future?"
59710,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  From the information you have provided it would sound like you have triggered some form of protective action. We do actively monitor the full AWS environment and for this reason we always advise customers to let us know when they are carrying out testing but also it is entirely possible the requests may have been interpreted as service impacting or potentially not well formed requests.  For us to investigate further can you please provide an Instance ID and we will look further into this to try and assist you.  Regards,  Davin G."

There is vastly more space available on that volume than required for the uncompressed file, so space is not the issue.  Edited by: ericjohannsen on Feb 18, 2014 12:37 PM"
59706,Amazon EC2 V0,A lot of extractors store the temp data on the C: drive / %TEMP% folder instead of on the target volume.  So if you do not have enough free space on whatever volume is holding your temp directory you can see errors like this.  Many times the program will have a setting to change the working directory to overcome this problem.
59705,Amazon EC2 V0,"The m3.* Windows instance types require Citrix PV drivers? I think this is true for Windows, but would like to here from others, or from AWS...  The newer m3.* (possibly other types) types require that your Windows instances have Citrix PV drivers; they simply will not function if the old RedHat drivers are in place.  I recently attempt to change instance type of some ""older"" instances, and after changing to m3.2xlarge the instance would not start.  The logs shows ""waiting for meta-data..."" as if there was no proper NIC on which to communicate.  After a bunch of experiments, it seems that if we upgrade those older Windows instances to use the new Citrix PV drivers, AND THEN change instance type to m3.2xlarge, all is well.  This instances boot and function perfectly.  I'm just wondering if this is documented anywhere, if it is true, if I have it almost right, etc.  Any words or links will be greatly appreciated.

59705,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  I recommend that you take a snapshot of the root volume and create  a new volume before performing these steps.  I would like you to detach the volume and spin up a new Win 2K8 or later instance and attach this new volume as a secondary volume on that instance. Then go take a look at the event logs for the failed instance to see if anything looks wrong.  You will have to browse for the event logs on the drive. /System32/winebtx  Regards,  Matt J"
59705,Amazon EC2 V0,"The only thing I ever saw in the logs was ""waiting for meta-data..."" or something like that.  Note, we are past this issue now; I've upgraded all our older instances to the Citrix PV drivers.  Since upgrading to the Citrix PV drivers, I can change the type of these instance to any m3.* type successfully.  Before I upgraded, when we were still usign the RedHat drivers, changing to any m3.* type resulted in an unbootable instance.  They hung at ""waiting for meta-data"".  My theory was that the m3.* instance types required the latest Citrix drivers in order to fucntion properly.  This post/question is really looking for confirmation of that thought, or some other possible explanation, if any.  James  P.S. Thanks for responding!  If you can help clarify my point above too, that would be huge."

59689,Amazon EC2 V0,"ELB not working I have created an ELB to act as a front-end for a webapp autoscaling group.  Presently I have one instance in the AS group.  When I look at the ELB in the console it shows the instance associated to it with a status of healthy.  The ELB listeners are configured to forward port 80 to port 80.  The instance is in a VPC and does not have a public IP address so all public traffic to the instance has to go through the ELB.  For debugging purposes I have assigned security groups that allow all traffic to/from both the instance and ELB.  If I browse to the private IP address of the instance the webapp loads fine, however if I browse to the ELB DNS name, it fails to connect.  I do not get an error message from the ELB, the browser just says it failed to connect.  I'm not sure what my next troubleshooting step should be.  Any suggestions?"
59689,Amazon EC2 V0,"When you set up an ELB in VPC, you get to select subnets and instances. The ELB itself is supposed to be placed in a public subnet, so that is what you will want to use when asked about subnets. Otherwise the ELB won't be reachable from the outside world. When you have selected a public subnet, you will be able to choose instances from any other subnet in the same availability zone. So the instances themselves can reside in a private subnet. The ELB in the public subnet will be able to talk to them just fine."
59689,Amazon EC2 V0,"That doesn't jive with what I know of ELBs or what I see in the console.  You don't place an ELB in a subnet, you add virtual network interfaces in each subnet in which you have instances you want the ELB to talk to.  Just to be sure, I created a new ELB and it didn't ask anything about what subnet to place the ELB in, only which subnets I wanted to have instances connected to the ELB in.  I don't see a way to verify what subnets an existing ELB has virtual network interfaces in, but I know it has an interface in the subnet containing my instance.  Presumably an instance will not be attachable to an ELB if the ELB doesn't have an interface in that subnet, but I don't know that for sure.  Any other ideas?"
59689,Amazon EC2 V0,"An ELB in VPC that is supposed to be accessed from the Internet needs to be placed in a public subnet. That's basically a subnet with a default route pointing to the Internet Gateway. A public IP address isn't enough, so if you select a private subnet, there is simply no way for Internet traffic to go in and out. The load balancer needs the Internet Gateway. The Management Console has some confusing language, so you have to read between the lines. Note how it talks about availability zone. If you select the instance subnet(s), you might end up with an ELB that is isolated from the outside world. The ELB will only need to have an interface in the same availability zone. It does not need to be placed into the exact same subnet as your instances. If you keep your instances in a private subnet, selecting the public subnet is precisely what you need. As long as both the public and private subnets are in the same availability zone, the ELB can talk to your instances."
59689,Amazon EC2 V0,"So what you're saying is that if I have instances in a private subnet in a given az, I need to have a public subnet (i.e. a subnet with the default route pointed at in igw) in that az as well?

The single instance tied to the ELB at present is in a private subnet in us-east-1a and I have a public subnet in us-east-1a as well but it's still not working.  Just to confirm, you have now selected the public subnet only and then added an instance from the private subnet, right? Does the ELB consider that instance to be in service?"
59689,Amazon EC2 V0,"Ok, I see now.  So the requirements break down like this:  Each az that will contain instances behind an ELB must have a public subnet.  When creating the ELB, you should only select public subnets.  For every private subnet containing instances behind an ELB, a public subnet in the same AZ must be associated with the ELB.  It doesn't matter if instances behind an ELB are in public or private subnets.  Now that I know this I was able to make things work.  Thanks very much for your help!"

59666,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi wooland,  You are correct. Your instance will start generating charges after it is successfully launched on our infrastructure. EC2 instance-hour charges are billed in one hour increments, so a running instance will raise a 1-instance-hour charge when the OS starts booting.   One of the ways you can make your instance accessible more quickly after boot is to create a custom image (AMI) of your instance with your Administrator password embedded (as well as any custom applications and other local users, as you wish). You can create an AMI from an EC2 instance by using the 'Create Image' action available in the EC2 Management Console. After the image is created, you then launch new instances from this image (rather than the standard ones we provide). The instance will launch with the Administrator password that was set at the time of the image being taken, and thus you will not have to use the 'Get Windows Password' function, which can take some time to make the password available.

If you are able to login to your instance, I suggest that you attach an EBS volume as a secondary drive and to migrate your data to the EBS volume.  Here is a link that documents the steps to perform this (converting your instance to EBS backed):   http://cloudunix.blogspot.ie/2012/06/amazon-ec2-migrating-instance-store.html   Generally, when there is an issue with the underlying host, a simple stop/start of the instance will move the instance to another healthy host, however, seeing that you are running instance store volumes this won't be possible as instance store data is lost when the instance is stopped.  I would recommend migrating to an EBS backed instance (EBS instances can be stopped without losing data) which also provides you with the ability to create snapshots of your volume for easier recovery.

59662,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi there,  I'm so sorry. I wish we had more options at this point. Your best bet is to keep trying. With the host at its current state, requests like this becomes undependable and it becomes difficult to predict if/when it will go through. In the event that you're unable to get to this instance, I recommend to start working on recovering your latest backup and start rebuilding your server.  In looking at your resources, I see another non-EBS instance. I would also investigate migrating or converting it to an EBS backed instance. Doing this will give you that ability to take regular snapshots for backup purposes and the ability to detach the volume to be attached to another instance."

Two possibilities that could cause these errors are:  1. The timeout you have configured on your backend instances are lower than that of your ELB (by default, the ELB has a time out of 1 minute). You will need to ensure the timeout on your backend instances is greater than this (for example, 65 seconds).  2. You are using the Mod_reqtimeout module. This module should not be loaded as the ELB handles all internet connections.  Regards Darren R"
59661,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  The 4XX class status code represents client errors, usually this refers to a malformed client http request. It totally depends on how you are doing these calls, also, can be authentication failures too (when client is not authorized to access the requested page).  You can find some additional information on this documentation - http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/US_MonitoringLoadBalancerWithCW.html  Hope this helps? Cheers, Amo"
59661,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi Darren, Amo  You did mention that the 4XX class status code represents client errors.   Can It be because of 404 error page? Our apps nature is to redirect client url. some of the url may end up with 404 page. Does it possibility could be the one of the reason?."
59661,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi there,  That is a definite possibility. As a side note, if the page not found error is actually returning a custom error message page with a 200 OK response code (i.e. from Apache/Nginx redirection), then I don't believe this is being reported as a 4xx error because a standard page is returned."

59655,Amazon EC2 V0,"Importing a VMware image with multiple disks I am trying to determine which would be the appropriate instance type and import procedure for a VMware image that is currently using multiple disks in the OS.   The VM is Windows Server 2008. There are three disks, each with their own vmdk file. I have exported the VM from VMware workstation to OVF and now have 5 files.   server.mf server.ovf serverdisk1.vmdk serverdisk2.vmdk serverdisk3.vmdk   In order for the server applications to startup correctly after booting in AWS, all three drives need to be active and appropriately set with the c:, d: and e: drive letters.  The vmdk are growable drives set with a capacity of 99 GB, and are each currently around 8 GB in size.   My question is regarding how to correctly import this S3>EC2 and which instance type should be chosen.   First, it appears that you can only upload one vmdk at a time using the ec2 command line tools and there doesn't appear to be a way to link the additional vmdk files to the instance before the instance is created with the first import. Is it possible that in this scenario, I should just upload all images to S3 and then manually create an instance? Or am I missing something? I don't want to upload 3 vmdk files that ends up creating 3 instances that all don't work.   Secondly, when reveiwing the instance type details, I'm a little confused regarding the instance storage. The m1.medium is appropriate for my needs, but the instance storage says ""1 x 410"". How does the instance storage listed on this chart work with a vmware image import that has multiple disks?

I want to make sure that I'm actually using the reserved instances. I currently have two instances of the same class running that I reserved. If my time on the reserved instances is going down, does that mean it is in use?  If I launch more instances of the same class, will my reserved instances time expire faster?  Thanks.  Brian"
59654,Amazon EC2 V0,"With a Heavy utilization reservation, you will always be charged for 100% usage each month. If you open up the Billing Management Console, you can see exactly what you are being charged for. You will have one line item showing a charge for the full number of instance hours in the current month, but there will also be a second line item (always $0) displaying how many hours you have actually used. This doesn't matter for billing purposes, but it allows you to confirm that the reservation is being used as expected.  The reservation is valid for a certain period of time. A 1 year reservation purchased today expires a year from now no matter what you have actually used.   A reservation isn't tied to a particular instance, so you can launch and terminate instances as you wish, but only one instance at a time can use the reservation. So if you launch a second EC2 or RDS instance, that one will be charged at the on-demand rate."

I create 10 medium instances for ami-0a96ec63 only 3 of them had the drive properly created. It is an image of a windows 2008 R2 with an ephemeral drive on E. None of the instances create has the drive. I leave one instance running for investigation :  i-07122427   Please advise.
59645,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,   I took a look at the instance and it appears to have an ephemeral storage device attached to the instance, that is matching the device mappings I see in the AMI.   What are you seeing in the Windows Disk Management interface.   Thank you,  Chris"
59645,Amazon EC2 V0,"Thank you Chris,  Just to let you know I contacted AWS support and we solved this issue. The problem was that the ephimeral drive was mounted on D instead of E. Th drive D was supposed to be an ebs drive which instead was not mounted at all. This is causing the instance store to take the next available drive letter for the ephimeral drive, in this case it is D: instead of E:  To work around this you can use the Citrix virtual drivers, which will allow you to control what volumes goes where in terms of drive mappings. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/Upgrading_PV_drivers.html  Also as suggested I updated the EC2Config  and added the driver configuration in EC2Config.

59643,Amazon EC2 V0,"EC2 instance connectivity issue from certain IPs We are facing a peculiar problem with instance connectivity. We have two instances i-2eb84740 and i-3fbca858. We regularly access software running on port 8080 in each of these instances. Our teams access it from two different office locations with IP 182.73.66.121 and 182.72.163.202. Neither of the servers have any IP filtering. Every few days alternate servers become inaccessible from one of the offices. Connectivity to both our offices are provided by the same ISP.  For example: 27 Jan 2014 3:00 PM IST  i-3fbca858 : Accessible from 182.73.66.121, Not accessible from 182.72.163.202  i-2eb84740 : Accessible from 182.72.163.202, Not accessible from 182.73.66.121  The problem usually resolves automatically in couple days only to re-appear again after few days. It's really frustrating to lose access suddenly and not able to identify the root cause."
59643,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  I took a look at the instances you mentioned are you are correct there should be nothing in AWS that would block you IP access. Some things you may want to check would be any firewalls or IPtables in the instances them selves, make sure there is not a script running that could be causing these issues.   You should also check your local firewall or access, again verify that there are no scripts that may be running jobs when you loose connections. Like I stated, there should be nothing that is blocking you on the AWS side.   I hope this helps,   Thanks,  -AdamC"
59643,Amazon EC2 V0,Double checked. No firewall or IP-table inside the instances. We do have a cron job for daily backup but I wonder why such a script would block access (and that too only specific IPs). The cron job runs daily at the same time but our issue shows up randomly. The access issue I posted yesterday got automatically resolved today.  i-2eb84740 is now accessible from 182.73.66.121  Not sure how it got resolved automatically. But most likely it acts up again in a few days time.  Appreciate any additional suggestions for ways to troubleshoot the issue.
59643,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  Looking at the intermittent behavior you have mentioned, I suspect if it's something to do with routing the traffic out from your office locations. If it happens again, could you please attempt a TCP based traceroute and see how far it goes and where the connection gets timed out?  you can do this by running traceroute -T <dest_ip>  Also, you can try and hit a specific port by,   traceroute -T <dest_ip> -p <port no>  And we'll continue troubleshooting from there.

59636,Amazon EC2 V0,"Long running intensive process killed repeatedly Hi,  I have an cc2.8xlarge Instance (i-d2396792) which runs a scientific application for many hours (days/weeks, in fact) computing huge data files for me, under Ubuntu. The data is written to a couple of large files (around 5GB) into my home directory, which has around 33GB free. But... it is being killed (externally) by root every few hours.  I have rewritten the code to not lose too much, and be re-startable, etc, but because I have to go to bed(!) occasionally, I wake up and find my process dead, and the Instance idle. It is a Spot instance, so if the price went up, I'd expect to lose the whole instance - but not just my process.  No Exceptions are generated, and no JVM dump file is created. I am suspecting some kind of watchdog killing my process, maybe OOM problems.... so ....  It is written in Java (with latest JVM), and runs happily elsewhere for days/weeks without problem. It uses all 32 cores, but only about 75% of the physical memory (limited by a -Xmx argument to the JVM), so should not be killed by OOM problems. Just in case, I also configured the ephemeral storage as swap space, just to be sure, but the swap usage remains at zero, and yet the process is still killed.  It could be some programming error, but it is written very robustly, with catches for every Exception, and runs fine on other machines at home for weeks.   Any pointers for things to consider, or tests to perform? It is happily running right now, using ~3000% CPU (or ~90% for normal folk!), but it will not last the night, I expect. Meanwhile, my home machine chugs away, day in, day out, for weeks, same code.  Thanks,  Mi5ke"
59636,Amazon EC2 V0,"Do you see anything in the output of the 'dmesg' command?  If your machine ran out of memory, you would see the kernel messages from the OOM-killer. If they've expired from there, they should also be in your system logs in /var/log.  You might also need to look at ulimits.  Run 'ulimit -a' and see if there's some kind of limit there causing problems.  I think a ulimit kill would have also left a message in the system logs.  The last thought is that your process is attached to a terminal that timed out, and received a HUP.  You could try running your command from nohup or using Gnu Screen.   Otherwise, I can't think of anything in particular that would kill your process."
59636,Amazon EC2 V0,"Michael,  Nothing strange in the dmesg output, usual stuff.  No limits in place of any significance.  A couple of the terminations might have been due to ISP/terminal disconnection - will use nohup in future. But for most, the terminals were still open, connected and working fine.  I suspect most terminations have something to do with memory consumption (despite the lack of relevant system messages), but not so much of my process, but possible periodic consumption by other processes. For example, perhaps some cron job was using significant memory, and my process had to be terminated. I suggest this, as looking at the CPU monitoring graph for the last week, termination seems to occur at about the same time of day each time, apart from one day where it survived. Adding a swap device and swapon command seems to have prevented the terminations (despite my process not using any more memory itself).  Still running now, after two days non-stop. Only another ~5 days to run!  Mi5ke (silent 5)"
59636,Amazon EC2 V0,"The OOM-killer uses a carefully crafted algorithm that calculates the relative value of all the processes on the system, based on their size, how long they've been alive, who started them, and a bunch of other variables. We have no idea why it does all these calculations, since in the end it just kills random processes, and usually the most important ones.    Joking aside, the OOM killer doesn't always kill the process that is using all the memory.  In its mind, a large, long-running process is probably supposed to be there and someone will get angry if it kills it.  So it will often try to kill other processes first.  So, yes, if another process was soaking up memory, it could cause your process to get killed. Alternately, even if your process was soaking up all the memory, other unrelated processes could get killed first.  The  gory details can be found at this site http://linux-mm.org/OOM_Killer or a longer description here http://lwn.net/Articles/317814/ if you're interested.  Still, I don't think you're having memory problems. Not outside the JVM, at least.  You really should have received kernel messages about it if you were.  The OOM killer is not known for being silent... unless, of course, syslog got killed! But even then, you should still have messages in dmesg.  Try running  egrep -i -r 'killed process' /var/log/    For your other theory, things that happen daily would be found in /etc/cron.daily.  Scripts in that directory get run once a day at a somewhat random time, based on some rules that may be found in /etc/anacrontab. Really, nothing in there should be killing your process, either... and nothing in there should be eating up large amounts of memory.  But since you mentioned it dying daily, I figure we should look anyway.  Back to something you said earlier: ""it is being killed (externally) by root every few hours"".  Why do you think this?  Does it say, literally, ""Killed""?  Do you get a java stack trace?  Or does it just go back to a command line?  I hope you're able to get through your dataset soon!  Good luck!  If it does die again, use nohup when you restart it!  Michael (silent h)"

It can take us up to an hour for the instance to launch successfully and be reachable.   This problem started a few weeks ago.  According to my IT person, the Xennet6 issue is an Amazon network issue and is something Amazon should be responsible for fixing. Unfortunately, Amazon has no direct technical support phone number without a charge.  Their billing department is very friendly but they refer you to this forum for help rather than getting a technical support person on the phone.   After our service term is up, we plan on switching to another cloud provider that includes at least some free technical support over the phone for these types of network issues.  At least some ""live"" support should be included in what we already pay Amazon.  We're not asking them for example to fix a problem with Microsoft Word or some third party app.    Does anyone know of a direct phone number to a technical support manager at Amazon so we can get the service we are paying for?

59623,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  Was one of the drives mentioned below used to be the root volume?. Unfortunately, it's not very clear about the sequence of the error messages you've been seeing. Looking at what you have posted, ""An error occurred during the file system check"", it feels like the root volume needs a fsck to be done on it. If your root volume is different from the root volume, you should be able to detach it, attach it to a newly spun up ""dummy"" EC2 instance as a secondary file system and run fsck.  If you could share the instance id with us, we'll be able to take a better look in to the configuration and the full boot time console output. And we can help you from there.  Look forward to your reply, Thank you, Amo"

I was adding an entry on fstab to auto mount on boot the RAID, I was using /dev/md0 to as the device and realised from the System Log that the device during startup was /dev/md127.  Apparently it is very common that it gets changed, the solution is to use either the UUID or the Label of the device.  Cheers"

59622,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi Stephen,  The best solution here may depend on a couple of key factors: 1) What is the size of the data that you will want to initially move over from your EC2 instance to your local machine?  2) How will you synchronize these moving forwards? If you are running a database, will you be using the database management tools to do this? Or will you be copying across the entire database (or database backup) in an ongoing fashion?  3) Depending upon point 2, how much data will you need to transfer from your EC2 instance to your local machine? And on what frequency?  There are a large number of 3rd party applications available that can do file level differentials and synchronization which may also help here.  Best regards, Phil P"
59622,Amazon EC2 V0,"Thanks for replying Phil P.  1. I want to move all the data initially, so it's around 200GB for the running EC2 instance.  I have two more instances that are not running using 30GB and 8GB storage respectably, but I don't know how much data is in there. I want to move all the data even instance is not running.  2. After I move the database, I want to synchronize from my local database to remote database when I need to. I wanted to stop the instance until I get a customer, then when I get a customer I wanted to restart the instance and synchronize at that time.   Is this way sound alright? Do you have recommendations for this?   3. The data I need to transfer would depends on the time I get the customer.  For moving the linux server,   I found this article to set up: http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/migrating-a-linux-server-from-the-command-line-stage-1  This article to start syncing http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/migrating-a-linux-server-from-the-command-line-stage-2  I wanted to use rsync to sync, but I would rather hear from expert on this than going down deep and have unstable server.  Thank you in advance! Stephen"
59622,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi there Stephen,  The Import / Export service may be an option here, but I would suggest that you may want to read through the product information and also review the pricing charges associated with performing an import / export operation: http://aws.amazon.com/importexport/ http://aws.amazon.com/importexport/pricing/  It's also important to note here that the Import / Export service copies data from and to an S3 bucket (can be imported to an EBS volume, but not exported from EBS). So if the data is on your EC2 instance, you will need to transfer it over to an appropriate S3 bucket prior to being exported.  You may find that the cost of transferring data directly from your EC2 instance may* be more cost effective here: http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/ And scroll down to the heading of ""Data Transfer""  As for tools and applications to use to synchronize your data between your local PC and your EC2 instance, it would be great to hear from somebody in the AWS Community to see if they are able to recommend tools or applications for you.

59621,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  Looking at your VPC subnet where your instances reside,  I see that you have specified a rule in your network ACL that only allows port 3389 outbound (egress rule) to 0.0.0.0/0.  Note that network ACLs are stateless and does not dynamically allow established traffic outbound  as your security group ACL does (security groups are stateful).  When you connect to a host on its destination port, in this case 3389, the source port for the destination host will be derived from a dynamic port range (windows 2008 uses the IANA range by default). Seeing that you are only allowing port 3389 outbound, the ACL will drop packets from your instance to the client as the source port is not in the allowed list.   Could you please try modifying acl-b1f3e9d3 to allow all egress traffic to 0.0.0.0/0 and then attempt to RDP into your instance.  Regards Darren R"

59615,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  I noticed that you have attached a couple of different EBS volumes to this instance within the past 24 hours. Looking at the stats of those ones, saw a few occasions where it has reached more than double the provisioned IOPS stayed there for a few hours before it dropped to 0, however, it might not be the reason for broken pipe.  How are you trying to to the extract? Where you do you initiate the operation from? If you use a desktop client (i.e filezilla) it may the ssh timeout breaking the operation.  At this stage,  I would also suspect if it's hitting any file system or user limits on the operating system level such as max file size? During the operation if this happens there is a good chance of throwing this error. Please run a ulimit -a and confirm the user you are using has sufficient limits to handle these files.  Also, if would be great to keep an eye on available space on your file system, memory usage, cpu usage during this operation.  One more quick thing we can try is provisioning more IOPS to the EBS volume and try to continue the copy if none of the above applies to you. And also please let us know and we'll get our teams to help you fixing this problem.  Look forward to your reply. Thanks. Amo"
59615,Amazon EC2 V0,"Amo,  thank you for getting back. Yes, this particular problem seems to be caused by ssh session timeout. As I mentioned in my 'edit' I restarted the extract with 'nohup' and it seems to be running so far (300 of 330GB extracted up to now).  I'm actually surprised that you mentioned some EBS volume hit provision IOPS, I did notice that Windows server I was copying data to sometimes was having troubles with (I suspect) disk subsystem. There are NO error records in application or system log of windows server, but any attempt to get a list of drives or any 'disk management' activity rendered the application unresponsive. If I close rdp session and try to reconnect again connection was established but no login prompt (grey screen) - I guess logon service tries to access disks and freezes as well. Very alarming.  Also, on a bit different topic, it may be related to data transfer though. I experienced connection breaks when transferring data over network between servers in my VPC and those correlate with DHCP lease renew times. I was moving data from Linux (samba server) to Windows machine, and transfer was interrupted because I believe for some moment the windows server lost its IP (there was a message in system log about DHCP renewal failed) - how do I handle this? Few weeks ago I asked on this forum about how to deal with IP allocation but got no response from Amazon team. Basically all I need is a group of fixed IP servers in my VPC. Saving an AMI with fixed IP is not a good idea because I have to specify default router and not sure it always will be .1 address in my subnet, and when I assign an IP or interface to a starting VM it actually ends up as a DHCP assigned address from Amazon cloud orchestration DHCP server (and lease renewal seems to be not always working). Right now I have to start a VM, check what I got in IP settings for GW and DNS and put those in statically - not a good approach at all, definitely not for production environment.  Thanks, Alex"

The account in question is actually a subaccount for another client I'm working for and has its own login url like https://some-client.signin.aws.amazon.com/console . When I try to use the forums logged in with the credentials I have for that, it tells me I don't have permission to post.

59611,Amazon EC2 V0,"Sure, here it is  TestLoadBalancer-2117125046.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com  I have two instances setup on this Load balancer  54.247.174.106 54.228.212.193  I am expecting that when in browser if i browse ""TestLoadBalancer-2117125046.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com"" it will redirect to anyone of the instance based on load to ""54.247.174.106:8081"" or ""54.228.212.193:8081"" but currently it is redirecting to ""54.247.174.106:80""."
59611,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  Your ELB is configured to listen on port 80 for connections and send them to port 8081 on your back-end instances.  I am not 100% clear on the difficulty you are having - right now if you make a valid HTTP request to your ELB DNS name, it will proxy that request to port 8081 on one of your back-end instances?"
59610,Amazon EC2 V0,"No SSH access after reboot (Marketplace AMI) I seem to have been bitten by a fairly common problem... I rebooted my Marketplace instance i-116fee5d in order to increase the volume size and can no longer connect via ssh.  I've tried connecting the volume to another temporary instance, but that doesn't work because it's a marketplace ami (actually one of our own!)  Could some at Amazon please apply the ssh fix so I can get back in?  Many thanks, Mike"
59610,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  The only thing that we can do is take a snapshot of your volume and provide that snapshot to you. Is that what you want?  Regards,  Matt J"
59610,Amazon EC2 V0,"Thanks for the reply Matt.  I wonder if that snapshot will still be tied to a marketplace product id and therefore not mountable as a secondary volume?  If so, the I'll just re-create the instance from scratch; it had nothing on there I can't duplicate easily.  Thanks, Mike"
59610,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi Mike,  I see that your instance and your volume has since been terminated. To answer your question in the event this were to reoccur, the process will be slightly different depending on the type of market place AMI you are using.  If the AMI is a free market place product, we will be able to remove the product code from the snapshot which allows you to mount the volume as a secondary volume.  If however, the market place product is a licensed AMI, we will create a new product code stamped snapshot from the official unmodified product snapshot that will hold the customer's data in a ""Recover"" folder. This is to ensure that the licensed software keeps the product code association.  Regards Darren R"

59607,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  Thank You for creating this forum post. I notice that your vpc instance: i-1967c52d is up and running, but you are unable to RDP into it. The reason behind this is because you have enabled the windows firewall which by default blocks RDP port.  To further troubleshoot this issue, please perform the following steps to disable the firewall on this instance , provided you do not have any important data stored on your instance store volume as the data stored on the instance store volume will be lost when you stop the instance:   Stop the instance:  i-1967c52d Create a snapshot of your root ebs volume attached on /dev/sda1 for a backup: vol-15b77f7c Detach the root volume from this instance Attach as a secondary volume to another similar running instance (preferably in the same availability zone) Bring the secondary volume online on this new instance. For example: if your secondary volume is mounted on E drive, you will then perform the below steps on your new instance:  Launch REGEDIT.EXE, select HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE. Go to File menu, select Load Hive… Browse to this path: E:\Windows\System32\config Select the file SYSTEM (no file extension) When prompted, enter a name (it doesn’t matter what you call it): TEST Go to this location in the registry:             - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\TEST\ControlSet001\Services\SharedAccess\Parameters\FirewallPolicy\PublicProfile\EnableFirewall=0 (DWORD data type)           - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\TEST\ControlSet001\Services\SharedAccess\Parameters\FirewallPolicy\StandardProfile\EnableFirewall=0 (DWORD data type) Click HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE. Go to File, choose Unload Hive Go to Computer Management-->Storage-->Disk Management-->Select the secondary volume and turn it offline.  Detached the secondary volume and re-attach it to the original instance as your root volume on /dev/sda1 Start your original instance:  i-1967c52d, you should now be able to RDP into the instance   Note: we recommend to disable the local windows firewall and restrict access using the security group rules provided to your instance. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html  Useful resources to perform the above steps:  http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-creating-snapshot.html http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-attaching-volume.html http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-using-volumes.html http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-detaching-volume.html   Thanks, Sneha"

59603,Amazon EC2 V0,"EC2 instance unresponsive after simple load test Hi,  We have a m1.medium instance running a Turnkey Linux AMI (ami-8b65f6b1).  It's currently operating perfectly fine with 10 or so virtual hosts (mostly development sites).  Apart from standard, it's also running New Relic (PHP) monitoring.  Yesterday we tried a load test using burst.io with the aim of fine tuning apache and performance and to our surprise the server went down.  At first we assumed it was apache that had crashed but we also lost ssh and other services.  CloudWatch raised no alerts and the AWS console displayed the instance as running.  New Relic showed the instance as down.  We rebooted the instance via console and had a look at the data.  Burst.io only got to 9 connection (memory and cpu loads at the time were perfect - 30% cpu max and memory usage of 500MB) before the failure.  After rebooting we went over every log but cannot find anything.  We repeated the test and sure enough, 9 users and crash.  Any tips to locating the cause, and ultimately having a more robust Wordpress server would be appreciated.  What steps can I take to isolate the cause?"

59600,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  Additional Information on Stop/Start  For more information on performing stop start: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Stop_Start.html  When you stop a running instance, the following happens:  • The instance performs a normal shutdown and stops running (the status goes to stopping and then stopped) • The instance retains its instance ID • Any Amazon EBS volumes remain attached and the data persists. If the EBS volume remain in stuck state, you may try force detach from the EBS volume console. You may have to try force detach several times. Once the volume is in available status, you can attach back to the instance. For more information on force detach: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-detaching-volume.html  • Any instance store volumes don't persist and results in data being lost. • The instance won't keep its public and private IP addresses. The exception is that instances launched in a VPC keep the same IP address when stopped and restarted. • Any Elastic IP address mapped to the instance is unmapped. For Amazon VPC instances, the Elastic IP address remains associated with the stopped instance. When you restart the instance, the Elastic IP address is active. While the Elastic IP address is associated with the stopped instance, you're charged for the Elastic IP address.  Regards,  Marcin"
59600,Amazon EC2 V0,Marcin:  That's a great resource.  The fact that you lose the data on the ephemeral store is a little buried.  Consider making it a separate bullet point from losing data in RAM so that it is emphasized.     Eric Hammond

59596,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi,  Your license fees are included in the hourly run-time charge from Amazon. It's a data center license, so you do not need to (nor are you ALLOWED to) install any license you may already own. As for terminal server/remote desktop service CALs, these can be purchased or installed.  http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs#Can_I_use_my_existing_Windows_Server_license_with_EC2  Regards,  Tonderai."
59596,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi.  Thanks for the response. That covers off the windows license. More specifically I'm interested in the SQL license. AWS offers EC2 AMI's that include SQL Standard licensing in the hourly costs. If I import my own SQL Standard image from on-premise, can I pay for the SQL Standard licensing in the hourly costs in the same way as if I had used Amazon's SQL AMI?  Thanks"
59595,Amazon EC2 V0,"UDP/TCP Game server with close to 1000 concurrent players Hi AWS Friends!  Currently I'm running EC2 small instance to host a game server which has tonnes on UDP connections for syncing player positions, and not as much, but still substantial amount of TCP connections for syncing player actions(eg shooting, punching, etc, saving game data, etc).  I only have a max of 200 concurrent users right now.  But I do expect this to grow and would need to know what's the best EC2 setup to switch to when this happens.  I'm not looking for answers like hosting multiple servers where the client will pick(either manually or automatically), nor cluster solutions.  I just need to know if I had to stick with 1 server.  What type of server instance should I be upgrading to?    Thanks very much in advance!"
59595,Amazon EC2 V0,Did you ever figure this out?  I'm building an asynchronous game and would expect to have high traffic once it goes live...
59595,Amazon EC2 V0,"We've got an Architecture Whitepaper that addresses some of our recommendations for online gaming.    For your specific concerns about networking, you'll want to look into instances that support Enhanced Networking. This will give you the highest packets per second and the lowest latency.  Look for the Enhanced Networking section of our FAQ."
59595,Amazon EC2 V0,"thanks for the reply... that white paper is great... probably delivering more than I'll need for the time being but I'll certainly read up more on it..  At the moment I'm thinking.  Use Load balancing, with autoscale of my working instance... but I'll need to move mySQL database out of the instance so the autoscaled instances will all be looking at the same database. Whether that's on another instance or I can get my head around DynamoDB remains to be seen.  Thanks again.  Jon"
59595,Amazon EC2 V0,"If you don't want to wrap your head around DynamoDB yet, you might consider our RDS product that would let you keep using MySQL.  It is sometimes cheaper to use smaller instances + RDS, than to run your own databases on your own larger instances, plus you get all the scalability and safety features that we built in.  You don't need to run your own master/slave setup and handle backups.   You can try out some numbers on the Simple Monthly Calculator."

59593,Amazon EC2 V0,"Health check will only work if I use session stickyness with JSESSIONID HI all,  I'm new to ELB / AWS and I am a bit confused by something I've noticed.  I've configured 2 Elastic Load Balancers, a public facing one and an internal one.  I've observed the same issue on both, to say:  I configure the corresponding health check URL, point it at a JSP file that I request to my EC2 instance's Apache Web Server (port 80) which then fwds (AJP) onto the corresponding Tomcat server running on the same EC2 instance.  Health check fails UNLESS I enable session stickyness via JSESSIONID cookie. As soon as I enabled that, health check passes and things start working ""properly"". If I don't, request never reaches the aforementioned Apache Web Server (I monitored the access log)  Note that there is a single Tomcat instance behind that Apache Web Server.  Why on earth would session stickyness be required for that URL working properly?  Note that the URL works just fine if I request it from within the EC2 instance itself to the Apache Web Server it runs (i.e. without going through any LB)  Can someone shed some light on this?

59589,Amazon EC2 V0,"When you are asked about subnets, choose the public subnet(s) corresponding to the availability zone(s) where you want to place the ELB. You can then add instances from any subnet in the same availability zone(s). The ELB needs to be in a public subnet in order for it to be reachable from the Internet. It can however talk to instances placed in private subnets. But don't select the private subnets as that will break things."

59582,Amazon EC2 V0,"Planning Async Server Scalability?,  MySQL and PHP files, Auto Scale? Good afternoon.  I'm hoping someone can tell me if we're going in the right direction or way way way off.  I'm setting up a asynchronous game server on EC2 for an upcoming game launch.   • I've got an 8gb, t1.micro instance running Ubuntu, with MySQL and PHP installed.  This works well, and our test game can write to and read from the database. So the core access is running fine. Plus the game works well with our local test server.  Obviously we're hoping this becomes a great success and so want to plan for scalability.  I'm aware that once the game goes live we could be expecting many 1000's, 10'000's, hell millions of calls to the database and PHP scripts and would soon require something bigger.  I believe if I stop the instance, I can change its type to something bigger (and more expensive.. i.e. m1.medium). then start it again. Obviously I'd like to avoid doing that when the game is live so players don't have any connection problems. So would do it at quietest part of the day and before we go live.  Can we make use of AutoScaling… I've read the info on auto scaling and it all sounds very positive. Would it just work (once we've setup the criteria for scaling). I'm concerned as our game calls to an address where our current 8gb instance and database are. Would it be making use of the autoscaled additional servers without any clever coding?  Also (and this is where my server and computer chip ignorance shines through), if we have multiple users calling a PHP file  on our EC2 instance (which in turn lets them retrieve the latest game info). Would multiple copies of the script be run at the same time, or would they be queued, or just cause errors?…   I'm a professional animator by day, an indie game designer by night (5 years now) and now trying to understand the Server Side of gaming... my wife and kids definitely know I'm a geek... a cool game making geek.

This is a Windows Server 2012 AMI. I used the equivalent AMI (ami-752031c) and followed the steps as above. The instance boots with the volume, but is behaving badly.

59575,Amazon EC2 V0,"Placement Group questions We currently autoscale a bunch of web servers. The c3 instances are a much better deal, and the ability to run them inside of a placement group is appealing. However, before making the jump into using placement groups, I have a few questions:  1. Is there a maximum number of nodes in a placement group? Does that change with the instance types used?  2. If the placement group is ""full"" when an autoscale scale up event occurs, can/is the instance still created but outside of the placement group?  3. What is the chance of a placement group being full on a day to day basis? On a month to month basis? Our traffic is lower on weekends, growing week by week, and we're also adding many new services in our infrastructure over the next few months, and having them all in the same placement group would be nice.  4. Can members of a placement group be in different VPCs?  Thanks!"
59575,Amazon EC2 V0,Does anyone have any insight into any of these questions?  Thanks!
59575,Amazon EC2 V0,"Are you expecting a lot of traffic between instances inside the placement group? You mentioned web servers, but as this is all about internal connectivity I guess there must be other types of servers as well.

59575,Amazon EC2 V0,"Yes, I am expecting a lot of traffic, especially between web servers (will be c3 family) and cassandra (will be i2 family).  It's unlikely I'll saturate the network connection on the web machines, but it's very likely network will be the first bottleneck on the cassandra/i2 instances. Using a placement group would let us get more from the cassandra/i2 instances before scaling horizontally to get more bandwidth."
59575,Amazon EC2 V0,That makes sense. An AWS representative will hopefully stop by to address your specific questions.
59575,Amazon EC2 V0,"We're going live with stuff tomorrow. Any insight, Amazon?"
59575,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  Sorry about the late reply, To answer your questions,  1) There is no limitation of no of instances per placement group, however, you can not exceed your EC2 instance limit allocated to your account per region. This document also mentions a few limitations of placement groups that you may want to take note of.  http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html#concepts-placement-groups  2) Again, Auto scaling should not have any placement group specific limitations, unless it's limited by the account instance limits. And as mentioned in the document, placement groups are single AZ only. Although it's rare, if a particular instance type mentioned in the auto scaling launch configuration is not available in that specific AZ, you might run in to insufficient capacity errors.   3) This depends on how much scaling up and down happens on a daily basis. And that will be based on the conditions you would define for your auto scaling. You might want to monitor this during your application testing and let us know if you need an increase on the EC2 instance limit for that region.  4) Yes, I tested this one and the instances can span across VPCs, but they have to be on the same availability zone.  Hope this helps and let us know if you need any further information.  Thank you."

59568,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi myawsdude,  I have spoken to our security team and confirmed the following sections from the AWS Risk and Compliance Whitepaper (http://media.amazonwebservices.com/AWS_Risk_and_Compliance_Whitepaper.pdf) relate to this requirement:   “AWS customers retain control and ownership of their data.” (p15 ref17).   “AWS customers designate in which physical region their data and their servers will be located. Data replication for S3 data objects is done within the regional cluster in which the data is stored and is not replicated to other data center clusters in other regions. AWS customers designate in which physical region their data and their servers will be located. AWS will not move customers' content from the selected Regions without notifying the customer, unless required to comply with the law or requests of governmental entities. As of this writing, there are nine regions: US East (Northern Virginia), US West (Oregon), US West (Northern California), AWS GovCloud (US) (Oregon), EU (Ireland), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Sydney), and South America (Sao Paulo).” (p12 ref7)  If you have further questions with regard to this requirement, I encourage you to contact our Sales and Business Development team via the following form: http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/contact-us/  Regards,  Alastair"

An additional example, no billing or client data can be sent from Australia to the USA  Given the answer I will assume AWS are currently and will be still be non-complaint on the 12 of march.."

Regards, Joe"
59568,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  The following has come from our Legal team in response to the questions in this thread:  Data protection and providing a secure service are important to AWS as well as our customers.  We understand it is important for our customers to be able to meet their obligations under the Australian Privacy Principles.   The following responds to queries AWS has received about Australian Privacy Principle (APP) 8 dealing with cross-border disclosure of personal information.  The APPs take effect on 12 March 2014 along with other changes to Australia's privacy laws.     A customer using the AWS service maintains and does not release effective control over customer content.  The customer manages their content, including where it is stored, how it is stored, what encryption and other security tools are used and who has access to the customer content.  AWS acts as a passive host and does not control or access customer content.  In fact, AWS would not even know that a customer has chosen to upload personal information.  Current guidance from the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC), suggests that APP 8 may not apply to the AWS service.  APP 8 only applies if there is a relevant ""disclosure"".  The OAIC has said disclosure generally occurs when an entity releases personal information from its effective control.  The AWS service is structured so that a customer maintains and does not release customer content from the customer's effective control.  AWS is always monitoring information security, privacy and compliance requirements.   The APP Guidelines released by the OAIC are currently in draft format, and we will carefully consider any relevant updates and developments."

What we see happening is the following :  Ephemeral Drive not being create : the image ami-0a96ec63 includes an ephemeral drive mounted on E:. the drive very often doesn’t get create once we instantiate a Large machine, and more rarely once we create a medium machine.  Instance CPU Speed  inconsistent: the instances create do have different performances, for instance looking at the windows configuration we discover the following :    Case 1    Manufacturer:GenuineIntel    MaxClockSpeed:1876    Name:Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2650 0 @ 2.00GHz     Case 2    Manufacturer:GenuineIntel    MaxClockSpeed:2880    Name:Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU           E5430  @ 2.66GHz     Case 3    Manufacturer:GenuineIntel    MaxClockSpeed:2141    Name:Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU  E5645  @ 2.40GHz  Please notice again that the machine are both medium and generate from the same image.

The host machine share an ephemeral drive folder with the second machine, which accesses it using the internal IP address.  What we experienced is that we saw performances of 350 ms to create a 1.5 Mb file, and in other instances performances of 850 msec to perform the same operation.

59565,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  I wanted to take some time to try and address your issues.  1) Can you provide us with more information to look into this? What instance types are you trying to launch specifically?   2) Can you please tell me what Instance type you are using the launch these? You said they are medium, but more specificaly what size in medium? You can check the chart on this documentation: http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/   Because our system is so large and distributed, there is a chance you will get hardware that may be slightly different for the same instance type. For the m1 instance type the system gives a processor from the Intel Xeon Family.  3) for this we will also need more information. Are these the same sized instance? Also, are these instances in a VPC in the same subnet? Having these instance in the same VPC will help reduce network latency. Again, our system is using a shared service and can not guarantee network performance, you should build tolerance in your application to account for these fluctuations in network speed.  I hope this helps,  -AdamC"
59565,Amazon EC2 V0,"Thank you Adam for looking in to this, here is the information your request :  1 - I made another posting regarding this because it is now a major problem for us.

In some case we specify the zone (a, b, c, d). Should I just assume that the m1.medium instances will have a different hardware ? the reason I'm asking is that we do benchmark the system. If the underline hardware changes, I have to take in to account for it.  3 - They are all same size instances (m1.medium) in the same zone. We don't use VPC.

That is not a normal start-up file. A snapshot of the volume, would copy any nefarious files over to the new instance as well.   You could get access to your instance by mounting the root partition of this drive to another instance in the same availability zone and checking what is keeping the instance from booting.   It might be easier and safer to simply start a replacement instance and configure it to take the place of the original one. If you create the new instance in the same availability zone, you could mount the old root volume as an additional volume and copy data over. But I would recommend being very careful and treat any files on the original host as a potential threat.   Thank you,  Chris"

I had a look at your ELB and digging through the CloudWatch graphs for your ELB I can see that it has returned around 20 HTTP 400 errors and at the same time you also see almost same number of HTTP400 errors from the backend instance.  Please see CloudWatch for HTTPCode_ELB_4XX and HTTPCode_Backend_4XX metrics on your ELB. ( for security and privacy reasons I am unable to provide you with the direct links here. )   Usually HTTP 400 means BAD_REQUEST from the client  http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/ts-elb-error-message.html  ELB does pass through the client request to the backend instances with some minimal additions like x-forwarded-for header which in fact can be useful in troubleshooting this issue.   I also ran a curl against it and can see that you are running Nginx and we get HTTP 200 messages now. We also checked ELB event logs around the times that you mentioned and apart from registering and removing one backend instance I could not see any other issues.  What I recommend is to enable X-Forwarded-For header in your application server so you can find where these requests are coming from.  With that information then you can look at the actual requests and see if they are actually empty requests.  http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/TerminologyandKeyConcepts.html#x-forwarded-headers  Here is a guide on how to achieve that on Apache: http://www.techstacks.com/howto/log-client-ip-and-xforwardedfor-ip-in-apache.html  Please also make sure that Nginx does pass the header to your application server: https://rtcamp.com/tutorials/nginx/amazon-elastic-load-balancer-forward-real-ip/  Also please make sure that your backend instance is only open to the ELB, for more information on locking down your backend instances only to ELB please see following: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-elb-security-groups.html  Please let me know if you need any assistance with enabling X-Forwarded-For header or if you have any questions about above points.

59555,Amazon EC2 V0,"There is reality an issue, and due to which we are facing problems. Please try to resolve it."
59555,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  In order for us to investigate your issue further, can you please provide us with more information on the following:  1.) Latency on the ELB is high - does your backend instances connect to a database, a caching server or another external server.. i.e. does it have any external dependencies?   2.) Does your health check URL do anything apart from returning a simple static HTML page with text?  3.) What is the idle timeout set to on your backends? The ELBs default idle timeout is 60 seconds so you should ensure your backend matches or exceeds this to avoid blank pages.   The 400 errors you are observing fit perfectly with the secondary health check. From the following page: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/ts-elb-healthcheck.html  ""In addition to the health check you configure for your load balancer, a second health check is performed by the service to protect against potential side-effects caused by instances being terminated without being deregistered. To perform this check, the load balancer opens a TCP connection on the same port that the health check is configured to use, and then closes the connection after the health check is completed, which will usually result in a 408 error response.""  Once you have give us the requested information, we can confirm if that's the case or not."
59555,Amazon EC2 V0,"Thanks for your response. The required information is as :   1. My instance have the external dependencies of database server.  2. No, my health check URL is a simple html response specially for the ELB response, no other request is performed by it.   3. Ya my request time out is set to 60s."

59554,Amazon EC2 V0,unexpected reboots why is our ec-2 instance is rebooting without reason - i can't find anything in log files?  instance i-29a04858  two last reboot times: 2014.02.08 17:40 UTC 2014.02.10 11:42 UTC ( 20 minutes ago )
59554,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  Unfortunately our system is unable to see when your instance reboots. This is done at the OS level once the virtual instance is created. You may be able to find more information in /var/log/last   This could help point you in the right direction.  You can also view the console output directly for that instance from the EC2 Console. You may also want to look at any crash dumps.   Do you know if the instance is just rebooting? or crashing and rebooting?   Thanks,  -AdamC"
59554,Amazon EC2 V0,nothing is showing up in logfiles. just boot up strings. instance becomes unavailable for some minutes and when i can finally connect to it - uptime is 0 min - os is freshly started
59554,Amazon EC2 V0,Hello  I've taken a look at your instance and can see it restarted due to the underlying hardware becoming degraded at around the times you mentioned.  I'd recommend that you look to issue a stop / start to move away to new underlying hardware.  Rgds AndyC

59551,Amazon EC2 V0,"Spot instance pricing broken! Prices are $0.0001 above API pricing From about 11am AEST today the spot prices for most instance types in Sydney went up by $0.0001 but due to rounding or some other reason, the API used to fetch spot pricing is not returning this amount accurately, it is short by $0.0001  This is evidenced by the spot pricing history graphs which also show the price for node type m1.xlarge is $0.0800 on Linux.  This means I can't bid the spot price and get instances, I continually get:   Spot request sir-a84af059 is in state open with status [price-too-low: Your Spot request price of 0.08 is lower than the minimum required Spot request fulfillment price of 0.0801  An m1.xlarge currently returns a spot bid price of 0.080000 using the API call DescribeSpotPriceHistoryRequest as well.  This has completely broken our spot implementation where we closely follow the spot price for batch processing.

59549,Amazon EC2 V0,"Issues with Outbound Connections Nevermind... Wrong Subnet   Edited by: dununubatman on Feb 10, 2014 10:46 PM"
59548,Amazon EC2 V0,"Instance won't stop neihter terminate Hello,  I restarted my instance  from the OS but it never got back online so I logged to aws.com to reboot the instance, that didn't work either so I tried to stop it and start it again and that didn't work too.  I terminated the instace and kept the EBS volume in order not to lose data, but the instance is shutting down for hours now and the volume won't de attach.  Please help.  Thanks,"

59546,Amazon EC2 V0,"Inaccessable instance after IP change. Hey everyone  I was playing around and somehow I appear to have done something weird when setting a static private IP address and I have lost communications with my instance.  This instance is on a sub-net that is only accessible over a VPN connection and does not have a public IP.  The instance ID is i-2405141b  Now normally I would run to the console session and fix it.  That's a tad hard when it's in the cloud   Does anyone have any suggestions as to get myself out of the ditch please?    It is possible to just delete the virtual network connection from the web console and have it added again thus hopefully getting a new IP via DHCP when it reboots?  However I can't seem to find any buttons that will let me do that or am I heading down the wrong path?  As an aside while I wallow in my stupidity, from what I can read on the web it would appear that a particular instance always gets the same private IP address or how should I handle this?  I can't seem to find anything that points me in the right direction or is a definitive guide on what to do when you want to be sure that you always get the same private IP for that instance.  Thanks.  Murray"
59546,Amazon EC2 V0,Ahha!  After much stuffing around I finally found the right buttons.  For those that do what I did you can fix it by:  Creating a new network interface Assign it to your instance wait a few mins Connect to your instance and fix your stuffup.

59539,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  I was also able to confirm that I could access your instance over port 3389. You may want to check any third party software you may be using that could potentially block your access. Also, are you connecting to a VPN back to something like your office, where the traffic could be routed?   http://winmtr.net/ is a popular trace-route tool, You could also just try the basic windows command  tracert to find the path. It will still go over ICMP but hopefully we can see the path it takes to try and get there.  Also, to answer your networking question, The broadcast address is just reserved as the address with all 1's in a Base 2 system with in a Subnet. So if your IP range was 192.168.100.1/24 your broadcast address would be 192.168.100.255 because it would be the address with every bit filled for that range.    If the subnet was something like 192.0.0.0/8 then 192.255.255.255 would be the broadcast address, but 192.168.100.255 is still a usable address.    I hope this helps,   -AdamC"

59538,Amazon EC2 V0,"""py-list"" or ""py-bt"" not working on gdb with python in Amazon Linux AMI Hi, All  It has been a long time for me to meet this problem. I have used the x86_64 Amazon Linux AMI to launch my instances.  And I do the following actions to enable gdb on python:  First, Install the python debuginfo package for Python26 or Python27     yum install -y gdb python26-debuginfo     yum install -y gdb python27-debuginfo  Second, use python or python27 to run a simple python server to test     python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080 &     python27 -m SimpleHTTPServer 9090 &  Third, use gdb to attach on these processes:    gdb python <process of python26>    gdb python27 <process of python27>  Use the commands ""py-bt"" or ""py-list"", then it pop out the error message like this:     (gdb) py-list     Unable to read information on python frame  Therefore, for both python26 and python27, gdb usage on python code seems not working  Could you please help me on this issue? It is really important when we found the code hung in the system and need the python code location for further investigation.  Thanks Henry"
59538,Amazon EC2 V0,I also tested on the latest Amazon Linux AMI i686  It works well. So maybe this issue happens only in 64bit python.  Wish this information would help.
59538,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi,  First make sure you have the latest updates or there will be version issues with debuginfo packages: sudo yum update   To install debuginfo packages, you need to enable the debuginfo repository (disabled by default). You can do that like this: sudo yum --disablerepo='*' --enablerepo='*-debug*' install python26-debuginfo   You're also going to need a bunch of other debuginfo packages to get gdb to a mostly working state: sudo yum --disablerepo='*' --enablerepo='*-debug*' install \   e2fsprogs-debuginfo \   glibc-debuginfo \   glibc-debuginfo \   keyutils-debuginfo \   krb5-debuginfo \   libffi-debuginfo \   libselinux-debuginfo \   ncurses-debuginfo \   nss-debuginfo \   openssl-debuginfo \   readline-debuginfo \   zlib-debuginfo   Once I do these things, py-bt works for me in gdb.  We've been playing with py-list for a while and haven't gotten it to work yet. We've even tried updating to the RHEL7 version without success. Even so, you should be able to do most debugging by using regular gdb commands plus py-bt, py-up, and py-down.  Let us know if that works for you, or if there's something else we can do to help.  Thanks for using the Amazon Linux AMI!"
59538,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi Henry,  I just wanted to let you know that we're working on improving Python (specifically Python 2.7) integration with gdb. Thanks for pointing out the rough spots!  For now you should be able to debug Python code with pdb and C modules with normal gdb + py-bt.  As always, let us know if you run into issues!"
59538,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi, Ethan  Thanks for your kind help. I have done further investigation and tests on this issue based on CentOS 6.x. Amazon Linux AMI also based on that platform. So it might be similar.  Investigation I have done more testing on how to debug python via GDB based on official python package. Test Case: py-list can show the source code in running  The result is that Platform         |  i686         | x86_64 CentOS 6.0    |	 PASS	 |  FAIL CentOS 6.2    |	 PASS	 |  FAIL CentOS 6.5    |  PASS	 |  FAIL RHEL 7 Beta   |  PASS	 |  PASS  Root Cause It is caused by the compiler: GCC on x86_64 platform,  CentOS 6.0, 6.2, 6.5 all used the GCC v4.4.x, but RHEL 7 Beta took the GCC v4.8.x  This bug has been opened in https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=556975 for a long time.  Each new GCC version caused different issues on Python Debugging. But for the issue here it seems resolved in the new version of GCC.  Verification <STEPS> 1.	Install new GCC x86_64 on CentOS 6.x 2.	Make a new Python package compiled from this new GCC 3.	Use the test case above to verify “py-list”  I adopted the toolchain named devtoolset v1.1, which is provided by Redhat for developers to use new GCC on the old base system. This tool makes the installation of new GCC and switch new from old version of GCC more easily.   scl enable devtoolset-1.1 bash Now we have new GCC version.  Here is the result: On the base system: CentOS 6.x (x86_64)   * Python 2.7.5 with GCC v4.7.2: Passed  * Python 2.7.5 with GCC 4.8.1: Passed  Possible Solutions  [1] Upgrade to CentOS 7 (will be released in this year)  Benefits:    * It is totally based on Fedora 19 (which takes Python 2.7.5 as the base, which means we do not need to manage the customized Python package any more.)    * It will finally be migrated to this version in the future  [2] Extra-Install new GCC via devtoolset  on the current system (CentOS 6.x) and package a new Python  Benefits:     * No need to change the base system (kept on CentOS 6.x)     * Python 2.7.x will use the new GCC but other component would keep using the GCC in base system  If you have any comments, feel free to contact me via twitter @henrysher  Best wishes, Henry"

We are trying to create a cluster of Windows 2008 machines to host and run an engineering modeling application accross as many cores and we can feed it. We don't need Windows Clustering, but we do need all the networking bandwidth we can get.  The networking should be fairly simple, just a workgroup with a shared folder.   I created a primary VM, based on an AWS AMI for Windows 2008 R2 Server. Created a security group allowing access by anyone (for testing purposes), and sharing group. We were successfully able to share a folder accross a couple machines in a workgroup with normal networking.   I did this because all literature said that to enable 10gb network interfacing, we need to enable ""Enhanced netoworking"" and that only worked in 2008R2. (We need to use 2008 by limitation of the program we are working in).   After installing the Intel driver as per documentation, and enabling the SRIOV flag via CLI, invariably we can no longer connect to the machine.   Tried to create it from scratch and repeat the process step for step, same thing occurred.   Has anyone encounterred this? Is the SRIOV necessary for using the 10gb connection?

59527,Amazon EC2 V0,"IOPS - Monthly Calcs vs Billing Hi there,  Can anyone explain exactly how the IOPS billing is calculated, particularly the ""per IOPS-month provisioned"" and ""per GB-month of PIOPS provisioned storage"" as these make up the bulk of our incurred charges.  Usage listed in these billing items obviously determines the overall cost, but how is the usage actually calculated and racked up?  Is it based on what's provisioned - for example, if you setup several volumes totalling 2,000Gb size with 8500 IOPS provisioned, you're charged for 2,000Gb and 8500Gb IOPS for just using these at any point?  Or is it usage based, so you provisioned size/IOPS as above but for example only use 1,500Gb of the space and instance IOPS peaks out at 6500 - you don't get charged for the full provisioned amount?  Also - do offline instances with provisioned IOPS volumes add to the usage at all? Or standard EBS volumes in any way?  Would appreciated some clarity on this if possible as I'm struggling to marry up our current billing with what we've provisioned/are using and or the estimates given by the monthly cost calculator?  I can provide details on our instance/volume setup, estimate from the monthly cost calculator and current billing totals for these items if required?  Thanks"
59527,Amazon EC2 V0,"An IOPS-month or GB-month is a single unit provisioned for one month. If you set up a volume with 1 IOPS and 1 GB (not possible, so just an example) at the start of the month and keep it right until that month ends, you will be charged for 1 IOPS-month and 1 GB-month. Deleting the volume in the middle of the month would mean that you have used only half and is billed accordingly. The actual volume of I/O operations or stored data doesn't matter. You will be charged for what you have provisioned. The state of an EC2 instance doesn't affect EBS billing. Standard EBS volumes are priced differently and you can expect to see separate line items for that usage. Standard EBS storage is billed based on what you provision, but I/O charges for a standard volume will be based on what you actually consume."

59514,Amazon EC2 V0,Is 10 gbps out to internet possible? Cluster Placement Group allows instances to communicate between each other over 10 gbps ethernet. Is 10 gbps out to internet possible with Cluster Placement Group or some other combination of EC2 instance types or even one single high capacity instance?
59514,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  Could you please explain your use case? What exactly are you hoping to do?  Richard"
59514,Amazon EC2 V0,"Video streaming out from EC2 directly. Our use case involves part streaming through CloudFront part through our own streaming server. Bandwidth out to internet on our EC2 instance can go beyond 1 gbps too, hence we wanted to check if there is some EC2 setup which offers multi gbps bandwidth out to internet."
59514,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi,  A single instance will not provide that speed but if its fronted by Cloudfront you wont have a problem achieving higher speeds.  You could use an instance type which very high I/O but it is still not going to give you 10GBps.  I hope this helps."

End game is to install Skype on EC2 Windows Server 2012 instance.  I have the Windows Audio service started and can play audio from EC2 to client over RDP without any problems.  RDC client is configured to allow remote audio recording and this works against a test Windows 7 host.  EC2 server group policy has been set to ""Allow audio recording redirection"".  However, no ""Remote Audio"" devices show up on the EC2 instance.  Note that I do not have the ""Remote Desktop Services"" role installed due to incompatibility with Microsoft Office 365.  Consequently, I can only access the server via RDC in administrative mode."
59497,Amazon EC2 V0,"Appears as if this is indeed another case where Remote Desktop Services role must be installed to achieve full RDP functionality !!!  After installing RDS role, the Remote Audio device was present (even if licensing etc wasn't configured yet).  Looks as if Remote Desktop in administrative mode only supports audio for sound playback.  This appears similar to printer redirection where EasyPrint will only be used if RDS role is installed.  Note that enabling ""Allow audio recording redirection"" wasn't necessary as this is the default on Windows Server 2012.  Unfortunately, I cannot install RDS role as Microsoft Office 365 won't run if it thinks the host is running terminal services.  Does anyone know of other software that can redirect audio from client to EC2 server?  Ideally this would be over the RDP connection similar to what TSPrint does for remote printing (which is how I worked around my issue with requiring RDS role for EasyPrint support)."
59496,Amazon EC2 V0,"Slow upload to EU West We have experienced upload problems on our EC2 instances for over two weeks and today we investigated with the help of iperf (tcp/ip benchmarking tool).  Download speeds from EU West to anywhere is great and not a problem, Upload however is maxed out at 400-500kbps per tcp/ip connection. Running 10 simultaneous tcp/ip threads yields 400-500kbps per thread yielding a total of 4-5Mbps so the problem seams to be not the bandwidth per say but the per tcp/ip session bandwidth.  We have tested the download speed from both servers located in Sweden and the UK (London) with the exact same results so it looks to be an Amazon related problem.  We have also tested EC2 instance to EC2 instance inside EU West and there is no problems, even between zones the up- and download speed is great.

59494,Amazon EC2 V0,"How to setup IAM role or group for permission to start/stop one instance? Hi,  I like to have a specific permission set to enable start or stop a specific EC2 instance only, or a group of instances.  The instance is a CI system or a slave build server that should be started at planned time, but only when my code changes. Thus I like to trigger weekly builds, when changes are detected by my local system (by monitoring CVS).  The IAM template for full access to EC2 is too much and there must be a more fine granular setup.  My planned instances would be a Windows Server to build code by Jenkins and a second one on Linux doing the same for that platform. A third and fourth would be started on successful build to start testing on these for CD purposes (Continuous Delivery).  So my local CVS monitoring system needs to start the CI systems and the CI systems needs to start their CD systems that match the OS system.  I like to do this due to cost savings, because I do not work all the time on the code that modifies the contents on CVS.  How would roles or groups look like for this scenario?  Thanks, Lothar"
59494,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello Lothar,  Thank you for writing into the AWS Forums.  Our IAM policies documentation provides many examples which could help to illustrate how you would set up an IAM role or group:  http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-policies-for-amazon-ec2.html  Specifically, example 3 shows how to limit access to only a set of instances:  http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-policies-for-amazon-ec2.html#ex3  Regards,  Troy W"
59494,Amazon EC2 V0,"Thanks,  I have followed the samples and created a group for each action to start or stop the CI server and the CD server. Each role got a member like myciuser and mycduser. The groups have a policy to perform the action to start one instance I have setup.  StartCIGroup   Start my instance policy for my CI instance   (I have seen samples to list up resources, but I tend to use one policy per instance)  StopCIGroup   Stop my instance policy for my CI instance  StartCDGroup   Start my instance policy for my CD instance  StopCDGroup   Stop my instance policy for my CD instance  That way I am able to easily add more policies or drop them per instance.   Also I can control, that my local machine is only able to start the CI instance. The CI instance should start the CD instance and stop itself. The CD instance should also be able to stop itself.  Now I am reading the Roles documentation and I am unsure how I have to setup a role to be used in my local Open SuSE server at home. I do not have an AD (or the Samba version).  I also do not know, how to setup firewall rules to enable federation using AD.  What is the most simple role setup to be used with the CLI tools?  I like to not use facebook or google, so the option would be an IAM user, but then I question myself, why do I need the role?  Lothar"

59484,Amazon EC2 V0,"How can I change my instance type from a c1.medium to a c3.xlarge? Within the AWS console, when I select Actions > Instance Management > Change Instance Type the only options I see are these: t1.micro, m1.small, m1.medium, and c1.medium. Am I missing something, or is there another way to accomplish such a conversion?  I need to stay in the Compute Optimized family of instances, but I need more RAM than the 1.7 GB offered with c1.medium. The limited storage (80 GB) of the new c3.xlarge instance is sufficient for my needs and the rate of $0.466/hour (Windows) is much more palatable than the $0.900/hour (Windows) of the previous generation next step-up c1.xlarge.

59484,Amazon EC2 V0,"Thank you for your reply. I did as you suggested. However, I forgot to mention that in this process I also want to upgrade my OS to WinSer 2008 R2 SP1 (64-bit) from WinSer 2008 SP2 (32-bit).   In my attempt to accomplish, I have created a new instance (c3.xlarge) in a different Availability zone (us-east-1c) using the following public AMI: ami-e55a7e8c. I then created a Snapshot of my existing EBS Volume in Availability zone us-east 1d. Then I created a new EBS Volume in Availability zone us-east 1c using the Snapshot from my existing EBS Volume and attached this new volume to my new instance.

59484,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi David,  Ah, I'm afraid there is a problem here. There is no upgrade path for a 32-bit instance that will allow it to run on a 64-bit VM. That's actually why the c3 type wasn't available to you in the first place - my apologies for us not flagging that sooner - as 32-bit instances will only run on those four types.

I can see that you have launched the instance from an AWS AMI template so there should be no other configuration issues inside of the instance.  I have noticed that this instance is a t1.micro, which has CPU and memory restrictions. On occasion I've found this to be an issue with Windows instances and they may sometimes hang on booting.  What I would suggest as a quick remedy - You could try to Stop and Start this instance back up again to see if that helps? Failing that, could you launch a new instance from the same AMI template, however choose the next size up instance (m1.small) and this should get you up and running.

59478,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi PhilP,  The machine that does work:  ec2-version: 1.6.12.2 2013-10-15 OS: Ubuntu 13.10 ( x86_64 )  The machine that does not work:  ec2-version: 1.6.12.2 2013-10-15 OS: Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS ( x86_64 )  I'm pretty sure I installed these tools from the exact same tarball.

59478,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi Stephen,  The only other suggestions I could make at this stage are as follows:  It would be worth checking to see if there is anything different with the internet connectivity or connection path between the computer that works and computer that doesn't work. Does one go through some form of proxy where the other doesn't? Are they both connected to the same physical network? Does one have a virus scanner or firewall where the other doesn't?  The other thing worth checking - I see that you are using the ""raw"" option to send the contents of an actual volume up to S3. Are there any differences here between the 2 machines? What about permissions?  Failing that, we can run it past the VM Import experts here to see if they are able to make any other suggestions for you. Let us know how you go.  Best regards, Phil P"

59476,Amazon EC2 V0,"Mounting Eligible Volumes Hi all,  For several months, I have been using EC-2 on a micro instance and have recently transitioned to a General Purpose m3.xlarge. When launching the m3.xlarge, I opted to use my existing AMI which I created from my original micro instance. Is it possible to use one of the SSDs as a root mount point?  Thank you!  Edited by: abheji on Feb 7, 2014 5:40 PM"
59476,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi there abheji,  It is possible to use the Instance Storage volumes as the root drive, however there is no direct way to convert your existing EBS Root volume backed instance to an Instance Store backed Instance.  More information around the Instance Storage volumes and the various use cases for using these volumes can be found here: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html  In order to convert your EBS backed instance into an Instance Store backed instance, the rough steps would be (assumes that an up-to-date AMI has been captured first):  1) Launch an instance-store instance from an AMI that uses the same kernel used by your current EBS-backed AMI.  2) Create an EBS volume from the snapshot underlying the EBS AMI. (Alternatively, launch an instance of the EBS AMI and Stop the instance when it begins booting. Detach the root volume from the instance - this is usually the volume attached to /dev/sda1.)  3) Attach the EBS volume to the instance-store instance (to a secondary mount point).  4) rsync the contents of the EBS volume to the root volume.  5) Create an instance-store AMI using the standard methods (more below).  6) Detach the EBS volume and delete it. If you launched an EBS instance in step 2, terminate it.  The instructions for creating an Instance Store based AMI can be found here: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/creating-an-ami-instance-store.html  I hope this information helps to point you in the right direction here.

59473,Amazon EC2 V0,"Current version for Citrix PV driver I see the link to update the PV driver and understand the need to update the EC2 ConfigService first.    My question is what version of the PV driver is contained in the current up script zip file?  It appears that our current Citrix PV Ethernet Adapter Driver Version is 5.9.960.49119.  All of our EC2 instances (win 2008 & 2012) produce an event 5001 Xennet6 error in the system log.  While we don't appear to have any other issues the error is produced on every startup.  It is then reported back to our management agents.  I would like to eliminate this error.  Will an update tot he PV driver resolve the error or is there some other change required to resolve this error?  Thank you,  John"
59473,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  Thank You for creating this forum post. The current version of the PV driver that is contained in the current up script zip file is: 6.0.2.57617 http://aws.amazon.com/developertools/2187524384750206  The Windows event entries your experiencing are a know issue and are cosmectic in nature and do not affect the functionality of your instance.  The ""Event ID 5001 from source Xennet6 cannot be found"" notice is indicating that the PV drivers are looking for a feature that is not available from the underlying host""  You may disregard these errors. That being said, you can also upgrade the PV drivers: This upgrade installs a new paravirtualization driver that improves performance.   Thanks, Sneha"
59473,Amazon EC2 V0,"Thank you for your reply.  Better performance is always appreciated so we will update the driver soon.    My real ""concern"" is the error.  I understand it is only cosmetic and does not truly reflect any problems.  However, the servers hosted in this environment are frequently subject to third-party security audits.  This error continually prompts long discussions of he-said/she-said, if you understand my analogy.    bottom line is, I need to stop the error from being generated in the event log.    I need either 1) an official statement from Amazon explaining this error, it's cause and effect or 2) I need to stop this error from being generated.  I'm tired of fighting mind-numbing auditors that cannot accept a non-error error.  Please understand I'm between a rock and a hard place and need a real resolution to the problem.  Thank you,  John"

There is no way to ""disable"" the creation of events within the event log, this is why it's an effect audit and monitoring tool.  Good idea though.

As this is a fresh instance you are launching from an AMI, I would either suggest to go back to the original instance you took the AMI from (and make corrections prior to capturing a new AMI), or you could stop this EC2 instance and move the root volume to another instance as a secondary volume so that you can make the appropriate re-configuration changes to the NIC configuration before moving the volume back to the original instance.

59459,Amazon EC2 V0,Basic SQL server backup strategy to your S3 bucket using Cloudberry See attached PDF and feel free to comment or improve upon what I started today.
59459,Amazon EC2 V0,"That looks good; it's one approach and seems like it should work fine.  Godd documentation too!  We do it a little differently, and I'll share the basics quickly...  We backup on a very similar schedule, but the destination for the .BAK and .TRN files is a dedicated EBS volume attached so it appears as ""C:\SQL Server Backups"", and a subfolder exists for each database.  We have an hourly  ""Task Scheduler"" job that runs a simple C# program that creates an EC2 ""snapshot"" of the entire volume.  Basically, we can recreate our ""backups folder hierarchy"" as a new EBS volume at any time.  We could mount it on some other instance to perform restores, or whatever.  EC2 snapshots are stored at S3.  Just for redundancy, we also use a ""Task Scheduler"" job to run a little S3.exe command which copies that actual .BAK and .TRN files to a duplicate hierachy at S3; we essentially use S3.exe in the same way you use CloudBerry.  (S3.exe is free, and has a ""copy hierachy"" capability.  I use CloudBerry regularly for lots of ad-hoc interactive types of things, and I love it.)

59459,Amazon EC2 V0,Great to hear from you. Yes you are correct - there are many ways to skin this cat!  Here are some of the ways others can save money further:  Utilizing some type of compression with your sql backup whether using sql compression or a third party compression utility.  Opting for the reduced redundancy S3 storage rate
59459,Amazon EC2 V0,"Take a look at SQLBackupAndFTP - it already has compression and a very straightforward way to send backups to Amazon S3. The screenshot is attached, you can also see  this post on the subject"
59459,Amazon EC2 V0,"We use SQL Server TDE, (transparent data encryption), so ""at rest"" data is encrypted, and this includes backups.  Sadly, the encrypted data does not compress at all, really.  We use a little free tool called S3.exe, and it has a hierarchy xcopy-lie feature that will keep and S3 folder hierarchy synchronized with some filesystem hierarchy.  It' a great way to have SQL Server Agent age-out backup files from the filesystem, and have that also reflected at S3.  We simply run the S3.exe commands after completing successful SQL Server full/log backups.  James"

59456,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  Thank You for creating this forum post. I further checked your instance: i-cdf09de3 and I do see the volume you are referring to:  /dev/sdb -> ephemral 0  This is an instance store volume. An instance store provides temporary block-level storage for use with an instance. There are no additional charges for this. It comes with few instance types. You can deselect this during the launch of the instance.   The size of an instance store ranges from 150 GiB to up to 48 TiB, and varies by instance type. Instance store volumes are usable only from a single instance during its lifetime; they can't be detached.

59453,Amazon EC2 V0,"What could cause a sudden drop in requests going through my ELB? I have a site with an ELB sitting in front of 2 instances, in two different AZs within US-East-1.  I use Route53 DNS to point the apex of my domain to the ELB with an ALIAS record.  I do not have any DNS-level health checks or failovers.  Normally this site gets around 100 requests per second.  At around 4:45 am eastern time on Saturday, Feb 1, the site became unreachable, and was offline for about 3 minutes, according to Pingdom, and then was back to normal.  When I looked at the ELB monitoring tab, I could see that the requests dipped way down during that brief outage.  The logs on my instances did not indicate anything amiss, other than the drop in requests.  To me, this means that something went wrong either with the ELB, or with the DNS layer.  Otherwise, the ELB monitoring would not show a drop in the number of requests.  If both instances were down, the ELB would still receive the same number of requests, and just have to serve 503s or something similar, right?  Is there another possibility that I'm not considering, such that this wasn't an AWS problem?  How can I a) find out what went wrong and more importantly b) protect myself from this kind of outage?"
59453,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  Thank you for posting,  Can you please provide your ELB link so that we can investigate this further.  Regards,  Marcin"
59453,Amazon EC2 V0,"The DNS name of the load balancer is sm-2028510048.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com.  If that's not what you need, let me know where to find the right piece of information.  You asked for the ELB link but I'm not sure what that is or where to find it."
59453,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  It looks like your ELB scaled at the exact time of this event.  This would have resulted in a change of IP addresses. Your site would not actually have been down, but anyone attempting to access it would have needed to refresh their DNS in order to access the changed IP. Those using cached DNS might get the old address until their system updated.  The DNS TTL on ELBs is 60 seconds so the maximum impact due to a scaling event should be that at the very outside.  Richard"
59453,Amazon EC2 V0,"Thanks for the reply.  Where can I find more information on what happens when an ELB scales?  From the description in your answer, it seems that the old IP address does not work when a scaling event happens.  Wouldn't it make more sense to keep the old IP address active for at least a little while, given the distributed nature of DNS and how things don't propagate immediately?  I'm sure this issue has been considered carefully in the design of ELB, so I'm surprised this kind of thing would happen.  The vast majority of our traffic is clicks from web browsers, not machine traffic where DNS can often be cached for way too long.  Incidentally, we had another incident just like this one, on January 7th at around 8:40 am Eastern time.  Would it be possible to check if that was the same cause?  Are there any best practices for avoiding this kind of downtime, or is it just something I have to live with if I want to use ELB?"
59453,Amazon EC2 V0,"Probably this is bad forum behavior, but ... I'm hoping someone will respond to my follow-up questions above."
59453,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi,  When the ELB scales the old IP is still active for a period of time afterwards to mitigate the issue where clients may be going directly to the IP address or broken DNS etc.  Thanks"
59453,Amazon EC2 V0,"That is good to hear.  But I don't understand then, what could have caused our traffic to drop like that.  Assuming that all of our sources of traffic don't cache DNS for longer than the average traffic source would cache it, what could explain such a dramatic drop?  And how could I protect my site from having that happen in the future?"
59452,Amazon EC2 V0,"Very strange billing with EC2 reserved instances In my project I use a g2.2xlarge instance running 100% of time. So I decided to buy a reserved instance with Heavy utilization to save some money.  Yesterday I purchased the reserved instance and it became State=active. But since then it's Usage price equals $0.00 (which means I don't use it?) and total rate of money spending hugely increased!  As you can see on attached screenshot, I was charged about $100 for just last 4 hours! Why did this happen?  The reserved instance configuration and the configuration of instance I use are the same:   both g2.2xlarge both us-east-1b my instance is running Ubuntu server 12.04 LTS while reserved instance's platform is Linux/UNIX (correct?)   Please help me with this issue!"
59452,Amazon EC2 V0,"You can expect to see two line items for the reservation in the Billing Management Console. With a Heavy utilization reservation, you are always charged for the full number of hours each month, no matter if there is an instance running or not. This charge will show up in full on your bill more or less right away. So what you are seeing now should be the hourly charges for the reservation in February. Another line item, the $0 one, will show how many hours you have actually used. This is only for informational purposes as it doesn't affect what you are being charged. This line will always stay at $0, but you can expect the hours to increase, which tells you that the reservation is being used as expected."
59452,Amazon EC2 V0,"Thank you very much for this explanation, I now understand the reason of this charge. It is indeed approximately equal to the amount of money I should pay for hourly use of the reserved instance in the rest of February.  However I still don't quite get the ""Usage Price = $0.00"". Ok, this is for informational purposes, but my instance is running for at least several hours now, is it just updated slowly?  When can I expect something more than $0.00 in this column? I kinda need this to make sure that everything is correct"
59452,Amazon EC2 V0,"The $0 line item on your bill in the Billing Management Console will always remain zero, but the hours will change as you use the reservation. I'm not sure about the ""Usage Price"" displayed in EC2, though. Looks useful even for a Heavy utilization reservation.  Someone from AWS will hopefully spot this thread."
59452,Amazon EC2 V0,"I actually don't have access to the Billing Management Console right now (due to user rights restrictions), so I mean the ""Usage Price"" column from AWS Console -> EC2 -> Reserved Instances view.  Thank you for all help hopefully someone from Amazon can clarify this indeed."
59452,Amazon EC2 V0,"Heavy utililization reservations don't have a ""usage price"", because as stated earlier you are charged up front each month for 100% of the hourly charges for the reservation.  For heavy utilization reservations AWS doesn't actually care if you run an instance or not, they simply charge you for full usage.  It is up to you to ensure you provision enough resources to consume what you have already paid for.  You will notice on the Reserved Instances view a ""Recurring Charges"" column, which lists the hourly rate you are being charged up front for.  For other reservation types (light and medium), there is a usage price listed, because in these scenarios you are only charged the lower hourly rate for times when you do have an instance running.   Hopefully this makes sense."

Disable makewhatis.cron by default  This causes unnecessary CPU/IO load on fresh instances. Especially pronounced on t1.micro  2. PostgreSQL 9.3 Package  So, we can easily move back and forth between RDS and running our own cluster. Also, PostgreSQL 9.3 has some features that are very useful.  3. Chef Omnibus Package  Even though OpsWorks currently is at 11.4, I would prefer 11.6 or above as it has support for Chef Solo environments.

Elastic IP is assigned, instance is running, security groups are the same, but SSH connection fails permanently (like port is not listening, not a timeout). PING responds normally.  The reboot was made to kill mysqld (/etc/init.d/mysql stop writes that it stopped mysql server but it was still taking 300mb RAM according to TOP, kill command looks like work but didn't actually kill). I enabled swap, so there should not be any fail due to insufficient memory. I'm new in Amazon EC2 but I never saw such problems with ordinal VPS or Linux PC.  How to connect to my EC2 VPS? what should I check? (P.S. I don't want to create second instance to try to connect from second to first using internal IP)"

Now after reboot I can't access it via ssh (but only from my home/comcast) and I can't connect to my home (comcast) from the rebooted instance. I seem to be able to connect to from other locations ... so that's strange.  I was able to create another micro instance (let's call it B) and connect to to A via private-A from B.  I can connect from B to home (comcast) and from home to B. WTF ? Routing ? But where ? Certainly not on my end.  So I tried switching out the public IPs on A. Attached new Elastic IP to A. Nada. Same thing. Can't connect from home (but can connect from other places).   Tried setting up a new NIC and assigned it to A. Got that.  Console says there is eth0, eth1. When I go to A (via private-A from B) ifconfig says there is only 1  eth0 and lo. No eth1. I wanted to see if anther EIP via eth1 to A would work. No go.  Lost and frustrated because the things that supposed to work don't.  A does not eat CPU. It does I/O.  B is doing nothing now. Just a gateway to A.  Someone ? Anyone ?"

59437,Amazon EC2 V0,"Large file FTP fails...network timeout on micro instances? I'm running an Ubuntu 10.x micro instance. Have been running it for a few years, no issues. vsftp is installed and I can successfully ftp files to/from using both active and passive mode. In short, everything generally works fine.  What I notice is that when I ftp upload files larger than ~400MB to my instance, the network connection aborts, causing my ftp client to either error out (command line) or fail and restart the transmission from scratch (SmartFTP).  I read through all the vsftp config parameters and changes the two connection (idle and data) timeouts to be 8 hours, even though from the docs, these parameters didn't seem to apply because my connection wasn't idle or stalled. No change.  I wondered in my Windows XP based desktop sending the data was a problem, so I retried using a Windows Vista machine - again using 2 clients (command line and SmartFTP) - no change. So that's 2 different OS platforms across 4 different clients.  Thinking that I ruled out the desktop and my local connection, I ftp'd the file to a different server - one not hosted on AWS, unknown OS version and ftp server version and the transmission worked. So that pointed back at my AWS instance in some way...  Unbuntu seems to be configured properly...even vsftpd...so I wonder; does the AWS micro instance have some type of timeout/limit on how long a network connection can be active? Or perhaps a limit on the data that can be transferred on a given active connection?  Thanks..."

So we can investigate this for you further - Are you able to check / clarify:  Which InstanceID's were impacted with this issue You mention you were trying to ping other servers - Was connectivity (ping) the problem here, or was it a name resolution problem? For example could you ping the server via the IP address rather than the DNS name? Are you able to check which DNS Servers these instances have been configured to use - Are you running your own DNS server or are you using the AWS DNS servers? Check if this issue is a generic DNS failure (not able to resolve any DNS name) - Or was this an issue resolving a specific DNS name? Perhaps try to run an nslookup on google.com? Run a test to see if you are able to resolve the same DNS name through an alternate resolver (for example try the Google DNS resolvers at: 8.8.8.8)   Armed with the information above we can investigate this one for you further.

59428,Amazon EC2 V0,"File uploads fails at approx 60Mb We have a clouid storage application we've written that runs on Amazon EC2. The file uploads to a GlassFish isntance from where it gets stored in a database.  When we upload documents of over 60Mb the uploads at about 60Mb. This is consistent, not intermittent. We wrote a java test to write direct to the database and that worked fine.   Smaller files are uploaded and posted to the database fine.  The dev/test instances we run on our local servers work fine with much larger files.  If it was a application/glassfish config issues we'd see the same problem locally as well. We onkly get this on Amazon.  The upload is to port 8181 on the GlassFish server.  Is there some sort of limit per connection/session that is being enforced?"

59427,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  Thank You for creating this forum post. The error message you are seeing can happen due to one of the below reasons:      1) Trying to connect with the wrong key. Please check if the instance is using this keypair?     2) Trying to connect with the wrong username. ubuntu is the username for the ubuntu based AWS distribution, but on some others it's ec2-user     3) Trying to connect the wrong host. Is that the right host you are trying to log in to?  Note that 1. will also happen if any incorrect changes have been made at /home/<username>/.ssh/authorizedkeys file on your EC2 instance. In which case you will have to stop the current instance, deatch the root volume and attach to another similar temporary instance as a secondary volume and check the files and properties of the folder : ""/home/<username>/.ssh/authorizedkeys""  Once verified, you can re-attach the root volume back to the original instance as /dev/sda1, restart the instance and then try connecting to it.

59426,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  Thank You for creating this forum post. I further checked your instance and I do see the volume you are referring to:  /dev/sdb -> xvdf  This is an instance store volume. An instance store provides temporary block-level storage for use with an instance. There are no additional charges for this. It comes with few instance types. You can deselect this during the launch of the instance.   The size of an instance store ranges from 150 GiB to up to 48 TiB, and varies by instance type. I see your instance:  i-46e7c466 is having m1.small instance type which comes with 1*160GB instance store volume. Instance store volumes are usable only from a single instance during its lifetime; they can't be detached. You can deselect this volume during the launch of the instance (It is shown in the 4th step 'Add Storage').  http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html  Thanks, Sneha"

59404,Amazon EC2 V0,"Removing SQL Server license from EC2 instance? Hi  There is a similar question (unanswered) that I found but not this exact problem. I made a mistake when setting up a server, and used an m1.large instance (Windows) with SQL Server already installed. To be honest I did not realise it would be so much more expensive than an instance without SQL Server pre-installed. Is there a way to drop this down to a standard m1.large instance and remove the SQL Server license, without having to create a new instance? In order to pay the normal m1.large price.  Thanks"

And unfortunately there is no way to change the billing type of an EC2 instance once it has been launched.  Your only option here is to launch a new instance from scratch.

59403,Amazon EC2 V0,"Windows 2008 how to recover EBS and virtual directory after instance fails? I have a single EC2 Windows 2008 instance created with Elastic Beanstalk.  I add an EBS volume to it to store PDF files created by my website. I map a virtual directory to the attached drive.  The problem is every few weeks or months, not sure which, since my site is not heavily used, the instance seems to go away and is replaced by another.  However, this new instance does not have my drive mapped nor the virtual directory. Sometimes the instance comes back in a different availability zone altogether.  The only way I know this all happened is a user complains.  How am I supposed to get the whole thing to come back together automatically since it looks like this is going to be a fact of life.  I can re-attach the drive, copying to a new AZ if needed and re-create the virtual directory manually, but this is not an appropriate solution, nor is it scalable.  If someone could give me a sequence of googleable things to do, then I could take it from there.  Edit it is now about a month after the last time my instance got trashed and restarted. So, this is something that is happening fairly frequently.  Still haven't found solution.  May have to pay for help from Amazon.  Edited by: Edward Felsenthal on Feb 5, 2014 6:33 PM"

My website just doesn't resolve HTTPS no matter what I tried or read from other posts.  I bought a RapidSSL certificate and validated that my private key and certificate did match. I then followed the Amazon doc to create an ELB and install the certificate (through the management console). I did not install the certificate on my Windows EC2 instance since I selected the ELB Listener configuration HTTPS to HTTP.  When configuring the certificate for the ELB I did enter the certificate chain key, but I also tried without with no success.   I did open port 443 on my EC2 instance linked to my ELB and I also added ports 22, 80 and 443 for the security group of the ELB.  What I'm I missing?

Virginia), however there are only 2 EC2 instances running currently and the other 4 instances are Stopped.   As a first step - It would be worth confirming that your EC2 Management Console is pointed at this Region (top right hand side of the window) and then checking the running instances for the data you are looking for.  As a next step, it may be worth Starting the other EC2 instances that you have there to review the contents of those volumes to see if that contains the data that you are looking for.   I can also see that you have an S3 Bucket with data inside of that bucket. Could the data you are looking for be located there?   If you are able to clarify where your data is located (for example was on a drive attached to instance 'X' or it was located in the folder called ""X"" in the S3 bucket), we will be better placed to take a deeper look at this for you from our side.

However, if I run my scripts it crashes with this error:    File ""/home/ubuntu/Scripts/Taxon/__init__.py"", line 541, in runneedle     subprocess.call(cline, stdin=None, stdout=None, stderr=None, shell=False)   File ""/usr/lib/python2.7/subprocess.py"", line 493, in call     return Popen(*popenargs, **kwargs).wait()   File ""/usr/lib/python2.7/subprocess.py"", line 679, in __init__     errread, errwrite)   File ""/usr/lib/python2.7/subprocess.py"", line 1143, in _execute_child     self.pid = os.fork() OSError: Errno 12 Cannot allocate memory  Can anyone help me with this?

59386,Amazon EC2 V0,"Proper SSL Certificate Management for a Dynamic Number of EC2 Instances Hello,  We are developing a server that is to run on multiple AWS EC2 instances. The server application must handle SSL/TLS connections on different ports with the following levels of authentication: 1) On port A: the server will answer client connections that require only the server to be authenticated  2) On port B: the server will answer connections that require both the client and the server to be authenticated.  Furthermore, the number of EC2 instances which handle these connections will scale with the number of concurrent connections. All of the EC2 instances will be behind an elastic load balancer. The question now is how to handle our SSL certificate (signed server certificate and private key)?  The connections on port A could have the SSL/TLS security terminated at the elastic load balancer, in which case we would simply install the SSL certificate into AWS's IAM services. However, the connections on port B need to have the SSL/TLS terminated in the server application that is running on each EC2 instance to allow for proper client authentication. To do this, we will configure the elastic load balancer to directly forward any TCP connection on port B to the EC2 instance that it has selected. This means that each EC2 instance must have a copy of the server SSL certificate (signed certificate + private key).   Since we are dynamically creating and destroying EC2 instances, what is the best (most secure) way to distribute the SSL certificate? Is there a way for the EC2 instance to access the IAM store of server certificates and download the certificate? Or would we be better off storing the SSL certificate in an encrypted file (i.e. pfx) in an S3 bucket? The S3 bucket seem problematic in that we then have to securely keep track of the encryption key... Are there any recommended best practices for this scenario?  Thank you, Eric"

I am getting no route to host when attempting to establish a connection on those ports though.   First I would check to make sure your application is listening on those ports. You should be able to see this with a netstat -ln.   I would also check to see if iptables is blocking the connections. You could try a service iptables stop, then try to connect. If it works, then examine your iptables rules. You can re-enable iptables with the command, service iptables start.   Thank you,  Chris"

Can this be done on AWS? If needed we have our own licenses for R2 servers.  The only way we see right now is to start a new Windows Server 2008 R2 instance and REINSTALL ALL OUR SOFTWARE FROM SCRATCH, which pretty much blocks the upgrade, as it would take us weeks to do that and is still likely to disrupt our operations massively.

59383,Amazon EC2 V0,"Thanks Jason. I am very eagerly awaiting your verdict. At the moment this is really a huge disadvantage of running our corporate server on the cloud as opposed to locally on a physical hardware, since in the latter case there would be no problem upgrading it.

59383,Amazon EC2 V0,Hi   Our windows Engineering team have confirmed at the moment there are no procedures to upgrade from one version of Windows to a different version of Windows in EC2.  So the only option right now is to spin up a replacement Windows 2008R2 and install your application stack and migrate your data.  I am sorry that there is no simple fix for this issue right now.  Even if you tried an in place upgrade this will fail as when you have loaded the install files and the server reboots to finish the install you would require console access to complete the set-up steps.  Regards JasonM
59383,Amazon EC2 V0,Thanks for getting back on this one Jason. I have a few follow up questions:  1)Would I not be able to use normal RDC after the Windows Server 2008 R1 restarts to complete its upgrade to Windows Server 2008 R2?  2)Are Amazon engineers working on offering upgrade feature in some near future? Due to the amount of installed software stack and the complexity of its configuration this is by no means a trivial task to reinstall and reconfigure the whole software stack from R1 to R2. It would potentially take days and even then a lot of services are likely to fail due to some hard to foresee problems.

59383,Amazon EC2 V0,"Thanks Pada, that certainly seems to be the case.  Really wish AWS provided some kind of console to systems like other providers.  It's rare when it's needed, but would really help in cases like this or when a critical server has a filesystem error, etc.  Sure you can always just restore a known good backup, but with console you may be able to resolve more quickly.

We now want to switch over to SQL Server 2008 Standard, keeping everything else the same.  I have a few questions:  1) Can we simply switch in the same instance?

The phenomenon is not consistent, I can sometimes access the server after a reboot, but sometimes I cannot. Most of the time I cannot.  I can access that server with private IP address from another instance, so I am guessing that association between the EIP and the private IP is not properly made after a reboot.

With an update of packages, your existing configuration will not be overwritten, just make sure that the /etc/php.ini points to the right file. If you don't want your configuration to be read twice, just remove the symlink in /etc/php-5.5.d. Its not a problem for the php.ini to be read twice, unless you override configuration values in module ini files whose name starts with a letter that comes before the letter p. This is because after php reads the php.ini file, it reads the ini files in the module configuration directory (/etc/php-5.5.d in this case) in alphabetical order - applying configuration values as it goes along.

59363,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello 2os,  Thanks for reporting the issue and we're sorry that you're experiencing this issue.  I will follow up with the Spot team and we will work on getting these fixed as soon as possible and provide an update.  Until then, as you pointed out, null pointer exception is benign and for now, its safe to ignore it. You can probably add something like '2>/dev/null' to your command to ignore all errors.   Thanks, Aniruddha."

59355,Amazon EC2 V0,"As with most issues of EC2 connectivity, the top three reasons that it fails are:  1. Unable to resolve ec2.amazonaws.com to an IP because the DNS resolvers given to the Connector cannot resolve that hostname.  2. A firewall rule is preventing the Connector from leaving the internal network, or the internal network does not have access directly to the Internet due to a lack of a firewall rule allowing it.  3. Internet access requires a proxy and the proxy is not configured or misconfigured within the Connector.  I hope those three general tips help."

59355,Amazon EC2 V0,"You can troubleshoot networking and DNS issues by logging into the console of the Connector vApp.  You'll need to have access to vSphere in order to access the client.  This is the same console that you used to get the URL IP and password for the Connector configuration web app.  Connect to the Console, login with the username 'root' and an empty password.  NOTE:  Console access, by default, is NOT network accessible.  The only network accessible services on the Connector vApp are its two web servers.  The vApp is running within VMware and Console access is only accessible via vCenter or vSphere.  For additional access control, login to the vApp via Console and change the password from its default by using the 'passwd' command and following the prompts.  To check connectivity, first try to ping the default gateway by running ping 1.2.3.4 on the command line.  If you get a response, hit CTRL-C to quit ping.  If this does not succeed, you'll need to contact your network administrator to determine why you are unable to reach your default gateway.  You can continue the troubleshooting, as ICMP (ping) may have been disabled on your default gateway for security reasons.  A non-successful ping does not mean that the Connector is not on the network.  Next check DNS resolution by running dig +short +identify ec2.amazonaws.com and you should get an IP address, likely starting with 72, 204 or 207, followed by the text from server 10.0.0.34 in 5ms.  If you get no output from the command, your DNS server may not be configured correctly, or may not be reachable.  To see what DNS server is being queried, run the command 'dig ec2.amazonaws.com' and look near the bottom of the output for ;; SERVER: 10.0.0.34 and this is your DNS server.  If this is not the correct DNS server, you may need to set up a static IP address and static DNS servers for the Connector vApp.  If your DNS servers exist outside your firewall, you'll need to allow access to those DNS servers through the firewall from the Connector vApp IP address.  You'll also need to open port 443 to the Internet from the Connector vApp IP.  I hope this helps!  Pedro AWS EC2 VM Import"
59355,Amazon EC2 V0,"Thanks for the reply, Pedro. I know how to troubleshoot DNS, I just didn't know how to login into the console.

59350,Amazon EC2 V0,"What is difference between Light and Medium utilization m3.medium? I'm looking to purchase a Reserved Instance Windows 2008 R2 + SQL Server 2008 Express + IIS  What is the difference between:  Light Utilization:  1 Year m3.medium $129 up front,  $0.107 per Hour  3 year m3.medium $199 up front,  $0.092 per Hour   and   Medium Utilization  1 Year m3.medium $299 up front,  $0.079 per Hour 3 year m3.medium  $468 up front  $0.07 per Hour   ...besides the price"
59350,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,   The difference in the light utilization and heavy utilization is planned instance running time.   If you purchase a light usage reserved instance, you can stop the instance at any time to reduce your costs. So if you plan to use your instance 6 hours a day, you pay the upfront costs, and the reduced rate for those 6 hours.   If you plan to run your instance 24/7 you can select heavy usage, which will have a higher upfront fee, but a lower hourly rate, saving more money than the light usage plan would.   For more information you can see this document.  http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/purchasing-options/reserved-instances/  Thank you,  Chris"

59349,Amazon EC2 V0,"I must say that I'm quite disappointed from Amazon's Technical customer service. Asking me to pay for help with a general problems such as ""Is XXX possible?"" or ""How do I XXX?"", raises the dilemma whether choosing AWS was the right decision.  If I'll want something fast, I can understand the extra costs, but a general question on how to use AWS or if something is available seems to me as complementary service."
59349,Amazon EC2 V0,"I can understand your feelings somewhat, but here's a counterpoint to consider:  Most AWS customers do not need the type of one-on-one help you described.  If Amazon were to provide that service to you at no charge, the only way for them to pay that staff's salary would be to increase prices generally for the rest of us.  By charging only the people who do need that extra help, Amazon keeps prices low for the rest of us who don't need the help."
59349,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi Larry,  Thanks for your response!  I'm not asking for one-on-one help, but rather the ability to submit a ""Technical Case"" the same way I can do with ""Billing Case"".  I also understands your contention about Amazon's prices, but enabling their ""Paying Users"" (e.g., not free tier) to submit few (lets say up to 10) cases a year seems to me as a good solution.

59346,Amazon EC2 V0,"Using Server-Sent Events with an ELB I have a simple NodeJS (v0.10.24) application broadcasting Server-Sent Events that I'm trying to run on EC2 with an ELB in front of it. The ELB has a single listener from HTTP 80 through to 3000, and a healthcheck on /. When I Curl the EC2 machine, I get the events as I would expect -- but not when I try to go through the ELB?  The server NodeJS application using Express:  var express = require('express') var app = express()   app.get('/', function (request, response) {     response.end('hello healthcheck') })   app.get('/test', function (request, response) {     console.log('received request...')     request.setTimeout(Infinity)     response.writeHead(200, {         'Content-Type': 'text/event-stream',         'Cache-Control': 'no-cache'     })     setInterval(function () {         response.write('data: ' + new Date() + '\n\n')     }, 1000) })   app.listen(3000) console.log('started...')

59345,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,   To modify the fstab please stop this instance deatch the root volume and attach it to another running instance as for example /dev/sdf .  One you have it attached mount the file system and modify the broken fstab. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-detaching-volume.html  The other point to note is that usually an NFS mount should look like this: 1.2.3.4:/var/nfs  /mnt/nfs/var/nfs ...  In your case /dev/xvdj is used as the device, I checked your instances and one instance which seems to be the instance in question does not have any volume attached to it as /dev/xvdj .  Can you please clarify what you are trying to achieve so we can assist you further.  Please also confirm the instance id of the instance here.  Kind regards,  Mostafa S."
59345,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi Mostafa,  Thanks a lot for the information and i was able to resolve the issue by mounting the volume to another instance and modifying the fstab entries.  The server is up & running now and EBS is also mounted for NFS.  Actually i was trying to do configuration for automatically mounting the EBS volume after reboot. The EBS volume /dev/xvdj is nfs mounted across other six servers.  Instance ID : i-9edfcfa2 Mounted vol :  vol-5532bc02  Kindly let me know how can i configure the EBS volume /dev/xvdj in fstab entry for auto mounting after reboot?  Thanks Dinaz"

But it is very slow,apache page is also not opening.  But if we Map another elastic IP to these instances,it works good. So the problem is with the particular Elastic IPs?? in the US-region.

59343,Amazon EC2 V0,"Spot Instance Request assigns availability zone even when not specified I haven't been able to spin up spot instances in eu-west-1 datacenter for the past few days due to 'price too low' condition.  It turns out that eu-west-1b is consistently super high prices and my spot requests are getting assigned to that availability zone even when I don't care which zone it is in.  I figured it might be an api issue since I am using an older api rev, but even using the AWS console, it auto assigned eu-west-1b as the availability zone.  Please look at sir-43d16a5d, which was created by the console without specifying a subnet or availability zone, but is assigned to eu-west-1b anyway. This is artificially raising the prices of that zone and will probably be a sticker shock for some very angry customers.  Is this a bug?  Edited by: lidat on Feb 4, 2014 12:10 AM"
59342,Amazon EC2 V0,not get logs details how to up the instance Hi     I have once instance  i-68d96b61 which I created from my snapshot. when I launched it has status check and not able to access. I tried to check the log also but nothing found which can help to up my instance.  I would like that anybody would guide me to diagnose the same.
59342,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi,  Having a look at your instance, I am not seeing a specific explicit error that stands out.  It must be noted that for security purposes we do not have access to customer instances however.  Some common issues could arise from the use of a different AKI(The one you selected  	aki-6065f250 works fine for me however), Different mappings in your Fstab, and so forth.  As we do not have the exact configurations of your Instance, please consider performing the following: note, I am getting console out put which makes me believe that IP configuration is not the issue.  Check your mapping in the etc/fstab to verify if they are valid. To do this, and verify any other discrepancies, you can attach your root EBS volume to a newly created instance, or add a volume to a new instance upon startup, and select the snapshot it should be based off of.   Next, you can chroot to the attached secondary volume, and perform commands on it as if it where your root volume.  Do you per chance still have the Original instance?  Regards, Coenraad"
59342,Amazon EC2 V0,Hi     I have created new instance and attached the image which having the issue  via EBS.  and changed the /etc/fstab and save.    this changes done will solve my issue ??
59342,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi there,  did you get a chance to reattach the volume to the instance that wasn't working, and see if it boots after you've made the fstab changes?  I can see that the original instance is stopped at the moment, so if you can let me know how you got on we can take it from there.  Cheers Iain"
59342,Amazon EC2 V0,Yes   I have the following image ec2-snapshot-image - ami-54b1d064 so via EBS I have mounted the same.  But still having the same problem. See I have started the again.
59341,Amazon EC2 V0,"Amazon Linux AMI missing important binaries The strip binary is used when building the initramfs. It is contained in the binutils package. Without it, updating the kernel throws a warning:  Installing : kernel-3.4.76-65.111.amzn1.x86_64                                 100/207  W: Could not find 'strip'. Not stripping binaries in the initramfs.   The lsb_release binary is used by many applications, which assume it is installed and use it for various purposes. Without it, installing many packages fails, or the resulting software is missing directories and various other components. Example: Cassandra RPM packages. It is contained in the redhat-lsb-core package.  Usually, doing a 'sudo yum install redhat-lsb-core' will install both redhat-lsb-core and binutils. However, these are important packages, that should exist from the very beginning.  Please add these packages to the default list for the Linux AMI."
59341,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi,  The redhat-lsb package is available in the Amazon Linux AMI repositories, but it is not part of the default AMI package set.  The same is true of the binutils package, which can be installed on its own with ""yum install binutils"" or as part of the large dependency chain that will be brought in by installing redhat-lsb.  The reason why neither of these packages are on the default Amazon Linux AMI is because one of our goals with the Amazon Linux AMI is to keep the base package set as minimal as possible, while making it easy for people to extend the AMI.  You're already installing the Cassandra RPMs on your image, so perhaps you could install binutils or redhat-lsb (whatever your preference is) along with that installation.  CloudInit should be a useful tool for that particular use case, and if you need some examples we'd be happy to provide it.  I hope this helps, and thank you for using the Amazon Linux AMI."
59340,Amazon EC2 V0,"Can't reach Django default app via Gunicorn on AWS EC2 instance I've been struggling with this problem for two days without success.

I do have nginx installed but I don't have the nginx service running.  I did try starting it up and enabling an nginx virtual server using the following configuration file but the error still occurred.  	upstream testdj_app_server { 	    server unix:/usr/share/nginx/html/testdj/run/gunicorn.sock fail_timeout=0; 	} 	server { 	    listen 80; 	    server_name ec2-my-public-dns-ip.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com; 	    client_max_body_size 4G; 	    access_log /var/log/nginx/testdj-access.log; 	    error_log /var/log/nginx/testdj-error.log;  	    location /static/ { 	        alias /usr/share/nginx/html/testdj/static/; 	    } 	    location /media/ { 	        alias /usr/share/nginx/html/testdj/media/; 	    } 	    location / { 	        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; 	        proxy_set_header Host $http_host; 	        proxy_redirect off;    	        if (!-f $request_filename) { 	            # This must match ""upstream"" directive above 	            proxy_pass http://testdj_app_server; 	            break; 	        } 	    } 	    error_page 500 502 503 504 /500.html; 	    location = /500.html { 	        root /usr/share/nginx/html/testdj/static/; 	    } 	}  The problem seems to be with gunicorn because if I replace the ""--bind=unix:$SOCKFILE"" in my start-gunicorn script with ""--bind --ec2-public-dns:8000"", I can see the Django default page.  However, I don't want to bind to my public DNS name on port 8000, I want to run on port 80 and use nginx as my front end reverse proxy.  I initially had AWS inbound security group rules that limited access to the site to HTTP on ports 80, 8000, and 8001 to my laptop but even if I delete these rules and leave the site wide open, I still get the 502 error message.  My gunicorn access log doesn't show any activity and the only thing I see in the gunicorn error log is gunicorn starting up.  When I access the default Django page, there are no errors in the error log:  	2014-02-03 18:41:01 19023 INFO Starting gunicorn 18.0 	2014-02-03 18:41:01 19023 DEBUG Arbiter booted 	2014-02-03 18:41:01 19023 INFO Listening at: unix:/usr/share/nginx/html/testdj/run/gunicorn.sock (19023) 	2014-02-03 18:41:01 19023 INFO Using worker: sync 	2014-02-03 18:41:01 19068 INFO Booting worker with pid: 19068 	2014-02-03 18:41:01 19069 INFO Booting worker with pid: 19069 	2014-02-03 18:41:01 19070 INFO Booting worker with pid: 19070  The default nginx user ""www-data"" owns everything below /usr/share/nginx except /usr/share/nginx/html/testdj which is owned by the application's user ""testdj.""  www-data does belong to the group ""testdj"" and it does have write access to all directories at or below /usr/share/nginx/html/testdj, particularly the run directory which contains the gunicorn.sock file which it has write access to.

59330,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  If you wanted to be able to share files between your two VPC you would need a VPN connection between them. Another way you could do this, epically if this is not something that you do very often, would be to create a new instance that has access to the Internet.

This would allow you to download the file and move it accordingly.   I hope this helps,  -AdamC"

59329,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  Thank you for using the AWS forums. There may be a chance that there could be a hardware issue, I will need the instance ID to be able to verify that for you. A few other things to note, our cloud watch metrics do not represent the exact CPU usage inside the OS. These are a reflection of our Elastic Compute Units. You can view more about that here:  http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/  *Q: What is a “EC2 Compute Unit” and why did you introduce it?  Amazon EC2 uses a variety of measures to provide each instance with a consistent and predictable amount of CPU capacity. In order to make it easy for developers to compare CPU capacity between different instance types, we have defined an Amazon EC2 Compute Unit. The amount of CPU that is allocated to a particular instance is expressed in terms of these EC2 Compute Units. We use several benchmarks and tests to manage the consistency and predictability of the performance from an EC2 Compute Unit. The EC2 Compute Unit (ECU) provides the relative measure of the integer processing power of an Amazon EC2 instance. Over time, we may add or substitute measures that go into the definition of an EC2 Compute Unit, if we find metrics that will give you a clearer picture of compute capacity.*  Also, you may want to verify you are running the Top command as root. This will make sure you see all of the processes running on the instance.  I hope this helps,  -AdamC"

If so, is it possible that they may have blacklisted the EIP of the instance that is not working properly?

It's currently running on a dedicated security group which is more open than the other groups, and yet this is the one that is struggling. If you check i-3f902447 and its security group you should see that it is much more restrictive, yet this one was able to download from the FTP server with no problem at all.  Shortly after I posted it did connect and download the necessary file, which is all the more confusing, because neither I nor the vendor have changed anything. The EIP may have been blacklisted somewhere along the line, but oddly we could connect to one of their other servers, and last week when we tried it was somewhat intermittent. Sometimes we couldn't connect at all, sometimes we could, but the data that came down always seemed to be cut off short."

Check the event viewer logs on this secondary volume (specially the System logs and the Application logs)   Identify if you see any issues here.

59318,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi Dmitry  I had a look at the instance in question and noted that it is waiting for meta-data availability. This typically occurs if a static IP is set on the instance that is incorrect. Did you set a static IP on this instance? Since this instance is also in EC2-Classic instead of a VPC, regaining access to the instance will require offline registry edits.  In order to reset DHCP, please do the following:  1: Take a snapshot of the root volume of the instance as a backup 2: Launch a new windows instance for troubleshooting 3: Detach the root volume from the original instance 4: Attach the volume to the new instance (not as a boot drive) 5: Bring the disk online in Windows as D: 6: Mount the original instance registry at D:\Windows\System32\config\SYSTEM as HKLM\TEST 7: Check the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\TEST\ControlSet001\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\Interfaces\ registry keys for EnableDHCP to ensure it is turned on, and remove and static settings 8: Unload the hive, detach the volume, re-attach the volume to the original instance and then launch the original instance.  If a static IP was not set on the instance but OpenVPN was installed, that may be the culprit. Disabling OpenVPN from starting may resolve the issue. Please see the following article for instructions:  http://support.microsoft.com/kb/165748  Regards, Monique B"

59314,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi there!  For the specific instance type to use, don't forget that you can change instance type when you need - so you can start small with low costs and then scale up (by changing instance types) or scale out (by adding more smaller instances through Autoscaling) depending on your needs.  Resizing your instance: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-resize.html  Adding more storage: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-expand-volume.html  Autoscaling: http://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/  Our Architecture Diagram here can give you a good idea of how a well-designed, scalable and highly available setup on AWS can look like: http://media.amazonwebservices.com/architecturecenter/AWS_ac_ra_web_01.pdf  We also have a tutorial on setting up Wordpress on AWS here: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/hosting-wordpress.html  You can use a t1.micro and take advantage of our Free Tier to deploy a test WP site if you like.  If you're looking to see what each instance type give you, our page here details the instance types: http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/instance-details/  Just to point out - the Instance Storage on that page refers to Ephemeral storage, which is tied to the specific hardware that the instance is launched on, so when the instance is stopped, or launched on new hardware, that data does not persist. You can use this fast storage for caching, swap etc, so it's best used for temporary, fast storage.   For persistent storage, where your data is kept when you stop the instance, you can use our EBS volumes: http://aws.amazon.com/ebs/  You can add EBS volumes to your instance (or configure them to be added when you launch the instance) - this is where you'll store your website data etc so that it is retained when you stop / start.

59304,Amazon EC2 V0,"EBS: 30+ millions I/O during 24 hours - why?? Hello,  A EC2 Micro instance that I keep running for several years, srarting from yesterday began to generate insane EBS I/O operations count, thus inflating my bill significantly.  I would like to request Support assistance to understand why it is happening. The EC2 is rather idle instance. It performs several backup operations once a day. The amount of data being transferred didn't change. All average activity didn't change. Yet I see how more and more tens of millions EBS I/O are being counted on almost absolutely idle instance.  It's AWS Management Console Monitoring graphs show almost no I/O during last 24 hours - yet several tens of million I/O are counted in account activity. Why??  I have checked the instance. No suspicious activity, no traces of unauthorized access, virus infection, whatever. It simply started generating many I/O operations without any reason, remaining mostly idle and not changing its operating pattern.  I do not wish to dismantle the instance and setting it up again, since there's no guarantee new instance won't plagues by the same problem.  Instance ID: i-9854aff7  Thanks in advance."
59304,Amazon EC2 V0,"Do I understand correctly that no one from Amazon staff cares to investigate this?  The instance consumed 3.2 million I/O in October, 2013 2.0 million I/O in September, 2013 1.94 million I/O in August, 2013 2.25 million I/O in july, 2013  and so on, the average consumption is around 2 millions for many month.  It consumed more than 70 million during last 2 days. I would like to know explanation how that is possible when monitoring shows almost zero I/O activity during that period."

59304,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi Konstantin,   I've taken a look at your instance, and I can see quite a large spike on the NetworkIn and NetworkOut graphs. The traffic almost trippled compared to normal usage on other days. This would seem to be what has caused the high IO usage during the last 24 hours.   Could you kindly check your syslogs for any relevant issues.   I have also taken a look at your security groups and I would also recommend ensuring that certain of your ports are only opened to the IP address from where you connect.   Regards, Belynda"
59304,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi johnh1981,  I have also taken a look at your instances.  Instance: i-ddf5e9ba, is showing a large spike in NetworkIn and NetworkOut. Can you confirm if this volume of traffic is expected for this instance?   Also this instance is sitting at 100% CPU usage, which may explain the ""instance not responding"" error you are experiencing. This indicates the instance is not coping under the load, and you may need to consider upgrading to a bigger instance type, depending on your use case.

59304,Amazon EC2 V0,"Thanks Belynda for looking into this.  It's been running the exact same routine as previous months so this ~1000x increase in EBS IO is hard to fathom.  The network in/out spike is probably just due to the instance coming back online since it had been unresponsive for quite a while.  It's operating normally now.    While it may have said 100% capacity, it wasn't doing anything.  It wasn't responsive to ssh or http.  The only thing this instance does is run a routine that uploads data to s3 and updates dynamodb, and none of that was occurring.   There's nothing in the routine that even writes to storage.  I sense that maybe when the instance is in this locked state, it's misreporting somehow.  edit: On Nov 8th I received an AWS email about a security issue: http://wiki.bitnami.com/security/2013-11_PHP_security_issue  It's possible this could have something to do with it.  I'm pretty sure I replaced an instance around that time after I ran the preventative security measure and saved a new AMI, but access logs indicate that attempts were clearly being made on the instance I'm running now, so I can't say what may have been occurring on the previous instance.  These attempts could at least explain how it got in a locked state since it had been running smoothly on a micro-instance without a hiccup, and well below 100%, for weeks and weeks.

I am asking about period approx. 96 hours earlier, clearly mentioned in original post.  Once again, in case you didn't pay attention:  there was no disk-intensive disk I/O, nor network activity - yoru own monitoring can prive that there was no security breach/unauthorized acccess/anything of the kind   Yet the instance generated approx 70 millions I/O of operations. It's average is 2.2 a month. I check its functioning - there was nothing extraordinary.  I am sure the mentioned 70 million for which I am assumed to pay aren't really generated by EC2 instance, it's kind of bug/glitch outside virtual machine.  Please analyse that.

The answer which I have no answer to is how can I see what caused high I/O from EC2 virtualization ""viewpoint"" - since I was watching the instance inside and saw no high I/O at all.   Is the above possible, or I shall pay for every EBS glitch in the future as well? Next time it happens, I will have little choice but to move out of AWS entirely and warn everyone I recommended AWS services to about the issue, so that they won't had the same issue.  Thanks."
59304,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello Konstantin,  Customer Service are still examining the actually IO counts for this volume, and we will update you on this.  In the mean time, I just had another look at this instance, and I notice that it appears you may have configured swap on it.  Since this is a t1.micro and it does not have any instance store volumes, and t1.micro's have only 620MB of memory, configuring swap on an EBS volume can expose you to very large IO charges if the instance enters swap, so as a general practice, from a cost-management perspective, once should keep this in mind when configuring swap on EBS volumes."
59304,Amazon EC2 V0,"I understand that. However, swap was active for quite  a time and I performed monitoring to ensure it's not causing excessive I/O. As I said, operation pattern didn't change over months, no excessive load/unusually high activity happened.  I have disabled swapping to EBS to compare results.  Note that the issue has been resolved by the moment. The only question remaining is whether I can use monitoring data, in case similar issue happens again, to show the actual I/O usage.  And if data collected from inside instance won't do, what data can prove there's miscalculation of I/O.  Thanks!"

59302,Amazon EC2 V0,"Stale PTR records as possible source of problems Hello,  In short, the situation I witnessed recently.  There's a site, say example.com, hosted outside AWS. DNS records for the domain, including PTR, are set up correctly, everything's fine.  The site is migrated to AWS EC2. Another (elastic) IP is assigned and used, everything's fine.  Several months later the following happens: IP, previously used at the previous hosting provider, still using PTR record pointing at example.com, is taken by a spammer.  The spammer  sends bulk email, using @example.com as the Reply-To base.  An angry receiver of such an email posts complaint to SpamCop. SpamCop doesn't check that false PTR record has nothing to do with example.com (i.e., no A/AAAA records of example.com match the offending IP) and passes complaint to AWS EC2 Abuse team.  Looks like AWS EC2 Abuse made no checks, either, since it warns the domain/site owner about violating one of the strictest anti-spam rules.  Question 1: is the above an unlucky exception, or the Abuse team performs no checks of whether IP/DNS records are related to the site in question?  Question 2: what is the quickest means to sort out the above, if one domain is framed like described above?  If no checks are made, then the above scenario is the quickest means to create troubles for any legitimate owner of a domain hosted at AWS EC2: create a false PTR record and abuse the corresponding IP.  JFYI, it's not me who was hit by the above events. I suggested the person to contact Abuse team and tell the whole story , and make sure the offending PTR is removed.  Thanks.

59297,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello P,  This might not be exactly the information that you are after but it's worth noting that while S3 is reliable and highly durable storage option it might not be the best option to use as a SQL server data directory due to network latency between the compute and storage.  Having said that if you want to use S3 for storing SQL server backups then that is a good option. you can use third party software that provides S3 as local file system functionality. Please see the following table for a comparison of different options: https://code.google.com/p/s3ql/wiki/other_s3_filesystems  This way you would see your bucket as a local driver and work with it that way. As mentioned there are good reasons though why the presented filesystem should not be used as data directory:   Network latency between EC2 and S3 ( in comparison with EBS )  Data consistency in S3: buckets in the US Standard Region provide eventual consistency.  other regions provide read-after-write consistency for PUTS of new objects and eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES.  For a file system you need actual consistency   S3 is an object store a block based store, small changes in a file will lead to get and put the whole object in S3   In terms of access from Python you can use AWS SDK for Python (Boto) to call APIs and work with objects in S3. http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforpython/  Finally in terms of access you can assign a role to your instance and give enough permission to the role to be able to access the bucket: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/role-usecase-ec2app.html  Hope this helps.  Kind regards,  Mostafa S."
59297,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello Mostafa,  Thanks a lot for your detailed reply. I was fearing the latency issues and you confirmed my skepticism. I do understand that accessing SQL Server data dump on S3 from SQL Server installed on EC2 may not be a very good idea, but do you have any alternatives to this?  My datafile is 4TB+ uncompressed (100GB compressed - the original 4TB data dump has been compressed into .bak format which is further compressed using 7 zip). I had earlier tried using just EC2 (I still have an RDP machine on EC2) but I cannot have a single disk partition which is 5TB, which is why I thought of moving to S3. I don't think the .bak file (which will be restored on SQL Server) can be split into pieces so that the pieces can sit on different partitions. Even if that's possible, I am assuming it is going to be very messy. FYI, the whole .bak file forms a single database. Also, the partitions can only be 1TB max, I can have multiple partitions though.  As per my understanding, wasn't S3 designed to be accessed from EC2? Please correct me if I am wrong.

59289,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  When you terminate your instance the data on it is automatically deleted and overwritten to prevent recovery.

Which of these do I need to delete in order for AWS to completely stop charging me?   Thanks"
59284,Amazon EC2 V0,There is a small hourly charge for leaving an Elastic IP unused (as in not assigned to a running EC2 instance). You will also be billed for the amount of storage you have provisioned for your volume.
59284,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  Out of the 3 things you have mentioned, EBS volume and the elastic IP will incur fees. Because AWS will charge you for the elastic IPs that are not attached to any instance. EIPs are free as long as they are attached to an instance.

59283,Amazon EC2 V0,Odd ... It never shows Rebooting in the AWS Admin Console and didn't even think to check the instance console.  Any idea why it wouldn't show the instance in a Rebooting state?
59283,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  It looks like what you saw is the expected behavior. I understand it can be confusing a bit. But when you do a reboot, it's a soft reboot and as far as the instance itself is concerned it's in a ""running"" state. The ""Operating system"" inside it is the one that's rebooting.  Reboot request basically queues a reboot operation for that instance while it's running as mentioned in here - http://aws.amazon.com/articles/622  AWS console at the moment shows only the behavior of the instance itself, which is running, stopped or terminated states under ""instance state"". Even with these, it'll be helpful to keep pressing the refresh button on the top right hand corner to get the latest state as auto-refresh might not be frequent enough to see certain operations.  Hope this explains? Thanks, Amo"

59282,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi,  I've investigated the health state of your instance and it looks like it's running in a healthy state as well for the underlying hardware, however it seems to fail the reach-ability checks. That means the network interface at the operating system level is not responding.  At this point, my recommendation would be to create an AMI from this instance and launch it in the VPC - public subnet. In this way it's reachable from the internet.  Reference at http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/default-vpc.html If the health state remains the same, you can than attach a second Elastic Network Interface and an Elastic IP.

Regards, Valentin R."
59282,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi, Many thanks for the quick response, but as it is sat in 'awaiting metadata' I believe that means that at the basic hardware level it cannot communicate with the AWS management system to attach drives, etc. So believe this is at the vm level? Very Best, Lee."
59282,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi, I did also try the image in a vpc environment as suggested but could not connect remotely or locally through using another standard instance in the vpc even with add network adapter.  Is it possible that this is an ec2config service issue as this system would not have been updated for some long long time? Asking as on another account we had similar style issues & whereby initial symptom was that additional drives would not be necessary online on startup: which occurred with this instance yesterday.. I'm recreating from old image / manual copy/resync..  Many Thanks, Lee."
59282,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello Lee,  This behavior can usually happen due to a couple of reasons,  1) AMI used for launching the instance having a static IP setup instead of DHCP 2) Sometimes, if it's a very old AMI, could be a PV driver incompatibility issue as well. In that case you may need to upgrade the drivers of the instance where you originally created the AMI from and re-create a new AMI.  More info on how to upgrade PV drivers - http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/Upgrading_PV_drivers.html#win2003-citrix-upgrade  However, I have escalated your issue with our EC2 engineering team to take a deeper look in to what's going on. And will give you an update as soon as we hear from them.  In the meantime, you may also try to stop and start the instance a couple of times to see if it helps as it moves on to different hardware every time you stop |start.  Thank you. Amo"
59281,Amazon EC2 V0,"reliable detection of instance termination? Hello,  I'd like to ask if there is a reliable way of detecting an instance termination (preferably from a process running inside the instance being terminated).  So far, I'm aware of the following events leading to instance termination: 1. running 'sudo shutdown -hP now' 2. Using the API to do ""ec2 terminate-instance"" 3. Selecting ""terminate"" from the AWS web console 4. Selecting ""stop"" from the AWS web console 5. Spot-instances terminated due to price rising.  I have configured a Linux AMI which has scripts running on system shutdown - but these scripts are only executed sometimes during events #2, #4, #5. I can always detect a shutdown if I initiated it (event #1),  and I was never able to detect a shutdown because of terminate (event #3).  So far, I'm only able to detect early termination indicrectly, by continuesly polling the instance's status - that's very ugly and inefficient.  I don't ask for a long ""orderly"" shutdown - just a way to get the tinest message from the instance to the outside world (e.g. visiting a URL, send SQS, etc.).  Is there any such way, which will work reliably?  Many thanks,  -gordon"
59281,Amazon EC2 V0,"Unfortunately, your instance will only run its shutdown scripts when it is asked nicely to shut down. In the terminate case, this is akin to walking over to the machine and yanking out the power plug.  It has no warning that it is being shut down, so can't possibly run the shutdown scripts.  For the #1 case, is it possible that the shutdown itself in interfering with the notification?  Some shutdown scripts will include a sleep, so that there's enough time for the message to be delivered.  You'd also need to send the message early enough in the shutdown that all your network devices are still up.  Our CloudTrail product might help you by logging API calls."
59281,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello Michael,  Just to verify: will the ""Cloud Trail"" method also record termination due to Spot-Instances price increase? (i.e. when it's not me who initiated the shutdown API request) ?  Thanks,  -gordon"
59281,Amazon EC2 V0,"It claims to record all API usage, so I assume so, but I'm afraid I don't know for certain.  You might ask your question in their forum.    On the other hand, it appears that CloudTrail can take up to 15 minutes to report, which might be too long for your uses anyway."

(Typically, it does nto seem to take long to get the meta-data.)  P.S.S. In change to the m3.2xlarge, could something on the instance have changed such that it is messed up even as its original m1.large size?  Perhaps some change on the root volume even?  UPDATE: I'd still like answers if possible, but  our original instance i-4f27d808 is being retired.  I launched a new clone from an AMI taken a month ago.  I detached all volumes, (except the root), from the original and replaced the corresponding ""month old"" volumes from the new instance.  I took care to take from ""xvdf"" and attach to the new ""xvdf"", ""xvdj"" to ""xvdj"", and so on.  The new instance booted, and I was back right where I left off, no loss.  Apparently the root volume got messed with; was it the launch as an m3.2xlarge?  Would that have made some change on the root volume?  Was this a freak occurrence?  (We'll be doing some experiments changing non-production copies of our m1.large instances to m3.whatever instances to see how we fare.

59253,Amazon EC2 V0,"Why is my EBS so fast! Maybe this is a strange question but I don't believe on magic.  I have a several instances where I am running a file-based NoSQL persistent object store.  I use micro, small and medium instances with Amazon Linux and 8-10GB EBS in various regions.  When I monitor the attached EBS volumes I generally see zero, yes ZERO, reads.  The data throughput is not large but certainly touches at least 500M of the store daily (the busiest drive has around 150 * 5M datastores representing around 200 concurrent users). So, I am assuming that there is a caching layer, perhaps initialized on instance start, that means I rarely touch the physical drive.  I am also assuming that if I currently benefit from a specific cache effect, that at some point I would cross a threshold and the cache would not be as effective (all IO is random access, so cache efficiency could easily take a sudden dive).  Any explanation welcome!  PS - To be clear not only do I observe no reads in the EBS stats, I also experience incredibly good performance.  I have not benchmarked the IO, but I do observe consistent sub 10ms web server request processing that I know is making several disk accesses.  Edited by: copperfieldr on Jan 31, 2014 3:28 AM"

59249,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  I checked your instance and notice you have already stopped it. I believe you tried stopping and starting this instance a few times and it still fails does it?  Most likely reason for this behavior is the instance not being able to connect to the network. Which happens most commonly when the AMI has a static IP defined instead of the original settings for DHCP. I noticed that you are using a custom AMI to launch this instance, is this the behavior of all instances launched using this AMI (if you haven't please try launching a different instance from the same AMI)? Also, have you had defined a static IP by any chance when creating the AMI?  Also, it's good to do a sysprep (via EC2Config service) as instructed in the following document before creating an AMI for windows instances as it resets all that particular host specific details.  http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/UsingConfig_WinAMI.html#UsingConfig_StopDelete  Try creating a new AMI if you can following the instructions and see what happens.

59246,Amazon EC2 V0,"SOLUTION -- Port 25 wasn't the best port to use for gmail smtp. Port 587 is really the one that works best. Using 587 it sends out the emails every time, promptly."
59246,Amazon EC2 V0,"This problem is obviously solved, but I just wanted to mention that there are email limitations in place by default. Here's the form you can fill out to have them removed:  Request to Remove Email Sending Limitations  You don't necessarily need them removed as you're now using a port other than 25, but in case you are sending to other people then you might want to send in a request anyway. Submitting your Elastic IP and setting up reverse DNS will make you look more credible."
59246,Amazon EC2 V0,What are the sending email limitations?
59246,Amazon EC2 V0,"I don't have any exact numbers (and don't know if they are even published), but AWS is basically limiting the amount of email you can push over port 25. This can manifest itself as intermittent issues. It's only port 25 though, so using 587 does not get you into trouble."
59245,Amazon EC2 V0,"Auto Scaling termination policy I can't get AS termination policies to work.  Background: we provide a B2B service for US businesses, so we have a cyclical demand that we scale up/down for on a schedule.  Sometimes I roll a fresh AMI with updates to our codebase & system configuration, and leave it to gradually roll out.  At one point, I was using the Default termination policy, which worked well enough except it would seem to prefer ""closest to instance hour"" above ""oldest launch configuration"".  So, I tried setting other termination policies using the command line, similar to this:  as-update-auto-scaling-group PortalSG --termination-policies ""OldestLaunchConfiguration,OldestInstance""   I've also tried simply OldestInstance, and the EC2 web console is reporting my current configuration is ""OldestLaunchConfiguration, OldestInstance, Default"".  In no case does AWS seem to be honoring these; the newest instance is consistently the one killed after close-of-business for everyone.  Today, I have two instances running in us-east-1:  i-8222b7ac has been up 10 hours with PortalLC_140127 (it's today's fresh machine using a launch configuration created Monday) but i-6cf1644d has been running for 79 hours and was launched with PortalLC_140124.  It should have come up around 34 hours ago, and have been on the 0127 launch config, if everything were working as planned.  Am I doing something wrong here?  To prevent machines from drifting too far off the current AMI, I prefer the oldest one to be killed when scaling down."
59244,Amazon EC2 V0,"ELB and IPv6 not working I've just finished tracking down an issue where a small number of users were reporting that our android app worked on wifi, but stopped working when they switched to their 4g data connection.  The issue was related to IPv6, which their 4g connection was trying to use.    I believe I had the records set correctly in Route 53 - I had two records for the name, one A and one AAAA, both were set to be an alias and both had the alias target pointing to the A record displayed in the management console for my ELB.  This was working in the past, but I don't know if their 4g data connections were using IPv6 in the past.  As a temporary fix, I removed the AAAA record and now those users are able to use the app on 4g with no issues.  Were the dns records set correctly?  Could ipv6 have been broken for this elb?  Thanks Keith"
59244,Amazon EC2 V0,You didn't specify the name of the ELB which makes this hard to test.  You might have one of your impacted users try to visit http://test-ipv6.com/ to see if their IPv6 connectivity is working; it is possible that their provider isn't connected properly. You might also use http://ipv6-test.com/validate.php to see if your ELB is generally IPv6 reachable.
59244,Amazon EC2 V0,"The ELB is MappingELB-1399025252.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com.    If I enter the ipv6 or dualstack name of the elb into the ipv6 website test link you supplied, it is successful.  I just created several new records in route 53.  ipv6test.fishidy.com is a AAAA alias that points to the ELB above.    ipv6test2.fishidy.com has an A and an AAAA alias that both point to the ELB above.

59242,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello  Thanks for contacting AWS  You did not include the instance ID for me to check.. but looking at what you've mentioned, I would assume that the instance is about a year old which means you would have used an older AMI when launching the instance.

For example, if you specify a device name of /dev/sdh, your device may be renamed /dev/xvdh or /dev/hdh by the kernel; in some cases, even the trailing letter may also change (where /dev/sda could become /dev/xvde). Amazon Linux AMIs create a symbolic link from the renamed device path to the name you specify, but other AMIs may behave differently.  http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/block-device-mapping-concepts.html  Unfortunately, I was unable to pull up your AWS account associated with the forums account.

What you would want to do in this situation to block unwanted traffic from a certain IP address (179.111.139.23 for example) would be to alter the firewall/s on your back end webservers placed behind the ELB.  For example if you are running Linux, you could issue this command to drop any unwanted traffic from hitting your back end instances:  $ sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 179.111.139.23/32 -j DROP  Regards,  Troy W"
59237,Amazon EC2 V0,"Adding an iptables rule will not help if the traffic is transiting an ELB, as the 'packet source' is the ELB not the original client. iptables only helps if the IP is hitting you directly, in which case a security group change could block it as well.  Instead you'll need to have your webserver / application inspect the X-Forwarded-For header sent by the ELB for that IP and block the request based on it."

A single instance can certainly run 256 processes, but of course they won't all run concurrently.  256 m1.small's can run 256 processes concurrently, but the processes won't be able to share memory space.  How would you solve this aside from Cloud? Does your process require a a machine w/256 CPUs in it, or can you run it on a rack of commodity machines? What sort of interconnect-speed do you need?  Cloud services are not ideal for processes that require exotic hardware. They fit much better with something that can be scaled horizontally across more mundane instances."

The thing is: we have a Java application server (JBoss) and a PostgreSQL database running on some m1.large instances and one c1.xlarge instance. Sometimes, the application responds for a complicated request in 19s, sometimes even 9s, but, there are times that it takes more than 4 minutes! This variation isn't caused by many users connected, as we run it with no users or extra jobs, the machine is IDLE! From observation, we saw that sometimes you make a request and the CPU goes 100% (through htop) and the 0% and the page responds. That's the times we get the response in 9-19s. BUT, sometimes, you make SAME request, CPUs still are at 0% and then takes too much time till it hit 70, 80% and then responds, in about 4 minutes delay.  So, my question is: what may cause this delay for the CPU to react to the request? We saw that EBS is a damn moody thing, but, nothing like a variation from 9s to 4m, it's just unacceptable!

59216,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi,  I think you have to check that your server is NOT listening on the localhost IP (127.0.0.1) or any local IP. The easiest is to set the web server to listen an all its network interface (0.0.0.0).  You can check this by sshing on the server and issuing the following command: netstat -lntp | grep -E 'apache|httpd'  A correct output looks like: tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:80              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1158/apache2 tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:443             0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1158/apache2  Change the grep expression according to your web server.

Unfortunately there is going to be no easy way to do this if NFS is not an option. The reason for this is you would either need one of these systems or another system to provide a common storage area that both systems can access, this would generally be achieved using NFS.  I do not believe it will be possible without using NFS to achieve this within the AWS environment.

Instance0 was initially created directly from Amazon AMI in regular non-VPC EC2 but then I needed to move it to VPC, so I took a snapshot and started a new instance in VPC.  Instance2 was created in VPC directly from Amazon AMI.  On Instance1 I recently received a notification that Windows needs to be activated.

59205,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi,  When Activating using KMS Servers, Windows is only activated to a max of 180 days.  VPC and Classic instances activate against different KMS servers, which is why your Classic instance is having difficulty communicating. Once activation gets closer to 60 days remaining (which indicates an issue connecting to the KMS), EC2Config will again rerun the Activation plugin to automatically find and activate against the correct Server so that your instance remains activated.  Since you are already running on the version of Ec2Config which supports this, there should be no action needed on your part (As long as the Ec2Config service is running). Looking through the Ec2Config log will verify this behavior.  Regards,"

You should use the same password as on the original instances from which the AMIs were created.

Save this setting change.

59199,Amazon EC2 V0,"Getting all 20 cores on a C3 machine? The C3 hardware is a 20 core Ivy Bridge system, so 40 vCPU. However it looks like the largest instance offered is c3.8xlarge, which gives you 'only' 32vCPU, so 80% of a full machine. Is there any option to get the whole box so we can avoid possible noisy neigbors? That would be an interesting option for us since we have an app that we know runs well on a full 20 core system, but cares about affinity and core usage and would like to know it has the machine to itself.  It is great to have full disclosure of the underlying hardware, so we can tune before deployment. Going the next step to letting us get a full dedicated machine would be even better.  Thanks Martin"
59199,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi Martin,  When you run a C3 instance with a HVM AMI the core topology information is available to the operating system. If your app knows how to use CPUID to get the topology information or how to access this information from the operating system (for example, via /proc/cpuinfo or /sys/devices/system/cpu/* under Linux) then it can optimize its execution on the resources available to your instance.  You should see very consistent performance when running on c3.8xlarge instances. If you have concerns that are addressed by having a physical server that is dedicated to you on smaller instances sizes, you could investigate the Amazon EC2 Dedicated Instances. But again, it is very unlikely that a performance problem on c3.8xlarge could be caused by a ""noisy neighbor.""  Kind regards,  Matt"

All three instances are listed as healthy / in-service.   For the past few days, we've noticed that the ELB occasionally (every hour or so) stops forwarding requests to any of the registered instances for 20-30 seconds, according to the raw web server logs on these instances. During these concurrences, the only requests received by the registered instances are health check pings, all of which return successfully without timing out.  The ELB seems to be queuing incoming requests during this time, which it eventually forwards to the registered instances after a significant delay. We've traced several of these requests from HTTP client to web server. The web server receives the request ~20 seconds after it is issued from the client and returns a success response within 100ms, however the response time as measured on the client is ~20 seconds.  We're pretty sure this isn't caused by a problem on our instances, because it affects all of them at the same time. We've setup a CloudWatch alarm on the ELB for unhealthy host count >= 1 to determine whether the ELB is removing the instances from rotation, but it has not triggered.  Any ideas about what might cause this to happen? I'm not sure how to resolve this.

We have made a change on the load balancer that may help, but I would also suggest taking a look at adding more back end instances to the load balancer. This might help to mitigate the cpu/network spikes.   We are also seeing some 5XX timeout errors. This can be caused by large uploads or slow replies to the requests. We could look at adjusting that timeout if you are still seeing these errors.   Thank you,  Chris"
59195,Amazon EC2 V0,"Thanks for investigating this. Whatever change you made seems to have helped, because we haven't observed another occurrence of this issue since. Would it be possible to give us any details on the change that was made? That might be useful for future reference in case this ever happens again.  We stopped/started the instance that was running on the underlying host with possible issues, just in case. Also, we will look into reducing the traffic spikes and/or adding more back end instances, but this particular issue didn't seem to be correlated with traffic spikes.  By ""5XX timeout errors"", are you referring to errors originating from the ELB itself (i.e. ""HTTPCode_ELB_5XX"" CloudWatch metric) or from our back end instances? If the former, then it would probably make sense to increase the timeout to the largest possible value, because we do receive fairly large upload requests from slow clients (mobile).  Thanks, Matt"
59195,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  Thank You for responding back to the forum post.    Firstly, as the previous support engineer mentioned we have observed significant traffic spikes which were causing some issues on both the backend instances and the load balancer itself. We have scaled your load balancer to handle this significant traffic requests.    Secondly, thank you for stop/starting the instance that was lying under a bad hardware and looking into reducing traffic spikes and/or adding more backend instances.    Lastly, the ""5XX timeout errors"" are referred to errors originating from the ELB. This might be because of the large upload requests you have mentioned. Currently your elb has the default timeout set to : 60 seconds. I have increased this timeout to 15 minutes.   Please note that the backend timeout must be larger than ELB timeout.   Thanks, Sneha"
59195,Amazon EC2 V0,"I'm resurrecting this thread, because the issue has started occurring again. The ELB stops sending any requests other than the health check ping to any of the registered instances for around 20 seconds.   The most recent time this happened (today), I looked at the ELB status in the AWS console and it listed all instances as unhealthy and out of service, with the message ""A transient error occurred. Please try again later."" I could not find anything wrong with any of the registered instances at the time. I remained connected to each of them and confirmed that they weren't overloaded or returning errors. There wasn't any sort of traffic spike at the time either.  Could someone look into the status of our ELB instance? Would it be better for us to open a support ticket instead? We have an upcoming launch and this behavior from our ELB is going to cause problems.  Thanks, Matt"
59195,Amazon EC2 V0,The problem is reoccurring.
59194,Amazon EC2 V0,"Instance snapshot/image? So I am playing around with AWS EC2 and looking into it for a potential use as a software testing platform.  I have so far been a little unclear on something, if it is possible and/or how to do it.  I need to be able to run Windows Server 2008 R2, with SQL Server 2008 R2 Development Edition installed. I need to be able to test with the Enterprise features that are not available in SQL Server Standard or Web editions, so using the standard images doesn't seem to be an option even if the price wasn't a consideration.  If I install it on a Windows Server 2008 R2 Base system, is there a way to save an image or snapshot so that I can terminate the instance, and then later recreate it with the software already installed? Or is that something I would have to do myself whenever a new instance is started?  Edited by: Gerald Fishel on Jan 28, 2014 2:06 PM"
59194,Amazon EC2 V0,"So I was able to figure out how to do it. It was pretty straightforward. Sorry for the clutter   To answer my own question, you just have to right-click the instance in the manager, and do a Create Image, which will save the snapshot and create the image. Then from the AMIs page, you right-click the image and select Launch, then you can setup the instance to be created from that image.  Edited by: Gerald Fishel on Jan 28, 2014 3:28 PM"

59192,Amazon EC2 V0,"EC2 instance unable to contact the internet Hello everyone, I seem to have bumped into a weird issue with an EC2 instance (i-be7794d4). It still does networking nice and proper, inbound works fine, but outbound to the internet is failing. Outbound to devices on the same VPC seem ok.

59187,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi,  The ami-fb795792 has default block mappings for ephemeral0 and ephemeral1, but when launching M3 instances we ignore any instance store volumes specified in the block device mapping for the AMI. See http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/block-device-mapping-concepts.html#ami-block-device-mapping for more details  The block mappings must be specified at launch time, though how this is achieved will depend on how you are launching the instances:  if using the ec2 cli tools then the mappings are specified via --block-device-mappings as per http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.html if using the API directly then see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/ApiReference-query-RunInstances.html for the details.

59180,Amazon EC2 V0,Hi Chris ...Thanks for the explaination
59180,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi Chris  unfortunately this still has not answered my question.  Essentially, I want to create an EC2 Instance with an Ubuntu Server operating system, and configure this to run a number of web and server applications (e.g. Apache, Webmin etc)  However, as soon as I ""stop"" and ""start"" the instance, I seem to lose all my configuration. (For example, with my i-2d11af61 instance)  I understand that for data such as file storage etc, I can just mount an external EBS volume, and this works fine.  But, how can I create a server instance that can withstand a stop and start (not terminate). Can you briefly outline the steps, as I cannot see where I can ""Swap"" the default EBS volume and its contents (the Operating system and configuration) with a new, persistent EBS volume.  Your help is very much appreciated here."
59180,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello  I had a look at the instance mentioned (i-2d11af61) and noted that while the root volume (/dev/sda1) was an EBS volume, you also had an instance store volume (or ephemeral volume) attached (/dev/sdb). It is important to note that data stored on instance store volumes is not persistent. In other words, if you stop start your instance, that data will be gone forever. Data stored on EBS volumes, however, will persist even after a stop/start of your instance.  If you would like the data to persist through a stop start, you will need to attach an additional EBS volume. Please see the following docs for more information on storage options and also instructions on creating and attaching EBS volumes to your instances:  http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AmazonEBS.html http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumes.html http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-attaching-volume.html  Regards, Monique B"

(Note: Assigning Spot requests to a Launch Group may reduce the chance that they can be fulfilled.) ""  - http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot-instances/  I have been testing this and noticed that:  the 2 x ec2 instances I tested with were launched within a second of each other from the timestamps so assuming the launching is working correctly. when I manually terminated one of the instances that was spawned from the request, the other ec2 instance was not terminated.   Is this a bug or am I misinterpreting the definition?  Please note that I made sure to check on the website frontend that the API request succeeded in setting launch group for these instances.

The 'terminates simultaneously' was in reference to if perhaps one Spot Instance exceeds the bid, it will terminate through normal processes, therefore triggering the entire group to terminate as well.  Regards,  Howard K"
59176,Amazon EC2 V0,"First of all, thank you for taking the time to clarify this matter for me. I had a feeling this might be the situation, hence why I had put in bold text ""when I manually terminated..."" Followed by: ""...am I misinterpreting the definition?""  It seems to me that it might be a good idea to ealaborate the definition on this page  to prevent confusion with other customers in the future as it makes no mention of this clause.  Being able to group instances such that they all spin-up and terminate together, regardless of how they are terminated, would be great, not just for spot instances, but for on-demand instances as well. In the meantime I will just have to ensure that my monitoring processes to do this for me through requests.  Thanks again.  Regards, Stuart  Edited by: programster on Jan 27, 2014 12:36 PM"

59162,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  I had a look at your instances and I do not see a specific security group that allows port 9200, and I do not see any instances under your account with the name kibana, nor any EC2 instances with Public IPs of 54.198 in the first two octets.   In order to better understand what you are trying to accomplish, can you list the id's of your instance and what ports you require on each one so that we may provide guidance on how to open these to each other?  You can also restrict your ports on the security group to specific IP address of your server that is initiating the connection, so that you do not need to have them open to 0.0.0.0/0. Please have a look at the following documentation:  http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html#adding-security-group-rule  Best regards,  Bryan"

All the five server having the our different different client so all the server having the differener domain name and IP address.  How would I maintain the fix IP and domain with amazon ??  2.  I want to load balancing for the servers so every client would have the good speed. so how I achieve the same with 5 servers with minimizing the cost ???  3.

59151,Amazon EC2 V0,"A clock running inside of a virtual machine is subject to quite a bit of skew.  So, in the same way that you check your watch against the wall clock, your virtual server checks against the clock provided by the Amazon server you're running on.  Your server found that the virtual machine clock was different, and so it changed that clock to match.  If you let your clock get too far off, it may cause problems with some protocols, so it is a good idea to let clock syncs occur.  However, this style of timekeeping is error prone -- the hardware clock is only accurate to 1s -- and wild swings in time are bad for some processes.  If you are very sensitive to time, you may want to run some form of NTP on your machine.  NTP keeps an eye on a number of atomic clocks, and gently adjusts your clock to match. We have some documents on ntp, but they only mention Linux."

59146,Amazon EC2 V0,Thanks for your reply. If I upgrade the instance by folllowing 1) Stop the instance 2) Change instance type 3) run the instance  All files such as database in my server will still remain?  Or can you suggest what is the best way to upgrade an instance?
59146,Amazon EC2 V0,"That is correct,   All the data on the volumes will be persistent.  Please make sure that when you stop / start the instance the dns name and the system ip will change, If you are using the elastic ip address you will have to re-associate the ip back to the instance.  If it is a system ip this ip will be lost.  Regards, Baseer."

59144,Amazon EC2 V0,"VPC or Security Group Issues in North Virginia? I've tried to launch multiple spot instances of type: cc2.8xlarge into the North Virginia Region. I've tried us-east-1b, us-east-1c and us-east-1d. The instances all start correctly, using the Ubuntu 13.10 HVM AMI: ubuntu-saucy-13.10-amd64-server-20131015 (ami-a1184ac8).  I have a security group setup with a rule to allow SSH from any port. I had originally narrowed it to my IP addresses, but wanted to open it up to eliminate this as a possible issue.  I cannot connect via SSH. I'm receiving a connection timeout message.  I've followed this guide: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstancesConnecting.html  My keys have not changed, and I can connect to all of my instances in Oregon and all of my instances in my single account that launched into EC2-Classic.  I tried then opening up the rule even further (allow all ports from all IPs) and I can't ping ports that are known active in Ubuntu.  This behavior is exhibited in multiple accounts. All of the accounts that are having this problem are launching spot instances into a VPC. I have a single account that launches into EC2-Classic, and I'm able to create instances in the North Virginia regions listed above and can access without issue.  Given that the issue spans accounts and that it started today, I'd really like some pointers on how to go about diagnosing why I can't connect. It seems as though the changes I'm making to security groups are simply being ignored."
59144,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  I have tried to investigate this issue for you including the same region and using the same AMI to provision a new cc2.8xlarge instance and using the same userid of 'ubuntu' was able to successfully log into the instance.  I did note a difference of the security groups between us-east-1 and us-west-2, that being the address starting with 67.x.x.x/32 not in place for ssh and the other service. Can you please update your security group of ""boinc-client"" in us-east-1 adding the same rules as per the security group of ""sg-69b7a40b"" in us-west-2 and advise us of the outcome. Everything else that I can see from my initial investigation looks perfectly okay.  If this does not resolve the issue can you please reply including the Instance ID that is failing and another where it is working correctly.  Best Regards,  Davin G."

I can now (from my home address) once again access instances created in the Amazon North Virginia VPC. I'm really not sure what happened, and nothing change on my end: security groups, router, firewall, etc.  I'm beginning to think that Comcast could have had an issue somewhere in the backbone between my home IP address and Amazon.

59139,Amazon EC2 V0,"M3 Instance Questions 1. M3 Large has a free 32GB SSD drive. If I restore my old AMI image, increase the D: drive size from 20GB to 32GB SSD with 960 IOPS, does this fall into the free 32GB SSD zone, or will I be billed separately for it?  2. When  launching  one of my AMI's (containing Windows 2003) I don't have all the instance options for it. The best performing instance is c1.medium. How can I launch it as a M3 instance instead?"
59139,Amazon EC2 V0,"EBS (standard or provisioned IOPS) and instance storage (standard disks or SSD) are completely different things. You will always be charged for any EBS usage separately. Instance storage included with the instance needs to be configured in the instance launch wizard. Keep in mind that instance storage is ephemeral. EBS is a better place for data that you care about.  Regarding the Windows AMI, it sounds like that might be a 32-bit AMI, which is supported by a few instance types only."

59138,Amazon EC2 V0,"Automating Replication of EC2 Instance into Larger EC2 Instance... Have a tiny ec2 instance with tons of user directories, when the resources of instance are getting full would like to replicate the tiny instance/ including directories onto larger instance (small, medium, large).    Is this something that can be done using elastic beanstalk? This all needs to be automated...   Thanks in advance! Diego"
59138,Amazon EC2 V0,"So when your tiny instance reaches some limit, you basically want to have it upgraded to something better? That is certainly possible, but I'm not sure if I would be comfortable with automating it.  If you start out with a plain EC2 instance, say, the really tiny t1.micro, you can upgrade it to another type by selecting your instance in the Management Console, Stop it, Change Instance Type, and then Start it back up again. You'll find these commands in the Actions menu. Storage can also be expanded, but that process is a bit more complicated. Please see Expanding the Storage Space of a Volume. You can always create and attach additional volumes instead of modifying the existing one.  As AWS offers APIs for all of their services, it is possible to automate these things. Extending the file system after expanding a volume is done inside the instance, but things like that can be scripted as well. These actions will require some downtime, so it will be affecting your users. As these are quite sensitive operations, it might be better to set up alarms to get a notification when you approach a limit and then upgrade manually. Scaling up and down frequently might not be a very good idea in this particular case. As far as I  understand, a single instance is acting as primary storage for all data. That is unfortunately not a good fit for Elastic Beanstalk and perhaps not a manual Auto Scaling setup either (which relies on scaling out to multiple instances)."

Does the instance have a static IP configured, or is it obtaining its IP and route information via DHCP?  There are two things that you can try at this point.  1) You can attempt to add another ENI to this instance as this may provide the needed route and restore connectivity.  The document below goes into more detail on ENIs:  http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html#create_eni  2) If an t1.micro instance works, you can attempt to upgrade to the latest version of the EC2Config service.  After upgrading this service, you can attempt to switch to an m1.medium.  The document below describes how to update this service:  http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/UsingConfig_WinAMI.html#UsingConfig_Install  Please let us know if you have any questions.

It is important to note, if this is due to something internal to an instance we have limited visibility. In this case however, I am seeing a temporal issue on the underlying hardware where your Instance resides which resulted in the reboots.  If you wish, you may choose to move to alternative underlying hardware by issuing a Stop/Start. Note however, Instance store volumes do not persist through a Stop/Start.  Regards, Coenraad"

59121,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi,  As previously discussed, AMI copy, Snapshot copy, and Copying between S3 buckets is limited in the Govcloud region.   However, should you need to move data, and you have considered the risks and compliance, you can create an image from your Volume/s depending on what Operating System you are using, you can either use DD, or Rsync for linux, or a more conventional cloning application for Windows.  You can then choose to store it in S3, from where there are tools available to move the data locally, and upload it again into another region, please be mindful of security and compliance bodies.

59116,Amazon EC2 V0,"I too believe I am being plagued by this, but for a few days now. I have narrowed my tests down to this:   Windows + IIS EC2 instance inside a VPC with a public IP mapped to it and 80/443 open. Single file approximately 5-10 megs (.zip) on the root of a simply configured website. I've coded a command line app to download the file repeatedly with varying numbers of threads.    In tests of this simplified setup (ruling out a browser or more complex IIS setups like MVC/ASP.NET, streaming file bytes from a database, etc.) - and from multiple outside network locations, types and machines. They all demonstrate inconsistent and interruptive network behavior.   Sometimes the file will download completely, and even dozens and dozens of times in a row across 1 or many threads - no problem.  Randomly, other runs, the file download goes far slower, gets to 100k-500k, then the connection is interrupted. The .NET ""WebClient"" class my command line test tool utilizes reports that remote server has closed the connection unexpectedly. The EC2 IIS logs show that only a few of the bytes were sent out.   Nothing changes between consecutive runs and this is a relatively small number of variables. IIS, zipped file, automated download with WebClient in C#, and it's just all over the place. Hundreds in a row fine, then dozens in a row interrupted. Doesn't matter if I use 1 thread with long delays, or 10 threads hammering away.    Final point: If I run all the same tests, repeatedly, in any number of threads - but download from the same EC2 instance using its private IP (from inside the VPC), I have yet to ever have any issues. So I feel this pushes the issue to the area of the IP/security group/VPC intermittency.    Amazon underlying hardware / NIC / VPC issue?  Edited by: tadeveloper on Jan 23, 2014 11:26 AM"

59113,Amazon EC2 V0,"New instances are now defaulting to 1024 GB of storage I am having a problem similar to the one described in this thread: https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=509647&#509647  New instances based on an AMI I use are now defaulting to 1024 GB of ebs storage when previously they used to default to 8 GB for me. In the thread linked above Mike P noted that if an AMI is missing the default volume size it now defaults to 1024 GB. I never had this issue until recently, and it resulted in over $100 in extra charges in one week.  I think the interface for creating new instances needs to be improved, as the storage size isn't even shown unless you specifically look for it. It didn't occur to me the default would change overnight. The new default value increases the cost of a micro instance by almost 10x in a month.   I'm not sure if you all give credits to new customers that have issues like this, but if so that would be great."
59113,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  Thank You for posting this on the forums. Could you please provide us the instance id in question.  As per the last update, I see that the issue was confirmed to be fixed by the engineering team. Based on the information from your side, I can investigate this further.  Thanks, Sneha"
59113,Amazon EC2 V0,"Sneha,  Thanks for your response. I terminated all 4 of the instances in question as they were costing way more than intended. I was expecting the storage for the four instances to cost about $2 for the week, and instead was billed over $100.   Is there any way for me to view a log of instances I have terminated? I took quick look and could not find anything. All of them were in the Norther California region, and were the only instances I had in that region this month.  The default value is still 1024 GB for new instances I create in most regions. The region where the AMI was copied from still defaults to the old value, but all the other regions I copied the instance to now default to 1024 GB when I create the instance. Now that I know I have to change the storage size when creating an instance it's not as much of a problem, but it came as a bit of a surprise as the default has been different for several months, and the storage size isn't even shown by default when creating an instance."
59113,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  Thank you for providing further information. I apologize for the issues you are facing.  As my colleague had stated this was a known issue that should be fixed. Based on the date of the AMI, I believe it may be helpful to attempt to copy a new version of the original (working) AMI to the region.   Can you please attempt to re-copy the original AMI to the external regions and then test a new instance launch?  Best regards,  Chris G."
59113,Amazon EC2 V0,"Chris,  I coped the original AMI again and the default value is now correct on new instances. I still think it is a little odd that the AMI I copied six months ago all of a sudden had a new default value for the storage that was 128 times the old value.  Thanks for your response.  David"

59107,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi!  It looks like your kernel commandline became corrupted somehow, so that it says root= instead of root=LABEL=/. The script that updates the grub configuration when you install a new kernel update is called new-kernel-pkg, and it looks like it reads the root line from your fstab entry for /. Did you make any changes to /etc/fstab, or /boot/grub/menu.lst?  As to how to recover, you could do something like this:  stop the instance detach the root volume attach it to a running instance in the same availability zone mount the filesystem there edit /boot/grub/menu.lst (and /etc/fstab) on that filesystem to correct the error unmount detach reattach to the stopped instance run the stopped instance   If you want to report the contents of fstab and menu.lst here so we can diagnose the issue, that could be helpful.  If you need more help with it, it's often helpful to provide instance IDs so that someone in AWS can take a look at the state it's in.  I hope that's helpful, and we look forward to fixing the bug, once we can identify the root cause.  Best Regards, Andrew"

59092,Amazon EC2 V0,"difficulty accessing newly launched instances -- new behavior today Y'all:  I'm having difficulty reaching some of my hosts from my home machine, though I've double-checked that it seems to be listed correctly in the relevant security groups. Some specifics:  Instance i-cc67bac5 was launched earlier today. Its SG lists my home address (one of the /32 addresses, ends in .156) for access on port 22, and I am able to reach some of our other hosts whose SGs include the same entry from here. I can reach this host by SSHing to one of the machines in our office and hopping from there, but I cannot find a good explanation as to why I cannot get there directly.  Instance i-7db96674 seems to be in a similar state. I launched this through our provisioning system a few hours ago, and my system has been trying since then to get through and launch the bootstrapper, but it hasn't got through. Because of that, I don't have a way to reach this instance at all, so my troubleshooting ability is limited on that box, but I'll leave it up for the time being.  I haven't found any problems with our other hosts, and at least one example suggests my problem is not with the SG. My instance i-cbb148fc is in the same SG with i-7db96674, and I can reach it just fine.  Peers: I'd love to hear about anybody else having troubles with newly launched instances.

59092,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  Thank you for using the AWS Forums today. If I understand your post correctly, you are able to access these instances from other locations, just not your home IP address? I do see that you have the rule in your security group for the IP that ends in xxx.156.   One test that you can attempt is to try and open a telnet session over port 22. This will allow you to confirm that you are able to access the instance over that port. You can do this from any Windows/Linux OS.   You will need to run a command similar to:  telnet <IP ADDRESS OF INSTNACE> 22   This will try and open a connecting to that IP over that port. Try some of the other ports that are aloud in your security group as well.  Also, can you verify that your IP is still correct? If you are trying to connect from home and your WAN IP address has change it could potentially cause problems.   I hope this helps!  -AdamC"
59092,Amazon EC2 V0,"Adam:  Thanks! Good thought, but I'm way ahead of you on that. Specifically, here's what I have done to confirm packets are really not getting through:  1) Perform an indirect SSH connection to the instance (in this case i-cc67bac5) through our office as I noted. Use ec2metadata to get the for-real current public IP of the instance.  2) In that session I run a packet capture to see all activity on port 22 (and then grep out the traffic coming from my machine in the office) -- something like:     sudo tcpdump -i2 tcp port 22 | grep -v 12.34.56.78.ptr.ofc.isp.net  3) While that is running, I try both ""ssh my.inst.ip.addr"" and ""telnet my.inst.ip.addr 22"". In neither case do I see any activity in the tcpdump session.  And yes, I did confirm that my home IP address is the same. And that I can still access all my instances launched before yesterday.  Any other guidance about what to check?  E.  Edited by: VM_Eric_S on Jan 8, 2014 10:03 AM"

59092,Amazon EC2 V0,"Marcin:  Thanks for that. I've just added your address for access to port 22 on both of the affected instances I've been studying. Those are i-cc67bac5 and i-7db96674, on 54.184.8.100 and 54.184.62.124 respectively.

Also, I have launched one more fresh instance this morning, and it is working fine so far. So it's possible this problem was caused by a temporary condition affecting only new instances during a period yesterday, or perhaps that it affects only instances on a particular host system or group of host systems.

59092,Amazon EC2 V0,"Update: My hope that the problem would not recur today has been dashed. I was just launching another instance and I'm seeing the same thing.  Marcin, I've added TCP port 22 from your IP to the relevant security group. This instance is i-755c827c, at 54.184.61.189.  Thankx,  E."
59092,Amazon EC2 V0,"Further Update:  This may or may not be relevant, but I've noticed the instance I launched yesterday is in a different public IP range than the ones that are failing. My failing IP addresses are: 54.184.8.100, 54.184.62.124, and 54.184.61.189  ...and my successful recently launched server is at 54.214.193.51.

Ahh, I see according to https://forums.aws.amazon.com/ann.jspa?annID=1701 that this is the newly added address range for us-west-2. This makes me wonder whether somebody's got an outdated routing table or something?  Anyway, I would love to see what you can find out.  Thankx,  E."
59092,Amazon EC2 V0,"...and one more update:  Considering my last update, I've done a bit more digging. One of the theories I wasn't sure about was whether it's possible my ISP (again that's Comcast in this case) might be blocking port 22. But I just re-tested to confirm this isn't what's going on. Specifically, I did the same process as I noted earlier in the thread -- get to one of the hosts through an intermediate box, run tcpdump to capture on a particular port, and try connections from different places.  This time I did that test with port 80 on one of the affected instances. Instance i-755c827c is in a security group that allows worldwide access to port 80, and I was unable to get packets to port 80 from my home machine, but I was able to observe them in the tcpdump output when I connected from another network.  I think this definitely shows the problem is routing rather than filtering (or, I suppose, a really egregious filtering problem, but I doubt that). I imagine other AWS users' instances may also be inaccessible from Comcast users, at least in my area.  I can try to pursue this through Comcast as well, but I imagine your peering folks will be able to sort this out a lot faster than I can.  Thanks!  E.  P.S. I just reconfirmed the same problem on port 443 as well.  Edited by: VM_Eric_S on Jan 8, 2014 2:00 PM"
59092,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello Eric,  I tested all the three instances from my end and they all respond on port 22. Please go ahead and remove my IP address from your security group.  I am not 100% sure if the issue resides at Comcast side. Can you try to run tcp based trace-route to these instances from the failing network (your home, on Comcast) and provide we with the results?  If your local (home) computer is unix based you can simply run the following:  traceroute -T -p 22 your ec2 ip address  for example: traceroute -T -p 22 50.50.50.50  If your local (home) computer is windows based you can download tcp based traceroute from here: http://tracetcp.sourceforge.net/  Also, can you ensure that your local firewall for example: router, or the firewall on you local computer is not filtering incoming traffic?

59092,Amazon EC2 V0,"I had the same issue just today. To work around it, I allocated an elastic IP and associated it with my instance. Luckily, it came up with one which wasn't in the same problematic IP range."
59092,Amazon EC2 V0,"Emily -- thanks for that thought; it's a good idea.  Sadly, it won't easily solve my own problem, because I'm needing to proceed on a project where I terminate and relaunch two categories of instances, about 12 or 15 in all. But I would recommend that step for anyone else being affected by this issue who has only a small number of affected instances.  My bigger concern is how this could affect other users on troublesome Comcast networks. If this weren't affecting me, I would have no idea about a problem that could keep a whole category of users from potentially reaching our site (if I ended up with problematic addresses on new front-end servers).  E."
59092,Amazon EC2 V0,"For anyone who's still checking into this, the problem is still persisting today. I have shut down a couple of my experimental instances, but I have kept one running (i-755c827c). This instance's security group allows access on port 80 and 443 from anywhere, so it's a good test case. Nothing is running there because I don't have the tools in place to get it configured, but I can get to it manually and run tcpdump to confirm whether traffic gets through.  Thankx,  E."
59092,Amazon EC2 V0,"Marcin or whoever:  I've just verified that this problem is still occurring. In every case I have examined, traffic from Comcast to the newest block of public addresses in us-west-2 is failing to get to its destination. I'm running instance i-755c827c on 54.184.61.189 for troubleshooting, and it's still failing this morning.  Is there any word on whether this has been referred to the network folks who can work with Comcast to sort it out?  E."
59092,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello E.   Marcin is not in today.  I have engaged our EC2 networking team as the tests you have run so far indicate the issue is a route path selection based on source/destination IP. If you have a chance I would be very interested in a tcpdump on instance i-755c827c to see if port 80 or port 443 are also effected. Additionally I'd also like to verify that an EIP will work. I am fairly certain this is an issue with path selection, the two tests above will verify this. Thank you for the valuable feedback and your patience and understanding as our networking team works this.  Regards,   Mike P."
59092,Amazon EC2 V0,"Mike -- thanks for stepping in.  Running a tcpdump test as you request was one of my earlier steps. Specifically, here's what I did:    - On my current test instance for this question (i-755c827c at 54.184.61.89), ensure TCP ports 80 and 443 are allowed from 0.0.0.0/0.   - Open a session on the instance by connecting through an intermediate host.   - Run tcpdump on the instance with a command line like:  tcpdump -i2 port 443  (or 80 in the case of the second test)    - Perform a test connection from my intermediate host to confirm tcpdump is working, with:  telnet 54.184.61.89 443  (or 80 again)    - In the session on the instance, confirm tcpdump is showing the output.   - From my home machine (the one on a Comcast network), attempt same telnet test.   - HEY!  Okay, new result. Earlier this morning I still couldn't SSH to that host, but as of now I can. It may be Comcast (or whatever intermediary) has finally got it sorted.  I'll dig around and see whether I can confirm this is true throughout.  E."

59091,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  I have investigated this issue for you and can see it has now been shutdown.  I believe the issue you have encountered is due to a known Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SSH issue whereby if the instance is rebooted you are unable to now log into the instance via SSH. I have included details of this issue below:  Description: The problem seems to be cloud init does not understand newline characters. In the /etc/rc.local file, there are lines that add the following content to /etc/ssh/sshd_config file.  cat <<EOL >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config UseDNS no PermitRootLogin without-password  Due to this bug, these lines get added multiple times to the sshd_config file and this breaks sshd. To resolve this you need to comment out the lines in the /etc/rc.local file as well as remove the additional entries from the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file.  For the Bugzilla Report - https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=956531.  The general process for carrying this out is to shutdown the RHEL instance, detach the root volume, attach it to another Linux instance, mount the volume, edit those files then carry out the same process in reverse. At that stage you should then be able to successfully start your instance.  If you have any further questions please ask.  Best Regards,  Davin G."

59089,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  I have tried to investigate this issue for you however I have noted you have a large number of volumes attached to a variety of instances.  If you are creating volumes using Provisioned IOPS then these can take some time as each individual block needs to be formatted as part of the process to ensure performance. This is similar behaviour to formatting a new drive using the Windows Formatting Tools where you have the option of a quick vs slow format, when using Provisioned IOPS we are doing a similar process to the slow format option. Additionally the larger the volume when using Provisioned IOPS then the longer it will take to format before it is available.  Are you able to provide the specific Volume ID where this has occurred please?  Regards,  Davin G."

59087,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi,  I am seeing one Instance linked to your Forum account in US-West-2 which is a m1.large instance type.  Free tier usually encompasses the t1.micro instance type. I also see that you added a 420 GiB EBS volume to the instance.  On the M1.Large instance type, you get 2 x 420gb instance store volumes, depending on whether you map it on Instance startup.  That being said, it looks like you have terminated all your resources now. I have searched for volumes linked to your account for a couple of regions and could not find any that currently exist.  Can you confirm that you terminated all of them?  Regards, Coenraad"
59087,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi, Coenraad     I read the forum and found I was charged for the provisioned storage as long as I attached the storage to my instance, even these storage are not occupied. I terminated the two 420G storage attached to my instance to see if the charges still increase last night. This morning I found there is a slightly increase in the bill, from 30G last night to 35 G this morning. I want to wait till tonight to see if the charges increase or not.     I thought the 420G is included in the Reserved Instance and I don't need to pay extra for the storage, right? If not, how much storage is included for a reserved instance such as the m1.large? for the free tier, it's about 30G per month.   Thanks for your help"
59087,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  I think the confusion here is about the storage that is included with an instance.  Many of our instance types include a certain amount of ""Instance Storage"". This allows you to store temporary data on your instance, but it is not persistent; if your instance should stop for any reason at all (including a physical host failure) then that data will be lost and cannot be recovered.  For persistent data you should use EBS volumes. However, EBS volume space is chargeable and is not included free with your instance.  I hope this clarifies. If you need anything else please let me know.  Richard"
59087,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi, Richard,     If the ""Instance Storage"" is temporary, how can we save the data on it. Let's say I have 100G EBS attached to the instance m1.large which has 420G instance storage. 100G will be the space I see under my account, like using ""df"" command, right? Do I need to move the data to EBS? Or that will be done in the background. Can my running program use more than 100G disk space, like some temporary files? Thanks."
59087,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  The Instance Storage's block device and volume information is available when you run df, assuming the instance was launched with the default Instance Storage.  When the instance is launched with a root EBS volume, the operating system and your applications will reside on the root EBS volume.   To migrate data to the Instance Store volume, you'll explicitly need to copy/move the data there. When referring to the Instance Store volume as ""temporary"", this means the volume's contents will not persist through a stop/shutdown of the instance.  If the EBS volume is 100GB, you cannot use more than 100GB unless you expand the volume to a larger size.  Please review our documentation on Instance Store and EBS for more information:  http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AmazonEBS.html  Best regards,  Bryan"
59087,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi,  I still have a question about the EBS. I terminated all my EBS volume and created one volume for testing. In the create menu, I chose using the type as standard, size as 30G, snapshot as the test run with free trial. I didn't attach this volume to any instance but let it stay for two days. I found I was charged by some EBS cost, about 0.10 per day. I remember when I first create the free instance with 30G EBS for several days, there is no charge. It seems this snap free trial is not free without the free instance, right?  Thanks"
59087,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  Your free tier EBS storage is limited to a maximum of 30GB across your account. If you exceed this, or are not eligible for free tier, then you will be charged.  See here for more:  http://aws.amazon.com/free/  Richard"

We are also now unable to create an RDS snapshot (unknown error) so rebuilding the environment is not an option.  Please advise.
59085,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,   I took a look at your Elastic Load Balancer and I see that your instance behind it is failing health checks. It started constantly failing them about 13 hours ago.   I took a look at the instance itself and I see that it is limited to only allow port 80 connections from sg-c28f7ea7, so I cannot determine if port 80 is accepting connections.   I would suggest you log into the instance and see if your web server software is running correctly, and that the host is listening on port 80.   As far as the RDS snapshot, how are you starting the snapshot. I see the error ""The parameter DBSnapshotIdentifier is not a valid identifier"" returned from the attempted snapshot creation.   Thank you,  Chris"
59085,Amazon EC2 V0,"Thanks for the reply, Chris.  Since this is a business app (Rails), all incoming requests will redirect to a login page.  Should we set the health check URL to the root?

BTW we just added Developer Support to our account so perhaps we can get a closer look.  Thanks. for your time."

You can also set up a health check page to also help verify if your application / services are working properly before letting the ELB pass requests back to the instance. As you stated you have signed up for Developer Support, you can get direct assistance with any other ELB inquiries you may have and can address the RDS snapshot issue (if still present).

Is there any way our previous instance i-3265ed42 was backed up and we can restore it from it's last proper working version 2 days ago?  Thanks  Matt"
59082,Amazon EC2 V0,would disk space be a problem?
59082,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello Matt,  Unfortunately, we do not run backups for our customer. You can backup your ec2 servers by either creating snapshots or AMI.  If you have created snapshots or AMI you can recover from it by launching an ec2 (using your latest snapshot/AMI))  Major difference between an image and a snapshot is that an image is for the entire instance (including all the attached EBS volumes) whereas a snapshot is for a single EBS volume.  If you have multiple EBS volumes attached to an instance, usually AMI creates a perfect replica of it by attaching those volumes. When you create an image, you'll notice that it in fact is creating a snapshot. An image links these snapshots to create AMI that automatically mounts these snapshots as volumes when your instance is launched.  If you have multiple volumes attached to an instance (especially in some RAID configuration), an AMI is preferable because it mounts those volumes for you - eliminating an additional step.  If you have a single EBS volume or if you want to only backup individual data volume(s), you can create a snapshot without creating an image. In the event of a failure, you can simply detach the original volume and attach the new volume that you created from the backup snapshot in its place.  For single volume instances, I still suggest that you create an AMI when you're making major changes (such as installing/configuring applications). For daily backups, you can just create snapshots for each of the volumes.  When you're restoring, images are much easier than snapshots because for images, all you have to do is launch an instance from it. For snapshots, you have create an EBS volume, detach/attach it from a stopped instance. So there are additional steps required for snapshots.  Creating an Amazon EBS Snapshot http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-creating-snapshot.html#creating-snapshot-ebs-console  Creating Amazon EBS-Backed AMIs http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/creating-an-ami-ebs.html  Regards,  Marcin"
59082,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello Matt,  I understand that you have configured your wireless management software. Is there a way you can ssh to your ec2 server and make sure that all of your applications are running?  Perhaps there is a service that is not running, however, your application depends on, and is not launching because of that reason.  As previously asked did you run the following command locally:  curl -I https://54.235.176.182:8443 curl -I 54.235.176.182:8443  Regards,  Marcin"

59079,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi,  AS per our documentation http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AutoScaling/latest/APIReference/API_CreateAutoScalingGroup.html , the ID of the Amazon EC2 instance you want to use to create the Auto Scaling group.

However, data on instance store volumes is lost under the following circumstances:   Failure of an underlying drive Stopping an Amazon EBS-backed instance Terminating an instance   On the other hand, you can always log into the instance and take a backup of all the data stored on this instance store volume (attached on /dev/sdb)  Therefore, it is suggested that you do not rely on instance store volumes for valuable, long-term data.

Below is our documentation link that lists all Windows AMI available in each region:  https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search/results/ref=gtw_navgno_search_box?searchTerms=windows&search= http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/Using_WinAMI.html   To be able to RDP into a windows instance you will need to open port 3389 in your security group rules:  http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/EC2Win_GetStarted.html#EC2Win_LaunchInstance   To use a persistent IP, you can associated an Elastic IP address for your instance. The main advantage of using Elastic IP is even if you stop/start your instance, you can always re-associate the same Elastic IP back to your instance:  http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html   For more information on ec2 pricing in different regions, please visit:  http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/  You only pay for your instances that are running. Hence, you can always stop your instance if you are not using it. Once you start your instance you can re-associate the Elastic IP back to the instance.  Thanks, Sneha"
59075,Amazon EC2 V0,"How to identify EBS volume on windows instance? Hi,  I've seen another thread (https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=454280&#454280) with a similar question but had a few more questions on top of it.  For ex:  Say I have the following mapping on my windows machine Disk 1 - D: 100 GB Disk 2 - E: 100 GB Disk 3 - P: 100 GB Disk 4 - Q: 100 GB  And my block devices show as  xvdf xvdh xvdj xvdo  Can I assume Disk1 -> xvdf, Disk2 -> xvdh, Disk3 -> xvdj, Disk4 -> xvdo?  Really appreciate the help!  Thanks, Aneel"
59075,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  Thank you for posting this forum post. The forum thread you are referring too is correct.  1) If you haven't rebooted your Windows instance since you lasted mounted a volume, you will need to reboot your instance for this method of identification to work.  2) After reboot open command line (cmd) and type 'diskpart' and then 'list disk' . You should see something like this for example:  Disk 0 Online 30GB Disk 1 Online 100GB Disk 2 Online 15GB  3) This disk listing should correspond alphabetically with the mappings in the AWS console. For example:  Disk 0 ---> /dev/sda1 Disk 1 ---> xvdb Disk 2 ---> xvdc  ...and so on.  4) Identifying the storage size of the volume you're looking for may speed up this process (provided it has a unique storage size from other volumes).  In your case, it would be  Disk1 -> xvdf, Disk2 -> xvdh, Disk3 -> xvdj, Disk4 -> xvdo  Thanks, Sneha"

59073,Amazon EC2 V0,"EC2 Instance vanished Hi,  a few days back, I set up a micro EC2 instance to check your services so that I can decide whether or not I want to move my main projects to an amazon server. Yesterday in the morning, I tried logging in and found out that I couldn't connect to the instance via SSH, so I thought that the instance may have stopped running, but apparently the instance was simply gone, leaving behind only the elastic IP and the keys.  After checking with one of my coworkers, he had the connection opened the day before until later that afternoon, simply for monitoring, at which time he received the following message in his terminal:  Broadcast message from root@ip-172-31-32-201        (unknown) at 16:41 ...  The system is going down for reboot NOW! Control-Alt-Delete pressed   This was the second instance I have created for the purpose of testing your services, the first I had manually terminated.  I haven't opened a thread sooner, because i wanted to find whether this issue is something I could deal with manually.  After some searching, I have found more than a handful of cases with the same issue as mine and none of them have been resolved.  So, please answer me these simple Questions:  • Why did this happen? • Is there a way to restore the instance as it was? • Is there a way to secure the data? • Is there any guarantee that should I decide to move my main business to amazon servers I won't have to deal with the same problem?

59058,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  First, please allow me to apologize for the length of both the delay, and of the response.  It is somewhat odd that a client located in Columbus, Ohio is using Telia to get to an instance in us-east-1, unless the client is located somewhere in Europe.  Is the client located in Ohio?  Please clarify where these traceroutes are being sent from.  Additionally, the traceroutes don't seem to complete - they never actually make it to the instances in any of the cases shown.  In addition, you state that you cannot connect - what does a packet capture show?  Are you sending TCP SYN packets and not receiving a response?  Are you sure the security groups are configured properly?  Is this issue something brand new, or has connectivity never worked?  It would be interesting to see what happens when TCP is used over ICMP; could you please provide the output of a tcp traceroute?  If we can get some additional data, we may be better able to pin down the root issue here.  Best regards,  Benjamin R."

59058,Amazon EC2 V0,"There is always a problem with Telia. Always. Amazon doesn't actually care enough todo anything, and Time Warner, is well Time Warner. You can send all the mtr reports you want to Amazon they will just waste your time. Anyone in LA using TWC, which is pretty much everyone, always experiences problems with AWS services. Silly me thinking i could move my stuff to Oregon to get around the once a week 1000+ms, and horrid packet loss. Only to find out that Telia is now part of the Oregon AWS bgp route. Granted 200+ms latency, 50% packet loss, and bandwidth under 50kbps seems to be the norm for AWS in Los Angeles.  Heck last month when the latency was over 1Second, traceroutes were showing traffic being routed through Europe. It would seem TWC and AWS have no interest in this issue. Seeing as it effects every TWC So-Cal customer. I get complaints from everyone.... Hell even gamers complain about it, i tell them to lookup the IP, and do a quick traceroute (if possible). Suprise suprise, destination is an AWS Eip, routed through Telia, going to norcal. Best part of my morning was the chatter regarding people trying to watch Amazon's new streaming series, needless to say most (regretably) gave up, and probably sought out other content like Netflix. Yet thats silly as well, because Netflix streaming also goes on the fritz... Don't they use AWS aswell....  All in all it a big pile of horseshit. The Telia issue is ongoing nearly two years now. It gets worse every month. And everyone is getting told a bunch a bullshit! It is such a shame, because AWS is an amazing service. But this year has been incredibly difficult for anyone in Socal, who depends on AWS. Did i mention Telia is some foreign company with pretty much no possible way to be contacted.....Seeing as TWC, Netflix, Amazon, AWS, Apple, all tell me to talk to them. Or better yet lets all pay for some more service and waste more time sending MTRreport, traceroute, logs, etc etc... Obviously the netadmins at AWS dont notice the issue, NOT! They are probably the most vocal."
59058,Amazon EC2 V0,"Yes, problem is ongoing, gets worse every month. And TWC and AWS are feeding a bunch of crap to their customers. Don't be fooled by AWS comments, its an ongoing issue.... If someone at AWS says ""we will look into it"" it means one of two things, 1) You are being bullshitted. And 2) They are so low on the totem poll, all you will get is scripted lip-service.  This who Telia AWS TWC crap brings tears to my eyes."

If someone could explain what I am seeing I would appreciate it.    I have a NAT instance with its own security group.  I changed from the recommended rules to allow all Inbound traffic from the private subnet in the VPC.  The rule is basically ""All Port (Service) ALL from Source Internal Subnet""  This rule has been in place for a long time and we have not run into any issues.  Today we ran into a problem where it looked like the firewall was blocking a new service we were trying to setup on one of the servers in the Internal Subnet.  I added specifically that port from source Internal Subnet and this fixed the problem.  Is there something obvious I am missing?  Am I doing a decent job explaining the problem, or is further explanation needed?  Thank you."

59051,Amazon EC2 V0,"That was very helpful, thanks.  I am hoping to get a little further clarification.  The following page...  http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ri-modification-instancemove.html  says that...  To upgrade or upsize your reservation, you must have enough of the smaller instance types in the same reservation to consolidate into larger instance types  What does it mean by ""the same reservation""?    Does this mean that the two smaller reserved instances need to have been purchased at the exact same time so that they expire at the exact same time?  And, what happens if I have two smaller instances that expire at different times?  Can they be combined in some way, or is this not permitted?    Thanks!"
59051,Amazon EC2 V0,Could I please get some clarification from AWS on exactly what can and cannot be combined?  I understand that the instances need to be within the same family.  But are there other conditions... for instance regarding the end of the reservation?  Does it need to be exactly the same?    Thanks.
59051,Amazon EC2 V0,"The end date of the Reserved Instances that your are modifying should be the same, up to the hour. This means that the RIs should expire within the same hour.   Here are some points:  You can modify only the following attributes of your Reserved Instances: Availability Zone, Instance type, and network platform. (See http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ri-modifying.html) This means all the other attributes of your Reserved Instances--such as utilization type, tenancy, product--must match. (See http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ri-modifying.html#ri-modification)  The Reserved Instance must be of the same instance family, and the modification should result in the same footprint.

59046,Amazon EC2 V0,We have faced the issue again. Can you please help identifying the cause?
59046,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,   I took a look at the issue and have some more information about the situation.   The problem is that your auto-scaling group was not scaling on the right trigger to launch enough instances behind the load balancer to handle the amount of traffic. The auto-scaling group was looking for the CPU to hit a high threshold and it wasn't reaching those levels. Changing the trigger to Network-in or Network-out should allow the AS group to scale appropriately.   The reason why the auto-scaling group was not seeing the instances as unhealthy is that your health checks are set to EC2 and not ELB. With EC2 the auto-scaling group checks to see if the host is ""up"". And the hosts were up, they were just too busy to respond to the amount of requests on port 80. The ELB health checks test against a port 80, which was being overloaded and therefore failing the ELB health checks.   The long term fix for this issue would be to adjust the auto-scaling trigger to add more instances to the group as your network traffic increases.   Thank you,  Chris"

59044,Amazon EC2 V0,"Further investigation indicates that this is related to DNS lookups. For each request the DNS is looked up which, at a certain point, will throttle the requests.  We have tried making the same requests using the IP instad of the DNS name and get a lot better throughput on EC2. We've also tried using DNS Masq and enabled local DNS cache which also gave us a lot better results.  We will investigate this further to verify that this is in fact the root cause."

59034,Amazon EC2 V0,"Just as a quick suggestion, it is possible that it's a more general IP connectivity issue, which causes NS lookups to fail?  This could manifest itself in the errors you're experiencing as, when an app goes to request a server the first thing it needs to do is resolve the IP from the domain, which then fails because it can't communicate with the NS, so you get a DNS failure.  It would be interesting to keep a ping running on the box to another known ""good"" local box (maybe another one of your EC2 instances?) and see if that stops/fails at the same time as DNS. If so, it suggests a wider connectivity issue."
59034,Amazon EC2 V0,"That's a great idea. We're now running a continuous ping to an adjacent instance. This is currently an instant response, so it will be interesting to see how/if it is affected during the issue. We'll report back."
59034,Amazon EC2 V0,"Ok we have been running two pings, one to an another of our instances, and one to google.com  We have experienced the issue a couple of times, but there doesn't appear to be anything of note in the ping results.  Is it possible that when pinging google.com, that the IP is resolved initially and cached anyway?  If that is the case, surely our other resources are cached too, so why would they fail when the issue happens?"
59034,Amazon EC2 V0,"The ping test is ruling out connectivity, not DNS resolution. You are right, it performs the lookup once to get an IP then routinely pings the IP.  I was trying to ascertain whether the pings fail when NS resolution fails, suggesting it's purely an IP connectivity issue."
59034,Amazon EC2 V0,We increased the size of the instance from m1.medium to c3.large and this appears to have solved the issue.  Our average CPU has gone from 80% to 20%.  A server running at an average of 80% CPU load is still not 100%... so were Amazon deliberately limiting our network access to discourage this practise?

59033,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi cmc_tech,  I believe the issue you have encountered is due to a known bug in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux whereby the SSH configuration file is updated upon reboot which results in you no longer being able to log into it.  For further information regarding this please see the following Bugzilla Report - https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=956531.  The problem is that cloud init does not understand newline characters. In the /etc/rc.local file, there are lines that add the following content to /etc/ssh/sshd_config file.  cat <<EOL >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config UseDNS no PermitRootLogin without-password  Due to this bug, these lines get added multiple times to the sshd_config file and this breaks sshd. If you remove the additional line entries from the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file and comment out the 3 lines from the /etc/rc.local file this will resolve the issue permanently.  To do this you will need to shutdown the instance, detach the root volume, attach it to another instance, mount the volume internally, update those files then carry out this same procedure in reverse. Do remember to ensure the root volume is re-attached to the original volume as /dev/sda1. You should then be able to start your instance and log into it again.  Regards,  Davin G."

59031,Amazon EC2 V0,"Have I broken my ability to connect to my instance? Been messing around with EC2 to try and set up a site I've got elsewhere on AWS and I've been loving it. I'm currently on a micro instance. My last step was to set up a VPN using OpenVPN, and through this I think I configured it in such a way that it either stalled the computer or somehow blocked SSH. What happened was I was changing the configuration as per this tutorial: http://blogs.brandeis.edu/netsys/2013/04/16/openvpn-for-securing-traffic-between-aws-and-the-data-center-1-of-3/ and I finally managed to start it without errors and then all output to SSH stopped. I shut it and tried to reconnect and got nothing. Restarted the instance and still got nothing. Tried double checking my public DNS, my private key, all that. Nothing happens when I try and open the Java SSH on the AWS console. I started an instance of a new micro EC2 and I could SSH to that just fine (same security group).  I'm pretty sure that it is OpenVPN causing the problem, and as it's being run at startup there isn't much that I can do. Is there any way to go in and disable it without SSH? Accessing the filesystem directly? Or should I just cut my losses and start again with a brand new instance?"
59031,Amazon EC2 V0,"Well, assuming that you don't have a lot of work you would lose, cutting your losses is really quick...

They are mostly about how to fix your SSH keys, which I don't think is your problem, but the technique can still enable you to look around the disks of an instance that will no longer talk to you."

59028,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  Thank you for raising this. Having researched and tested the various CenTOS AMIs available within the AWS environment I have also been unable to identify an Instance Store based CenTOS 6.5 HVM based image.  In regards to creating either your own Instance Store based AMI or potentially converting your current AMI from PV to HVM I would recommend reading the following articles:  Creating an Instance Store-Backed Linux AMI - http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/creating-an-ami-instance-store.html  Making a Custom HVM Virtualized AMI for EC2 - http://www.likens.us/blog/2012/01/07/amazon-hvm-custom-ami-on-ec2/  If we can be of further assistance please ask.  Regards,  Davin G."
59028,Amazon EC2 V0,"Yes, I've built several instance store AMI's as it's a fairly easy process.  Unfortunately, there is no documentation on building a HVM instance store AMI, either from Amazon or otherwise.  The documentation you linked to for building an HVM instance is for an EBS AMI which is a different process.  If you notice, the writer is starting with a pre-existing AMI (presumably already EBS backed).  What I don't see in the AWS documentation on building an instance store AMI, is how to specify HVM vs. PVI.  This is specifically what I am trying to find.  I guess my exact question is:  how do I register an instance-store image as HVM vs. PVI?"
59028,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  You could launch our already created instance store HVM images and customize them.

59027,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,   Sorry to see that you still have issues with instance i-2f0d641b from the other forum post.   To answer your question with termination the instance will be deleted that includes any volume that is attached to the instance with 'Delete on Temination' flag enabled ( Usually root volumes are ). http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/terminating-instances.html  I noticed that while Network ACL and Route table are configured to allow outbound traffic, security group of the instance only allows port 80 outgoing.   It means that you won't be able to connect to any HTTPS url. As you have mentioned in the other post Windows update needs HTTPS , you can try the following test:  telnet www.google.com 80  And also allow port 443 outbound as well to see if that makes any difference.  You can also leave 'netstat -n 1' running to see what connections to what IP addresses are being made while testing.  Kind regards,  Mostafa S."

59020,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  Our ELB team has responded after taking a look at this situation.  Can you describe more about how your clients are accessing this ELB?  So far, we have been unable to tie this issue to a specific problem with the ELB  Instead, it looks like the clients dropped off right as load was picking up.  We came to this conclusion after looking at the request count and examining the nodes making up the ELB.  Looking at the request metrics, it does not appear that traffic completely stopped, it simply dropped to only a few requests per second.   The old nodes did not crash, go off-line, or appear to be overly stressed, which would cause them to potentially drop traffic.   Perhaps learning more about your overall architecture might shed some light into the drop off in traffic.  I apologize that we do not have something more definitive at this time.  Please let us know if you have questions, or if you would like clarification on any topic.  We look forward to hearing from you soon.  Regards,  Matt R."
59020,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi Matt,   The ELB was fronting some servers serving a REST API. There are several clients for this REST API which are geographically spead out and separate entities, so it seems unlikely they all started to use the API at a lower rate. Also I tried manually to connect to the API during the downtime and the call timed out.  The strange thing was the ELB was marking the servers as unhealthy when they were fine and then a second later marking them as healthy and the flapping between these two states. To me this looks like an issue with the ELB. Could it be a spike in the traffic caused issues? I saw a small spike on the graph before the issue.

Through a testing program I send 5, 10 and 20 requests per second in a minute (in different test cases) to a PHP script which make calls to a internal server and only are attended about 400 connections in all cases. I have tested with 2, 3 and 4 EC2 instances.  Is there a limitation about number of concurrent connections using Load Balancer or EC2 instances?   I receive a lot of timeouts, likewise. Is there a timeout pre-configured in Load balancer?"
59012,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,   There is not explicit limit on the number of connection you can make to an ELB. I suspect that you hit some performance issues on your ELB and as a result you see limited number of connections.  The idle time out on ELB by default is 60 seconds so if your backend instances take longer than 60 seconds to respond to the ELB request, ELB will close the front-end connection to the client and that will result in a time out error on the client.  ( This is what I see ""HTTP/1.1 504 Gateway Timeout"" )   The time that it takes for backend instance to respond to requests is captured as 'Latency' metric in CloudWatch. For a list of all metric please go to: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/elb-metricscollected.html  I had a quick look at one of the two ELBs that you have 'TEST-LB' and it seems that the average latency is high on that ELB and sometimes close to 60 seconds which means that it is likely that this is why you see time outs.  If you like we can increase the timeout of the ELB, please confirm the ELB name, the region and what timeout do you want on it and we will increase the limit.  Kind regards,  Mostafa S."

59007,Amazon EC2 V0,"Lifecycle of custom software on an instance Hi,  I'm new to cloud computing.  I would like to install a custom piece of software on an EC2 Windows instance.  I understand that I can set up the instance, download the software of interest and perform the install.  This particular software requires an activation key, which I have.  My questions are as follows:  1.  Once I terminate the instance to stop incurring charges, what happens to the software I installed?  Is it deleted?   2.  Is it standard to just re-install the same piece of software each time you launch an instance just to be able to use it?  3.  Is there some kind of 'best practice' where I can install it once and have access to it whenever I want to use the cloud computing resource - but not be charged fees during the (probably long periods of) time where I'm not using the software?  Thanks in advance for the help."
59006,Amazon EC2 V0,"Specifics of Load-Balancing EC2 instances with Auto Scaling. My query relates to the best set-up for configuring Auto-Scaling of a Load-Balanced EC2 cluster.  Basically I have 1 LB with 1 EC2 instance in the LB cluster that accepts web-uploads.  I've set an alarm such that the LB should never have less than 1 healthy instance and if it does then the auto scaling should add 1 instance to the LB; if more than 1 healthy instance is available then reduce the number of instances running to 1. I've also set an alarm such that if the instance running in the LB is running at greater than 70% CPU for more than 10 minutes then add another Instance to the load balancer. The converse to this 1 is that if the instance is running for less than 60% for more than 10 minutes then kill the extra instance. My Question is how to properly set-up the alarms such that no instance will be stopped that happens to be processing an upload. If a new instance was added to the cluster because of a healthy instance or >70%CPU alarm and this new machine accepts an upload which it then needs to process, could this new instance be shut down mid-processing because the auto-scaling now determines it doesn't need it, for example because the original machine is healthy again or has lowered its CPU %. Thanks in advance for any feedback."
59006,Amazon EC2 V0,"At this time, ELB and Auto Scaling can not make any intelligent decisions about what instance to remove based on the activity. Here is a related (and unfortunately not very encouraging) thread:   Existing connections dropped rudely when instance taken out of ELB  Regarding your alarms, you don't need to set up alarms to maintain a healthy instance. If something happens to an instance and you haven't requested that number to change, you will get a replacement instance. Auto Scaling will make sure that you always have the number of instances you have asked for."

59005,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi there dekiss1,  I'm not sure I fully understand your question here. EC2 instances will have a number of charges including the hourly runtime rate for your instance type, EBS volume storage and volume of data transfer used.  Our current pricing can be found here: http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/ You will need to select the O/S type and Region that you are running your EC2 instances in, to get pricing for that Region.  If you are looking for information on what's included with the Free Tier, that can also be found up the top of that page also (and this includes the hours, EBS storage and data transfer).  Does this help to answer your question here? If not, can you post more specific information such as your use case so that we better understand your requirements.  Best regards, Phil P"
59005,Amazon EC2 V0,"The default provision limits are at http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html, which you can translate into effective cost limits.   There is no limit on bandwidth or API calls, so there is no actual limit on your monthly bill. It is a good idea to set up billing alerts (see http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2012/05/10/announcing-aws-billing-alerts/) so you have warning if your bill is growing too quickly."

59003,Amazon EC2 V0,"Cost to demonstrate oracle express I am looking into Amazon for the purpose of demonstrating two things using the cloud environment.  1.) Oracle Express - Connect to a database, input and display data, that's it!  2.) Fail-over - One server fails, oracle comes up on another server without allot of down time.  I am not looking to over-complicate this because it will only be used for demonstration purposes.    I have chosen the first AMI here https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-2#LaunchInstanceWizard.  Q:  What is the right path and what is the cost for just keeping something out there for demo-purposes that can be brought up on an as-needed basis as opposed to running all the time?"
59003,Amazon EC2 V0,"I suggest running this on EBS-backed images inside a VPC, which will provide for stable private ip addresses.  You can then stop the instances whenever you are not demonstrating them. You'll be charged for the rounded-up hours your instances are running plus storage.   For 200 GB storage that'd be about $20/month, plus runtime which shouldn't be more than another $20 if you are good about stopping it when you are done."
59003,Amazon EC2 V0,"Jason, thank you!  So you are saying that it would require a commitment of $40 per month to set that up even if it were not running all the time?  Sounds unfortunately high."
59003,Amazon EC2 V0,"Based on a very rough guess, yes.  You didn't say how many hours a month you need the instances to be up, the size of instances you need, or how much storage.  All of those figure in to the amount and can change it wildly.  You could also invest in automating the setup of your environment (something like Opsworks or advanced Cloud-init  Userdata scripts) such that you don't even need to preserve your EBS disks -- that'd remove the storage cost, but your startup time would be longer each time you want to use it.  You can put details into the  AWS Pricing Calculator  and get a more accurate estimate."

59001,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi there Jordan,  I've been able to locate your AWS Account based on your forums profile and have been able to identify the instance in question (InstanceID: i-56057360).  Looking at the configuration of your instance, I can see that you currently have 1 EBS volume attached to this instance at the root mount point (/dev/sda1 vol-1ae66133 which is 10GB).  I can see that you do have a second EBS Volume there which is 100GB. Was this volume created from a Snapshot of your original 10GB volume?  From the looks of things it appears that you have tried to attach this 100GB volume to the instance as an additional volume (so it would be a second drive inside the instance).  Could you make sure that your 10GB volume is detached from the instance (it looks like it now is, but worth confirming) and then attach your 100GB volume to the instance at the root mount point (/dev/sda1) and then try to start the instance back up from there?

58986,Amazon EC2 V0,"No Reserved Instances Found (us-east) Hello, For the last few weeks, once our reserved instances started expiring, I've been attempting to purchase new RIs to cover the existing servers. However, every attempt since has resulted in the response of ""No reserved instances found"" for every possible instance type, which I find odd given the ""unlimited"" availability of RIs in other availability zones.  Though I understand the AZ designations are randomized per account, we are in AZ us-east-1c and need clarity and input from AWS as to how best handle this inability to source RIs for our servers. Given that we do not want to be running on-demand instances at elevated costs (which we are unwillingly bearing at the moment) and do not want to migrate our entire network to another AZ, can someone please let us know what the status of our AZ is and whether it is being deprecated or otherwise permanently impacted in terms of RI availability?  Thanks, Jason"
58986,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi Jason,  I'm having trouble identifying your account from your forum ID.  Can you either post back from a forum ID linked to your AWS account - or failing that, give me an instance ID from an instance in us-east-1c from the affected account, and I'll check into this for you.  Many thanks,  Richard"
58986,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi Richard, That's odd—should be connected... Regardless, here's one of our instance ids: i-be736fc0 (m1.large). We're unable to purchase RIs for any type.  Hopefully you'll have some good news for us!  Thanks, Jason"
58986,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi Richard,  Any updates on this? We're racking up on-demand charges and would like to figure out a proper way forward.  Thanks, Jason"
58986,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi Jason,  Can you please trying purchasing reserved instances in a different AZ in us-east. The AZ you are currently trying to purchase RI in does not have the capacity available.  Thanks"
58986,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi David, The question isn't whether I'm able to purchase RIs in other zones (that much is obvious and possible), but whether, due to the alleged lack of capacity (which I find nonsensical given the supposed ""unlimited"" quantity of RIs in every zone), we will be forced to migrate our entire VPC infrastructure from us-east-1c to some other zone which may have this problem again in the future.  Also, given that RIs are supposed to be a billing distinction, I don't understand how capacity isn't available, particularly given that we're running the servers we already need and simply need to have RI pricing against those."
58986,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  As you might be aware, availability zones are different in different AWS accounts. We do not presently have reserved instances on sale for the zone that you see as us-east-1c.   http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html  The only thing I can suggest at this point is that you reach out to our billing team who may be able to assist you. You can contact them via the following link:  https://aws.amazon.com/support/createCase?type=account_billing  I am sorry that I cannot be more help here.  Richard"
58986,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi Richard,  Given that we'd previously bought RIs in this zone, you are saying that they are no longer on sale in that zone for some reason? Can you please explain the reason so we don't have this problem again in the future (if at the end of all this we need to migrate)?"
58986,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  I've asked a colleague from our billing team to contact you directly.   Please keep an eye on your e-mail - you should have something in the next half hour.  Richard"
58986,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi Richard,  Thanks so much for your intervention—got an email from your billing team and they said that were it not for your insistence, they would not have normally accommodated us.

58981,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi there Deep,  I've taken a look at the InstanceID that you have posted (i-3ad86f5f) and can confirm for you that the instance has been stable and has been passing all health checks with no problems.  This sounds like a network connectivity issue somewhere in-between your client network and the AWS network.  To assist you moving forwards, I would suggest that you run 2 traceroutes (or tracert from windows). Run one when your connectivity is fine (for a baseline) and run another when you are experiencing this connectivity issue. Run the traceroute from a client PC on the inside of your network through to the public address of your EC2 instance. This should help you to pinpoint the network connectivity issue.  Feel free to post the results back to the forum for some feedback, however please ensure that you obfuscate any sensitive information such as your client side and EC2 public IP addresses.  Best regards, Phil P"
58981,Amazon EC2 V0,I have messaged you trace route and other information. Thank you for your prompt attention.
58981,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi there Deep,  Many thanks for sending this through. I've taken a look at the tracroute that you have provided, and on face value it appears that there is congestion and a possible routing issue starting with the router that belongs to AirTel (182.79.255.33).  Having said that, I've asked our Network Engineering team to review this to see if there is anything we can do for you from our side.  We will post back to this forum thread when we have additional information for you on this one.  Best regards, Phil P"
58981,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello Deep,  Thanks for your patience.

58980,Amazon EC2 V0,"Spot Requests - How to SSH into the instance when price is too low? Hi,  I just started a spot request instance. I want to SSH into this instance and install some programs on it so when the instance becomes active (that is, when my price is not too low), they run. How can I do this?  Do I have to wait until the instance becomes active, and then SSH into it, and try to install my programs (hoping the instance does not become inactive while I am still installing my programs)? Or is there a better option? (My price point is low because I don't need the instance to run so much).  Best, appl3seed"
58980,Amazon EC2 V0,"You don't get an instance until the spot request has been fulfilled. Please see Tracking Spot Requests with Bid Status Codes for the different stages. Note the legend at the bottom of the big diagram. That being said, it's possible to have the instance execute custom commands automatically once it is up and running. You might be able to automate the installation of the necessary software by passing in user data. It is also possible to build a custom image (AMI) from an existing instance with everything installed and use that when requesting a spot instance.  Please note that spot instances are ephemeral. You get unused capacity at a low price. Keep in mind that the instance, including all your software and data, can just go away. There is no way to guarantee that this won't happen. You need to think very carefully about how to handle that scenario."

58978,Amazon EC2 V0,"An EC2 instance will always keep the same private IP address across reboots. However, if you do a stop/start, an instance in the EC2-Classic environment will get a new private IP address. It will however remain the same if you have an instance in EC2-VPC (with or without Default VPC). In that environment, you can optionally choose a specific private IP address on first launch."

58977,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,   I had a look at your instance (  i-6366cb4d ) and as you mentioned security group configuration is correct.   I also did a quick netcat test to your instance and got connection refused which usually means that no process is listening on that port.   Can you please share the output of 'netstat -nl' command with us. Make sure that you have a process listening on port 53 TCP and the private IP address ( or any address ) on that instance.  Also as a side note, please be aware that using EC2 instances as open recursive DNS is against the acceptable usage policy: http://aws.amazon.com/aup/  You may want to use it as authoritative for domain(s) which is absolutely fine.  Kind regards,  Mostafa S."
58977,Amazon EC2 V0,"Yes I had changed the process to listen on port 54 instead.  I've now changed it back to listen of 53 and below is the output of netstat.  The minute I change it back to port 53 I get no response from TCP.  Also note that from localhost port 53 is working fine, it is only blocked outside and of course I tried several different machines to make sure it wasn't something on my end.  This is a service that is needed for health care applications (wiki.directproject.org) undergoing certification, and I hope it doesn't violate the acceptable use policy.  If so I will of course take it down and find another way.  It would be interesting for future reference to understand why port 53 is blocked, though.

58960,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi,  I only seem to find 500s on this ELB: RequestBufferProdUW-764520477.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com and not the other.  These errors do not seem to be more than what they were for example on the 14th, and they do not seem to fluctuate wildly, and seem to stay at around one or two, occasionally fluctuating to four.  I saw on your US-West ELB that you had a marginal spike in network in that could have been indicative of increased connections at 2014-01-18 00:41 Z, does this roughly coincide with when ou noticed the increased error rates?  I am also seeing that your two ELBs display different traffic patterns, and it seems that they might not be sharing the connection pool adequately.  Other than that, it seems that Network in/Network Out, and CPU utilization is in acceptable ranges.   I recommend having a look at your Apache logs to see if you see some errors there, in addition, viewing memory metrics etc. might help explain the Gateway timeout issues.  I also see that you are only allowing ingress traffic from your ELB which is good.  Other than that, I am not seeing any scaling events, or significant changes in your ELBs that could explain this behavior.  Regards, Coenraad"

58958,Amazon EC2 V0,"Updating a security group disconnects all traffic When I update a security group, servers on that will disconnect all my users, even if the new rule doesn't apply to them.  It's especially bad if I add several rules through the command line interface. I added 20 rules at once, and it disconnected everyone for a minute or two.  Is there any way to update the security group and not have that happen? Or do I need to stop using security groups and start using a firewall on the OS?"
58958,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi there Eric,  Thanks for reaching out to us. This issue is compound by a few factors:  First is the number of rules in a rule group (total, not just changed), next it is the number of security groups applied to an instance (this includes the primary SG, plus rule referenced SG's), then the number of instances associated with a given rule group, which can be further compounded by the spread of the instances across Availability Zones.  There are several ways to approach this problem and each one has its’ own pros and cons:  1) Avoid having more than 100 rules. The most obvious answer is to restrict your Security Group to less than 100 rules. This is difficult and requires some planning for large organizations but using CIDR notation and defining ranges of ports can help.  2) Use multiple Security Groups: we actually allow 500 Security Groups per account in EC2 so potentially, 50,000 rules per account! This takes a lot of planning and it’s important to note that Security Group rules that “nest” don’t pass or inherit rules from other groups.  3) Make changes in small increments: customers that can’t avoid having more than 100 rules or who are not in a position to re-architect their Security Group rules should ensure that they make small changes at a time. Changes should be done in small bursts and the customer should allow a minute or two for the change to take effect (ping can be used to monitor)  4) Be ready for the blast: if there are many EC2 instances running in a Security Group and these are monitored, expect a simultaneous interruption for all of the instances in their deployment.  I hope this helps to answer your question and to give you some input around how to avoid excessive disruptions moving forwards.  We are happy to investigate the specific example from you to see if we can give some more specific guidance to yourself about your situation. If you would like us to take a look, please post back with:  Instance IDs and timestamps Security groups involved and how many rules were added/removed    Best regards, Phil P"

This exact AMI does offer the medium and I would like to know the best way to convert to the medium. Is it just a billing change? I read that I should stop the instance first. I cannot stop the instance only terminate it to upgrade. Please tell me the easiest way to upgrade to a medium instance.  Thanks Phil
58957,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi Phil,  Normally, EC2 instances are able to be re-sized from one sized instance to another. As you mention however you will need to Stop the instance to perform that step. Having said that, if you are not able to Stop you instance (and only terminate it), it would suggest that your EC2 is Instance Store backed.  If your EC2 instance is Instance Store backed, then unfortunately you are not able to change the type and size of instance. You will need to re-launch a new instance from your AMI, selecting the new larger instance type you require. This page has information around capturing an updated AMI from your existing instance to re-launch as a new one: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-resize.html#resize-instance-store-backed-instance  More information around Instance Store backed instances can be found here: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html  Details and instructions on changing your instance type if the instance is not Instance Store backed (so the root volume is an EBS volume): http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-resize.html  Best regards, Phil P"

58954,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello phy7tes,  I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble with the mysql55 package. It's worth mentioning that our version of mysql55 has an explicit patch that allows it to remain forward compatible with mysql56 databases. I imagine that this is the main point of confusion, as the posts you've linked are referencing the upstream mysql package, and not our mysql55 package.  To double check that mysqldump should work appropriately on Amazon Linux, I took the following actions: 1. Launched an RDS instance running mysql(5.6.13). 2. Launched a separate EC2 instance (amzn-ami-pv-2013.09.2.x86_64-ebs | ami-ccf297fc) to serve as the client. 3. Installed mysql55 on the client.     sudo yum -y install mysql55      mysql --version     mysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.5.34, for Linux (x86_64) using readline 5.1      mysqldump --version     mysqldump  Ver 10.13 Distrib 5.5.34, for Linux (x86_64) 4. Attempted to connect to the RDS instance with the mysql client.     mysql -u <username> -p --port 3306 -h <public DNS of RDS instance>     (I was met with a mysql prompt on the RDS instance, and was able to create a temporary table called 'test') 5. Attempted to get a mysqldump of the RDS instance's database.     mysqldump -u <username> -p --port 3306 -h <public DNS of RDS instance> <database name>  The mysqldump completed without error, and contained all the schema information for my database and tables. Could you please try the steps I've outlined here, and see if they work for you? If you run into any problems with the above steps, please post the errors here, and we'll take a closer look.  Thanks for using the Amazon Linux AMI."
58953,Amazon EC2 V0,"Does creating an image of a running instance change the private IP address? I know that if you manually shut down an image and then restart it, the private IP address will change.  Does this also happen when you use the ""Create Image"" function to create an AMI of an instance?  I'm hoping the Create Image function does something special to maintain the private IP address.    I know that I could use the ""No reboot"" option to keep the instance running while the image is created, but AWS warns you that this may affect the file system integrity of the image, so I'd like to avoid that.  So, does the ""Create Image"" function on a running instance keep the private IP address?  Thanks"
58953,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  When you create an AMI from an instance, it is advisable that you allow the source instance to reboot unless you have otherwise halted IO to your EBS volumes.  This reboot will not change the private IP of the source instance.  After the AMI has been created, you can use it as a template to launch new instances that are point in time copies of the original instance.  These new instances will have unique private IPs.

I've taken a look at your instance and it looks to be fully functional.

I've noted that I am able to connect to the instance on HTTP port 80 on that alternate public IP address, but not the ElasticIP address (ending in .19).  Are you able to confirm that you are able to Remote Desktop into the ElasticIP address ending in .19?  If you are able to Remote Desktop into the instance on that Elastic IP address, this would suggest that there is a web server configuration that is limiting the web server from communicating on the alternate IP address. As a first step you may want to take a look at the Bindings of the Website in the IIS Manager.  I hope this helps to point you in the right direction here.  Best regards, Phil P"

58926,Amazon EC2 V0,"Should I assign static IP explicitly from within Windows Server? In more details:  We have 2 Windows Servers 2012 running SQL Server Web on Amazon EC2 in the same VPC.  Network adapters are configured with static private IP-s via AWS console.  At Widows level, however when you go to Network Adapter Properties/IPV4/Properties it shows:  Obtain an IP address automatically  Obtain DNS server automatically  So what happens is that each time network adapters receive the same IP dynamically (for instance, 10.0.0.20 for one server and 10.0.0.21 for another).  Are there any implications of having Windows Server (or SQL Server) configured that way?  Should I in addition to assignment via Amazon AWS also set the same static IP for network adapter at Windows level?  Or should I set it to dynamic as AWS level and assign static addresses at Windows level?"
58926,Amazon EC2 V0,"Yep that's right; generally you would leave the Windows settings the way they are now, which is ""Obtain an IP address automatically"" and ""Obtain DNS server address automatically"".  That will ensure the server always has the correct address, for example if the server is stopped and then started again, or if you ever launch a copy of that server from an AMI.

58901,Amazon EC2 V0,"Using EC2 for acoustic simulation Hello EC2 Community,  I'm going to try to use EC2 to perform an acoustic simulation using Acousto   I have several questions:  My first question concerns the free monthly allowance: the simulation can spawn a couple of hundred nodes. Can I do it using my free allowance? i.e. Does that allow me to launch multiple nodes simultaneously, and eat through the entire month's allowance in a few hours?  My second question is about preparation.  Say I need to use one of the more expensive / high-end machines (which I may well need to do, as the simulation will use a lot of RAM).  It will probably take me several hours to configure the machine.  Is there some way I can avoid this, say by setting up my system on a free/cheap instance and copying a disk-image across?  My third question concerns rounding: if I perform 10 simulations each taking 10 minutes, is this going to bill me for 10 hours? Or 2 hours?  Fourthly, is there some way to force the system to automatically disconnect at 59 minutes?  (It would suck to get billed 2 hours for 1:05)  π"
58901,Amazon EC2 V0,"Sam wrote: My first question concerns the free monthly allowance: the simulation can spawn a couple of hundred nodes. Can I do it using my free allowance? i.e. Does that allow me to launch multiple nodes simultaneously, and eat through the entire month's allowance in a few hours?  The free tier gives you 750 hours of t1.micro instance usage. You can use these hours however you want. Keep one instance for the entire month or use 750 instances (account limits are in place, though) for an hour. It's the same thing. The t1.micro instance type is however extremely underpowered. It's fine for very light development/production usage. Simulations will definitely require a more powerful (non-free) instance type.  My second question is about preparation.  Say I need to use one of the more expensive / high-end machines (which I may well need to do, as the simulation will use a lot of RAM).  It will probably take me several hours to configure the machine.  Is there some way I can avoid this, say by setting up my system on a free/cheap instance and copying a disk-image across?  An instance can be upgraded/downgraded to another type. It's also possible to create your own image based on the instance, which can be used to launch additional instances. However, take a close look at the instance types listed in the launch wizard after you have selected the image you want to start from. These are the instance types you will be able to use. There are both PV and HVM images listed in the first step of the wizard. Your choice will determine what instance types you can use. HVM might be the best choice if you're planning to use one of the larger instance types, but it means that you can't start out with a t1.micro.  My third question concerns rounding: if I perform 10 simulations each taking 10 minutes, is this going to bill me for 10 hours? Or 2 hours?  If you keep 10 instances up for only 10 minutes, you are charged for one hour each. Partial hours are always billed as full hours.

58887,Amazon EC2 V0,"spot instances IP addressing in VPC issues Hello guys,  I'm trying to setup a working environment using VPC and spot instances. Nothing fancy, 2 subnets - DMZ (10.15.1.0/24 - facing Internet) and APP (10.15.11.0/24  - where application servers are running). A Linux instance in DMZ also works as a router between two subnets and I also have openvpn running on this instance for convenient access to servers in all subnets. If I leave everything to DHCP it all works fine - all machines in DMZ and APP subnets gets their private IP, Linux instance works as router between my subnets and gateway to the Internet.  What I'm having troubles with is making the system above to use dedicated, fixed, assigned IPs. Yes, after instance start I can 'create' a new network interface and 'attach' it to any instance, but there is a chance that DHCP obtained IP upon instance boot on some servers might be in my (reserved by me) static IPs range and I definitely don't want that.  Perhaps this is a problem with spot instance only, but that's where I want to do my testing. I posted earlier about difficulties assigning IP addresses upon instance boot here - https://forums.aws.amazon.com/message.jspa?messageID=516193, perhaps will get any advise there.  Or maybe I'm missing something obvious?  Thank you, Alex"

As far as I know, you can't choose a private IP address before the spot instance launches. This is just a wild idea (and completely untested), but what if you set up a third subnet for static IP assignments? Each spot instance is launched into the APP subnet. As soon as the instance is up and running, you somehow attach an additional network interface with an address of your choice from the third subnet. So it's basically your idea, but with one more subnet involved to avoid collisions."
58887,Amazon EC2 V0,"Thanks D.!  Indeed that might be an option and I will try it.  Edit: Yes, it seems to be working. For some reason Windows instances sometime fail to attach and detach an interface, and once I had to terminate the instance to basically reset it network (couldn't detach network interface) but looks like that the only solution.  I'm actually a bit surprised to see that questions about using predefined IPs get little traction. I'd thought that small-to-mid range projects would still use servers with static IPs. Guess it is so 20 century now...  Anyway, thanks for the push in right direction!  Alex  Edited by: api on Jan 15, 2014 5:01 PM"

I've also reviewed the health of the underlying physical host that your instance was running from at the time and I've not been able to find any signs of problems from the AWS side of things that would have attributed to your instance becoming unresponsive.  I can see from the logging information from this side that the instance did stop responding to ARP requests for about 13 minutes prior to you Stopping the instance.  This would normally suggest an Operating System or Application level issue which could have caused this issue. I can see that the CPU for the instance spiked sharply up to 50% shortly before the ARP requests failed (not sure if that is relevant however).  As a next step, I would suggest that you review the Windows System and Applications Event logs to see if you are able to identify a possible explanation in there.

58871,Amazon EC2 V0,"Best location for data storage Hi, We are looking at deploying a new application using an auto-scaling group to create a group of web servers, each of which will need to serve data from a large directory, containing about 5GB of data.  At present I am looking at storing this data in S3 so we have a central location, and using s3fs to mount the bucket on each of the web servers (ec2) instances. However, initial testing is showing that using this method is considerably slower than accessing data on ebs or instance storage. I am just looking for advice on what is the best way to achieve what we want? Thanks."
58871,Amazon EC2 V0,"Depending on how dynamic the data is, you might just prefer to keep it all on a single EBS volume, (a filesystem, shared), attached to one instance that is guaranteed to ""always be there"".  All instance would pull from there rather than S3.  I don't know that your ""s3fs"" will is any great performer.  (I've had bad luck using a similar tool for Windows servers.)  I wonder how much faster things would be if you access S3 in a more direct manner; of course, this may not be practical for your use case.  AWS offers virtual ""memcache as a service"", ElastiCache, which you might explore too.  I can't help but feel that the ""s3fs"" is the weak link here.  James"

58868,Amazon EC2 V0,"Can not connect to instance with Remote Desktop. I have an issue with my instance i-2f8a8860 It is a W2008 R2 server, running since last August. However since yesterday the remote desktop to the console does not work anymore, we get an error message stating : Remote Desktop can't connect to the remote computer for one of the following reasons: 1) Remote access to the server is not enabled 2) The remote computer is turned off 3) The remote computer is not available on the network.  My users just told me that in the last few days they saw a warning message on the server stating:  ""The remote desktop service will expire on the 14th of January""... but they did not inform me !  I can understand that remote application would need licenses... but accessing the console ???? I don't know how to reach the server to potentially fix it now ! What could I try, any idea ? I can see the instant is running fine : shared drives defined on the server are still accessible. I just can't access the console of the server anymore.  Thanks for your help."
58868,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi,  You can try connecting with the RDP client in admin mode (mstsc /v:Instance-EIP /admin)  If the licensing expires for Remote Desktop services and you have not deployed an alternate remote access solution, you will not be able to access your Windows server. While you can still stop the instance and move the volumes to another instance to recover the data, AWS Support will not be able to assist in accessing the instance to perform any sort of OS specific remediation, per our security policies. This OS configuration issue will persist through stop/starts, reboots, and instance type changes, as it is a setting not enforced by AWS specific infrastructure.  In reviewing Microsoft's documentation on the topic, can you confirm the RD Session Host licensing configuration? (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc754487.aspx)  RD Session Host liscensing has a 120 day grace period ( http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc725933.aspx).   Microsoft also provides some details on troubleshooting RD Licensing Services, if you've purchased CALs from a Microsoft Reseller and have installed them for issuance to your users: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh553163%28v=ws.10%29.aspx  Otherwise, the only way to restore RDP connectivity would be to detach the volume from your instance i-2f8a8860 after stopping it, attach it to another Windows instance and edit files on the old instance drive. Please note that since you will stop instance i-2f8a8860, the IP address will change on the next start, in order to keep the same IP between stop/starts you have to allocate an EIP (more infor on EIP: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html) and associate it with the instance. I also see that you have ephemeral volumes attached on this instance. Ephemeral volumes are **DELETED** on stop/start and only EBS volumes persist. So any data on ephemeral volumes will be **lost** and you have to restore them from backups. Also make sure to take a snapshot on the EBS volume of the instance before proceeding.  On the new windows instance: Go to Start -> right click on My Computer -> Select Storage -> Disk Management. Verify that the disk has been attached here and that it is an online state, it should be listed as the D drive, as the Amazon AMI for Windows 2008 R2 server only comes with a C: drive by default unless other drives are present on the new instance.  You can then follow this guide and try to reset the trial period of the Terminal Services: http://www.ehow.com/how_7543547_reset-120day-terminal-server-timeout.html  I hope this helps!

58866,Amazon EC2 V0,EC2 Security Groups I've set up two security both can access their own ports and one can access one port on the other but when I assign servers to these security groups the one that can access one port on the other doesn't allow access unless I specifically add the IP address of the server that requires access.  Both servers are in the same EC2 Availability Zone which seems to be a requirement for the security groups access rules.  Any ideas as to why this doesn't work?
58866,Amazon EC2 V0,"So you have a security group rule with another security group specified as the source? If that is the case, make sure that you connect using the private IP address or an EC2 public DNS name resolving to a private IP. In short, you need to connect over the internal network for the source security group entry to work. If you connect using a public address, you will not be seen as connecting from the source security group, so the rule won't allow access."
58866,Amazon EC2 V0,"Thanks for the answer, I misunderstood how it worked. From reading the docs and other online resources I was lead to believe that AWS converted access to it's own systems from public IPs to internal IPs. Not the case obviously.  Using the internal IP is working fine."

Is it a definitive price, or will it be still ""depending on your usage, such I/O request"" ?   Thanks a lot.  Edited by: cho7 on Jan 14, 2014 3:14 AM"

I found hard to estimate when I will reach this level (and when I'll start to pay...).   In US East (N. Virginia), it's $0.10 per 1 million I/O requests. See http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/#EBS for other regions.  I wanted to create several instances, but I'm afraid of having to pay for these I/O requests even if my total instances running time doesn't excess the 750 hours of the free usage tier. Is there a way to be notified before it occurs ?   First of all a quick note about multiple instances. Under the free tier, you get 750 hours for Linux plus 750 hours for Windows. Micro instances in both cases. So you can actually (almost) run one Linux and one Windows instance for free (you will exceed the EBS limit). But if you have, say, two Linux instances up for a full month, you will be charged for one basically. If you have two Linux instances for half the month, you are still within the instance hour limit.  AWS offers something called billing alerts. If you turn it on, AWS will send you an email when your usage exceeds a certain threshold. You can set that to $0 if you wish to get a notification as soon as charges are starting to appear. Please see Monitor Charges with Account Billing Alerts and Notifications.  Regarding the ""$0.035 per Hour"" price, for a micro instance. Is it a definitive price, or will it be still ""depending on your usage, such I/O request"" ?   It will still depend on your usage. Allocated EBS storage (including the root volume), EBS I/O, and data transfer will be charged separately. A static IP address (Elastic IP) is free as long as the instance is up and running. If you stop the instance (kind of like turning off your computer), there is a small hourly charge for leaving the Elastic IP address unused. That isn't covered by the free tier."

Has anybody experience the same issue, what can be done to prevent this? Is it a normal behaviour??  This is very unreliable from the EC2 service... stopping an instance from the windows command used to stop a normal instance and terminate spot instances...   Thanks,  Arnaud"
58860,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi there Arnaud,  I've been able to locate your AWS Account based from your Forums Profile. I've taken a look and can only see 1 EC2 instance that has been recently terminated (InstanceID: i-7a10412c, Instance Tag Name: SOLMAN). Was this the instance you are referring to?  If so, I can indeed confirm that indeed this was a Spot Instance, however I have been able to locate the API calls and can confirm that this instance was terminated due to a direct user request to terminate this specific instance rather than due to a Spot price change.

When launching the instance there is the option of what you like to happen when you initiate OS-level shutdown ( Shutdown behavior ). By default the value is 'Stop' which means that when you shutdown the OS the instance will stop.  In the case of your instance the value selected for 'Shutdown behavior' is terminate.  From the instance events timeline I can see that you have started the it at 2014/01/15 02:04:10 UTC , have you then initiated OS-level shutdown?  I also checked the volumes and the root volume is fortunately still available ( vol-06565c52 ) but second volume is deleted with the termination ( this is also a flag on the volumes that you can choose ). Unfortunately it seems that you don't have any snapshots of the this volume either. I hope that you have back up of your data somewhere else.  Please let us know if we can do anything to assist.  Kind regards,  Mostafa S."

I also checked the termination behaviour and none of them was configured to terminate on shutdown (except spot instance but that cannot be changed).  The harm is limited as the important information was on the C drive which is the one which is still available.  So this is ok, the only remaining concern that I have is that, from memory, I haven't changed the shutdown behaviour, as this is the way that I normally shutdown the VM, enabling to have a consistent db status etc...

Let's say I had 2 of these instances, does that mean I basically have a 320GB ""storage credit"" on my account so I wouldn't be billed for creating any volumes unless I go over the 320GB of storage that was included with these instances?

The 160GB quota applies to instance storage, so as long as your 30GB volume is ""instance storage"", then yes, it would go against your 160GB quota.

I have read that this is new deault behaviour, if you signed up for your account recently.  I did not sign up for my account recently - I have had this AWS account for at least 18 months. Why can I not use EC2-Classic? The machine price difference is an order of magnitude higher in VPC for some instance types, why should I pay more?

I wanted to share this documentation with you.  http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/default-vpc.html  and specifically this portion of the document  --If you created your AWS account before 2013-03-18, it supports both EC2-Classic and EC2-VPC in regions that you've used before, and only EC2-VPC in regions that you haven't used. In this case, we create a default VPC in each region in which you haven't created any AWS resources. Therefore, unless you create a nondefault VPC and specify it when you launch an instance in a region that you haven't used before, we launch the instance into your default VPC for that region. However, if you launch an instance in a region that you've used before, we launch the instance into EC2-Classic.--   If you have not launched an instance in that region it may be locked into VPC by default. Can you confirm this behavior?   To touch on your issue about the wrong prices for spot instances; we are aware of it and we are working hard to resolve this issue.

In short, I looked at the documentation, commands and management console and my own interpretation for the question posted below is no, but I'm looking for other viewpoints on this.  What happens if an auto scaling fails to start a new instance due to unavailable capacity ? (wink wink c3)  I'm not thinking about running into the per-account instance cap. Just what happens if an instance launch fails, then what happens?   First of all, can this happen at all? (I assume it does, since auto scaling shouldn't have any priviledged pool of instance capacity over other on-demand launches. Even if remotely unlikely, I think it is a possibility.) Does AS retry any immediate instance start failures immediately, or will wait for HealthCheckGracePeriod or DefaultCooldown or some other period of time before checking the scaling need (and then, noting that no capacity was added would re-try capacity increase)?   Following this I'm wondering what would be my options regarding on how to handle failures:   I can get a notification via SNS, of course (autoscaling:EC2_INSTANCE_LAUNCH_ERROR). ... not much anything else ... ?   So, is it possible to fall back on instance launch failure to launching an alternate instance type instead? What I'm thinking if for example launching c3.xlarge fails I'm entirely willing to launch i2.xlarge in its place (even with the higher cost) just to ensure the service stays within performance SLA.  AFAIK, it is not possible to specify multiple launch configurations for an auto scaling group, so I couldnt really figure how to do this apart from handling the SNS notification elsewhere, which could for example update the AS launch configuration and change the instance type, or something similar.  Ideas, comments?"

At any time the system is not under heavy load and enough resources should be available for it to keep functioning without issues.

As a side note the RDP port and http port both respond to a telnet test. If a stop start does not work can you attach the original volume back to see if that is still functional ?

58819,Amazon EC2 V0,"instance ddos defense Hello Dear.  I'm new to amazon, and would like some tips from you regarding DDOS attacks.  I wonder how I protect my instances of a DDOS attack.  The Elastic Compute Cloud already has protection against DDOS?  Thank you in advance."
58819,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello Henrydouglasl,  In regards to DDOS we do provide some protection already however it is still possible for a DDOS attack to have an effect on your environment and systems.  Generally for those using Linux as their operating system within the instance I would recommend configuring iptables to monitor connections and respond accordingly. In most situations it is a case of evaluating whether the destination exists that the connections are trying to get to as well as the source. I have included a number of links below to articles that are worth a read as well as a script that one engineer has written, you will want to not only adapt this to meet your requirements but would also recommend another for identifying those IP Addresses that are generating errors in your web server logs and then feeding those same addresses into your iptables configuration so it is up to date and you are able to adapt to the DDOS attack.  http://www.philchen.com/2013/01/18/how-to-use-netfilter-and-iptables-to-stop-a-ddos-attack http://rockdio.org/ayudatech/how-to-stop-small-ddos-attacks-some-basic-security-advice/  Script - https://forums.digitalpoint.com/threads/ddos-protection-script-for-iptables.1031456/  Lastly to ensure you are able to serve legimate requests we recommend using AutoScaling with an Elastic Load Balancer and increasing the number of instances serving the requests. By increasing the number of instances and using iptables you will be able to scale the environment to service the requests with all of the connections being analysed and iptables terminating those that are invalid. NOTE: With using an Elastic Load Balancer you will need to enable x-forward headers on your Apache system otherwise you will end up blocking all traffic from the ELB instead.  If you have any further questions please ask.  Regards,  Davin G."
58819,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hey Henri,  We have a lot of experience fighting off DDoS attacks on EC2 instances. One of our AWS customers had a 20Gbit attack last week and successfully fought it off. aiProtect is available on the AWS marketplace and uses a combination of caching, traffic throttling and IP blocking. Then there are also some mechanisms against SYN floods and malformed requests.  You can either run us as a prevention (and use the http(s) caching to offload your origin), or you can decide to set us up, only when you suspect that you are under attack. Setting us up is pretty easy, but you might want to do a trial run, so you don't get stressed out during an attack: (http://aiscaler.com/deploy -->then select the DDoS template under ""configure"". Then push the config file to your aiProtect EC2 instance). Then change DNS and make sure your origin only accepts requests from the aiProtect instance, so that an attacker can't reach your origin directly.   When you have set up an aiProtect instance, you will receive an email alert when facing an attack. If the attack gets too big, then simply move to the c3.2xlarge or the c3.8xlarge (with 10Gbit connection), using the same config file. We provide free support emergency support during an attack, but only if you are a preventive users (otherwise 175usd/h)  If that still doesn't do the trick, then launch an extra aiProtect instance in a different region and use Route53 to georoute the traffic to several regions. I've seen customers using this against 20Gbit+ attacks. We provide free mitigation support for this, although it's pretty simple to do yourself, if you follow this guide: http://aiscaler.com/wiki/dcc-wiki. If an aiProtect instance can't handle the RPS, then use ELB (or several ELB's - even ELB's go down under heavy attacks) in front of two or three large aiScaler/aiProtect instances.  You can also simply increase capacity as Davin suggests above. It depends on your applications, but most http servers are easy to take down. In that case, an application firewall and caching proxy will work better (weather that is from us or other AWS vendors)  Some links: aiProtect on the AWS marketplace https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B007OOKAZ0 aiProtect on AWS configuration walk-through: http://aiscaler.com/wiki/denial-of-service-protection-aws"
58818,Amazon EC2 V0,How can I access the Amazon Linux 2013.09.1 AMI? I don't want the 2013.09.2 AMI since it seems to not work with certain instance types.
58818,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  Unfortunately the old AMI of 2013.09.1 is no longer available.  Can you please advise which instance types you have encountered problems with so we can investigate this as we are not aware of any issues.  We have two types of Virtualizations methods available, these are Paravirtual and HVM, if you are using a instance type that is Paravirtual you will be limited to the t1, m1, m2, m3, hs1, c1 and c3 instance types. Using the HVM Operating System you will have access to m3, i2, hs1 and c3 instance types, this is primarily due to drivers and available resources.  For some operating systems such as Amazon Linux we support both however you must choose the appropriate OS during the provisioning phase and this affect the available instance types you can select from if you wish to change the size at a later stage.

58808,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi there,   The Elastic Load Balancer will check the health of the instance by running checks on the health target you have selected. You will need to ensure that the health checks are able to communicate with the URL that you have provided (in this case index.html) and that the response sends back a code of 200 to confirm it is ok.   Depending on the use case, you could also change this to a tcp check instead of pointing it directly at a URL.

58803,Amazon EC2 V0,"How to use the autoscaling feature in aws? Hi All,  I would like to know how to apply autoscale policy? I have an instance which i have registered in a load balancer. I am applying the autoscale policy to the instance. After the policy has been implemented the instances are automatically being created and terminated. I don't understand why it is happening so?  Any lead is appreciated."
58803,Amazon EC2 V0,"If the instances are being auto-terminated and there is an ELB involved, it is likely that the instance is not reporting as healthy in the ELB before the grace period is up. Make sure that your image boots up completely and passes the ELB heathcheck, and make sure that your grace period is long enough for this to occur.   Otherwise AWS decides your new instance has failed and terminates it, then provisions a replacement."

58800,Amazon EC2 V0,"EC2 instance ignores changes to associated security group after upgrading Hi,  I've just upgraded an instance from t1.micro to m1.small. That all went well, it's all up and running, but for some reason, I cannot get changes in the allowed ports in the security group to 'take'.  The correct security group has been selected, and when I look at the instance and click 'show rules', the correct ports are shown: amongst others, port 22 should be open, as well as port 80.  I can connect to port 80, I cannot connect to port 22.  I've verified that there is a disconnect between what is set in the security group and the ports: when I edit the security group and disable all ports, the instance should supposedly not respond to port 80 any more.   Yet it still remains responsive on port 80, despite the fact that the rules say it's forbidden. So it's clear that the machine is not subjected to the security group.  Help!!!"
58800,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  I'm sorry to hear about your issue.  Could you share the following details so we can take a look?   The instance ID. The current, expected behavior (which ports should be opened).   Regards, Szymon"
58800,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi Szymon,  Thanks for jumping in! In the meantime, I've made some progress. I've used the information in this article:  http://aws.amazon.com/articles/5213606968661598  to mount the instance drive onto another machine, and then I inspected the logs.   From the logs it looks like there is a built-in firewall (Shorewall) which is rejecting the connection requests; so as far as I can tell, the issue is not in the Security Groups, but in the instance itself.  I have now attempted to disable the firewall by editing the config files while the drive was mounted in the other instance, and then I'll re-attempt to use the machine with the (hopefully) now disabled internal firewall...  I'll report back...  Cheers,  Kris"
58800,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi Kris,  System-level firewall running on the instance sounds like a possible issue.  There's usually no need to use software firewall on EC2 (unless you explicitly need some custom features) so you should no longer experience the issue after disabling it.  Regards, Szymon"
58800,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi Szymon,  Yes, the issue was the built-in firewall; disabling it fixed things up. I have no idea how the firewall software managed to turn itself on: the machine was running fine as a t1.micro, and all I did was switch it to a m1.small and reboot. I suspect some auto-update feature in Linux must have auto-configured the built-in firewall software to become enabled on the next restart (which was when I did the upgrade). As you say, there is no reason for this firewall to be enabled.   Got it all back running again!  Thanks!"

58797,Amazon EC2 V0,"Monitoring Spot Instances Hi all.  I'm currently running some persistent spot instances. Essentially, I'm running an application that I want to run whenever the pricing tier is below a set price.  I've been trying this for a couple days now, and I've run into a peculiar issue: I have no way of determining whether or not a spot instance request generated an actual instance through AWS E2 during a time I'm not logged in. If I'm logged in, and the spot request generates an instance, I'll see it, obviously. But if the instance runs and terminates when I'm not logged in, there's no way of telling through EC2. I can, of course, determine what my application output, and I can look at my billing too, but there doesn't appear to be a way to determine if an instance actually ran.  For example:  If an instance runs for two hours, then terminates because the price got too high, and I log in an hour later to check, I'll see that the spot instance request indicates the price is too high, but I'll have no indication within AWS EC2 that an instance actually ran. I can check my application output on my side of things, or I can check my AWS billing and go through the line items, but there has to be an easier way, isn't there?  Thanks for your help."

However, sometimes after the last step, we see the instance enter the ""starting"" state but then transition straight to the ""stopped"" state.

58795,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi,  Instances can fail to start for different reasons, sometimes due to misconfiguration and in-occasionally due to internal errors.  If the console doesn't provide enough details then you could use the command line tools to start the instance instead as they may provide more information.  You could also retry the start request in case it was just a once-off.  In your example the instance failed to start because the EBS volume was stuck attached. In this case you can detach (or force detach if detach doesn't work) then re-attach the EBS volumes to the instance and then start the instance again."

My question - is - how do I do that ""scaled"", in terms of multiple instances.  I can do them one by one, but it takes forever.   I've been using putty SSH for login.  I'd like to be able to set a spot request price - make it persistant - and if it terminates - fine. But when it is available again and relaunches - it launches and runs the installs, and software automatically.   I am aware of the user data section under advance, but have no clue how to configure it.   Sorry, I've googled the heck out of this, and cant seem to find a straight answer.   I'm a bit of a noobie in terms of Ubuntu/EC2 - so if you can help the instructions would need to be clear.   Thanks so much!"
58792,Amazon EC2 V0,"A relatively easy way would be to build your own AMI (Amazon Machine Image). First of all, you install everything you need on an instance, make sure the software starts automatically on boot, and so on. Then you select the instance in the Management Console, hit ""Actions"", and select ""Create Image"". When you launch a new instance, perhaps by placing a new persistent spot request, you select your AMI instead of the default Ubuntu option that I guess you have been using so far.  If your spot instance is terminated and you have a persistent request, keep in mind that the next one being launched will be an exact copy of the original instance. The terminated spot instance and all associated data is gone at that point. There are ways to get around that, like saving data to S3 or have the instance attach a separate EBS volume. So launching instances with all software installed is easy. The challenge is to handle termination and state.  In case you need multiple instances and perhaps want to scale up and down more easily, Auto Scaling could be an option. You can have it request spot instances for you. Scaling is handled manually (just put in a number) or automatically (based on CPU usage across your instances for example)."
58792,Amazon EC2 V0,Great thank you for this help!    I'm not concerned about the data at termination state as the work its doing is pushing data to another local server in chunks.   A few questions though... (If you dont mind  )   If I attach an EBS volume - how do I install the software to that and not the root?    Once the instance is set up with updates/packages/installs.... how do I have an instance auto start a program from the EBS volume?   Thanks so much!
58792,Amazon EC2 V0,"An additional EBS volume is basically just another hard drive in your server. As you seem to have solved the data storage by pushing things to another server, you might not need more than one EBS volume. An EBS volume can be used by one instance at a time, but if you had a single persistent spot request it would be possible for the new instance to programmatically grab a ""shared"" EBS volume where the output from your processing is stored. That EBS volume would show up as a second hard drive. But in this case it doesn't look like you would benefit from anything like that.  Auto start is handled inside the operating system. I'm not sure how Ubuntu handles things exactly, but you'll basically need to search for how to start an application on boot."

58782,Amazon EC2 V0,"Costly AMI Image-Creation Bug I created a Image from an Windows 2008 R2 service running on a G2.2xLarge instance. This has a 30GiB EBS backed storage and a 1GiB EBS storage. This action correctly creates two snapshots, a 30GiB and 1GiB snapshot.  However, I just found out after a bill-shock that the AMI was saved as ""/dev/sda1=snap-9f428d8d:30:true:standard, xvdb=snap-81428d93:1024:true:standard, xvdca=ephemeral0, xvdcb=ephemeral1"". That means it creates a 1_TiB_ volume for every instance I launched, and I launched quite a few.   Naturally, I skipped most of the add volumes directly to the Launch page, since I couldn't have expected EC2 to bump up my storage needs by 1000x.  1) How would I fix the AMI without launching it with a 1TiB volume? I can't launch it with 1GiB because ""State Reason: Volume of size 1GB is smaller than snapshot 'snap-81428d93', expect size >= 1024GB.""   However, it states clearly in the Snapshot list that the snapshot is indeed 1 GiB. ""snap-81428d93 / 1 GiB / Created by CreateImage(i-4ef95a6f) for ami-1d635574 from vol-2a5b4069""  2) How do I prevent it from happening again?  3) Is there a way to seek recompense for this error?  Thanks!"
58782,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  I'm investigating this for you at the moment.  Could you give me the exact steps you followed to create this image? I'd like to replicate it in my own AWS account.  Thanks  Richard"
58782,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi there,  I think I might have found out how I ended up with a 1024GB snapshot, while trying to replicate the condition.  The Size textbook has an interesting feature in which the value loops back to 1024GB when you scroll below 1GB. A scroll action on mouseover is enough to trigger a change in value, even if the form element is not active in the first place (i.e. I didn't click on it with the intention to change the value)  Since I use a trackpoint, I might have activated the scroll button while moving the mouse from ""No reboot"" to ""Create Image"", which lies smack in the middle of the two elements.  So in likelihood it is not a bug as I claimed, just unfortunate UI/UX.   I would still highly recommend that this underflow wrap-around feature be taken out.  It was rather hard for me to have noticed this error, as it appears as 1TiB in the volume list and it didn't strike me that it was a T, not a G. Also, the snapshots created all indicate 1GB, and people are likely to skip the ""Next: Add Storage"" phase and go straight to ""Review and Launch"".  Thanks for looking into the matter!  Junyi"

The good news is the importer worked, but the bad news is that it only seems to support larger instance types if the guest is running Linux.  Specifically, if I use the Import connector to migrate a Windows 64-bit VM I can select from any of the following instance types:  T1.micro M1.small M1.medium M1.large M1.xlarge C1.medium C1.xlarge M2.xlarge M2.2xlarge M2.4xlarge  However when I select Linux as my operating system, I am limited to the following instance type:  M3.xlarge M3.2xlarge  Why the limitations?   The VM I am migrating is currently a single vCPU, 40Gb disk, but the importer is forcing me to to a minimum of a 4 vcpu, 4 disk instance.  This is way overkill for my needs but I have not found any way to change to an instance that more closely aligns with my existing VM.  I’ve tried using the command line tools with the same results.  I’ve even tried creating an AMI from the instance I imported, but trying to invoke an new instance of the AMI still is forcing me to the larger instance types.

You may need to detach the root drive and re-attach it to another instance to check logs or registry values.   Also I took a look at the 100 Gig Volume (vol-6f805f0f) , that volume has its Volume I/O flag set to False, that may be the reason you were unable to access it.

I am sure I am not the first one experiencing this problem.  Is there some kind of workaround? Can something be done along the lines: ""take a snapshot of the instance and launch new instance from this snapshot""?"
58762,Amazon EC2 V0,"Why does ec2-create-snapshot return so quickly on large volumes? Trying to script automated nightly snapshots of my instance/volumes.  I am looking at ec2-consistent-snapshot which allows me to freeze the file system while the snapshot is running.     The problem is it seems (to me) to return to quickly for large volumes. Clearly the snapshot sits at pending for a long while after the create-snapshot returns. If I am hoping to get a consistent snapshot of the volume how can this be.  Processes will be begin writing to the disk once you unfreeze the filesystem, so what gives?  Either: 1. I keep polling the snapshot till it reports it completed and then unfreeze the file system. 2. EC2 has an algorithm to make sure the snapshot does represent a moment in time.  Please educate me."
58762,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi,  Thanks for your post.  It would be best to wait until the snapshot finishes.  You can do this with the ec2-describe-snapshots CLI command and specify progress.  This can report the progress in a %.   Be sure and follow the standard practice of 'freezing' your file system across the snapshot initiation call - either with XFS freeze/unfreeze or LVM/dev-mapper suspend/resume.  The complete reference for ec2-describe-snapshots is located here:  http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/CommandLineReference/ApiReference-cmd-DescribeSnapshots.html  Kind regards, John G."
58762,Amazon EC2 V0,"You recommend that it is better to wait for the snapshot to finish. This can sometimes take a long time and keeping the disk frozen or unmounted for so long may not be feasible.  Utilities like the ec2-consistent-snapshot https://github.com/alestic/ec2-consistent-snapshot  1. freeze the disk 2. create the snapshot  3. As soon as the command returns it unfreezes the disk.   According to what you mention this should not work, but is fairly well deployed.  Can we make any assumptions about the create snapshot command, for instance before it returns it might have already copied the disk blocks locally and the rest of the time it is uploading it to  s3 or something like that?"
58762,Amazon EC2 V0,"Timnels:  I'm not an expert on the details of how EBS does this job, but I can give you the theoretical underpinnings for how snapshotting can return so quickly but then take a while to become available.  At its heart, a filesystem consists of a bunch of blocks with a table that tells it which blocks make up each file. So when you go to the filesystem looking for /home/eric/blah1.txt, the filesystem consults its list of blocks for that name and then goes out and pulls up those blocks so it can get the data that's in your file.  When EBS does a volume snapshot for you, the main things it's doing are: a) marking all the blocks in your current volume as ""frozen"" so they will not be overwritten; b) making a new copy of the master table that makes up your filesystem; and c) setting the new filesystem so that instead of overwriting existing blocks, it allocates new blocks for any change that must be saved..  ""c"" is the magic that makes this speed so possible. Copying the table that tracks your block usage is a very small operation. And then you just add newly allocated blocks on the fly when you need to make a write (you keep using all the unchanged blocks, which tends to be most of them for most filesystems), but you can go ahead with your old filesystem safe and your new filesystem editable. EBS has plenty of blocks and allocates them all the time, so it has all the resources that make it possible to do this job quickly.  After that, the delay you see before the snapshot is available probably has to do with making a copy of the volume in its old state (and in EBS's case, probably redundant copies, 'cause that's how AWS rolls). Once this is done the old blocks can be de-allocated for re-use.

58760,Amazon EC2 V0,If the instance still exists in your list my recommendation would be to unmount it's Volume and mount it to a new instance. With any luck you may even be able to remount the Volume to a new non-retired instance and get rolling again. At a minimum you'll have access to all your data and you can mount it to a new instance and backup what you need.
58760,Amazon EC2 V0,"Thank you for your reply!   Yes, I was able to get hold of mounted volume but there was also data stored on Instance itself. Apache web server was earlier installed there on the instance and on mounted volume and there are many HTML and PHP files in htdocs folder that I need to copy... Is there anyway I can start the retired instance again to copy files that are stored on the instance itself?  Thank you!"
58760,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,   I have taken a look at the instance that has retired, and unfortunately as it is instance-store backed, once the retirement date is reached these instances are terminated. As instance-store volumes do not persist through a stop start, any data not stored on EBS volumes will be lost.   We sent out the retirement notice on the 14th of December 2013 to the main email address associated with the account, with regards to the instance retirement.   In order to continue using your reserved instance you will need to start up a new instance with your AMI, and restore any data from your backups. You will need to ensure it is of the same type and platform as your previous instance for the Reserved Instance pricing to apply.   Kind regards,  Belynda"
58760,Amazon EC2 V0,"Belynda, thank you very much for your reply. This is what I was afraid to hear. Some data was stored on the instance itself and I believe it is now completely lost ;(. I did get a message but did not read it right away because was busy working on other project and then holidays. Did not realize it was that urgent and important until two weeks later:( when my instance is terminated. It was too short a notice .  I wished there still was a way to get data from expired instance until I confirm it can be terminated . I was using this instance for years and my credit card is on file I did not think Amazon will terminate it without hearing from me...  Anyways, I believe there is nothing we can now do about it. Thank you for you reply!"
58760,Amazon EC2 V0,"I believe you can request that a 'scheduled retirement' be delayed before the fact, but realistically any instance-store data should be treated as having a reliable lifetime measured in the low-seconds.    The AWS servers can fail and cause instance store data to go away at any moment, possibly without notice.  Once a AWS node has degraded such that a retirement notice is sent out, the instance is further imperiled.  It always could have gone away at any moment, but now it is much more likely.  It might not make it to the retirement date.  EBS-backed is more reliable, but even EBS can fail.  You can't really say your data is safe until you have it into S3 (very convenient as a EBS-backed volume + snapshots).   The 'source of truth' should never be instance-store data."

58758,Amazon EC2 V0,"The SDK makes it easier to work with various AWS services. However, the available EC2 functionality is limited to administrative tasks, such as launching and terminating instances. An EC2 instance works almost like any other virtual server. You choose an operating system and get full administrative access using SSH or RDP. After logging in, you will be able to install any software and configure it to your specifications.  In this specific case, you might install PHP as well as a web server. You can then create a script which accepts two parameters and outputs the result. On the Android side, you would use standard functionality to set up and send an HTTP request to the server.  If you are familiar with any of these things, you can use that knowledge within the EC2 environment as well. Don't get confused by the cloud lingo.

58755,Amazon EC2 V0,"Nothing is impossible, but it's a quite complicated topic (especially when multiple regions are involved). Moving a copy of the original instance over to another region is a manual operation that might require some downtime. Some configuration changes can also be necessary to make everything work as intended. It is probably best to solve this at the application level instead, as in setting up a brand new instance and look at any high availability or backup/restore options provided by cPanel/WordPress. These applications are outside my area of expertise, though. Route 53 can help you achieve automatic failover at the DNS level, but the real challenge is in finding a way to keep everything in sync."

The bug I encountered refers to the listing of the instances in an autoscale group: I am having one instance in the group, with 1 as desired value. I am listing the instances in the group - and although it lists only one, at a specific point it will list all instances, not just from that specific group (not sure what all means, might be all from the same region or all across regions).  From the tests I've made, my conclusion is that most likely this glitch appears precisely when the autoscale process of ReplaceUnhealthy kicks in, starting a new instance in place of an old one (the flow to replicate the bug was: have 1 instance running with 1 desired value, terminate it using ElasticFox, probably irrelevant and repeatedly watch (using a script) for the status of the instances in the autoscale group.  The python code used for checking the autoscale group status is:  ec2_conn = boto.ec2.connect_to_region(region) as_group = boto.ec2.autoscale.connect_to_region(region).get_all_groups()[0] instance_ids = http:// i.instance_id for i in as_group.instances  reservations = ec2_conn.get_all_instances(instance_ids) instances = http:// i for r in reservations for i in r.instances   for instance in instances:     print instance.id + "" :: "" + instance.launch_time + "" :: "" + instance.state  The corresponding output was:  j@ec2-ip:~$ ./cs-push-metric-to-cw.py instancename :: i-instanceid :: 2014-01-10T13:02:54.000Z :: terminated  j@ec2-ip:~$ ./cs-push-metric-to-cw.py instancename :: i-instanceid :: 2014-01-10T13:02:54.000Z :: terminated  j@ec2-ip:~$ ./cs-push-metric-to-cw.py otherinstance1 :: i-instanceid1 :: 2013-05-13T08:30:13.000Z :: running otherinstance2:: i-instanceid2 :: 2013-06-05T08:44:28.000Z :: running production-instance !!! :: i-instanceid3 :: 2012-12-20T08:05:33.000Z :: running production-instance-2 !!! :: i-instanceid4 :: 2012-07-11T13:52:29.000Z :: running ....... ...  j@ec2-ip:~$ ./cs-push-metric-to-cw.py instancename :: i-otherinstanceid :: 2014-01-10T13:08:56.000Z :: running  Edited by: gertcph on Jan 10, 2014 5:55 AM  Edited by: gertcph on Jan 10, 2014 6:34 AM"

The error can be caused by either one of more of the following:      Cause 1: Instances passing health check but not responding .      Solution: Verify that the health check is measuring the health of the application. If the web server is listening on a different port from the health check and is accepting connections but not responding, the load balancer may time out waiting for a response.      Cause 2: No instances in a registered Availability Zone.      Solution: Either register instances in each Availability Zone or enable cross-zone load balancing.

58753,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello davidt,  Thanks a lot for your answer.  I am a bit surprised, however. I thought that the problem was the ELB instead of the instance, since the health check entries recorded in apache access_log replied with 200 for a long period of time with the correct interval configured. I did not see any error log caused by the health check either. Meanwhile, I post the same request directly to the instance every time when I have a timeout problem with the ELB, and I can always get the correct response back from the instance.  About the possible causes described in the page, I am pretty sure that HTTP:80/index.html is the right health check endpoint. I only have 1 instance now. Do I have to register a instance in each available zone? If these are not the reasons, is there anything else that you could think of?  Also, what does INSUFFICIENT_DATA in the alarm mean?

Any ideas?  Thanks in advance  Edited by: Bob on Jan 9, 2014 2:25 PM"
58747,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi Bob,  The images we provide are pretty much a standard installation with the base set of features and current patches at that time.  For automating updates the first method that comes to mind would be to add a script that is stored in the Windows Startup Folder than runs when you log onto the system. I'm sure there are websites around that will be able to assist with some form of script to do that. I can see one potential issue and that is if a specific patch requires some form of interaction, this would then fail to apply but potentially it may leave you locked out of your instance.  But moving on from that, once you have updated your Windows Image to a level you are comfortable with I would simply take a snapshot and save that for future provisioning. If you then save that as your base AMI and then then use that for future instances, you will only need to update the differences going forwards, this will be a smaller subset of packages that will then need evaluation.  Regards,  Davin G."
58747,Amazon EC2 V0,Thanks for that   RE: Creating Snapshot from a running AMI - will have to give that wizz;   For other people the best auto patching concept I found last night was; http://www.experts-exchange.com/OS/Microsoft_Operating_Systems/A_6852-Automatically-updating-a-new-windows-installation-scripted.html but have not tested it yet.

I would recommend checking the log files for the system using the likes of /var/log/messages, /var/log/secure and any logs associated with your particular environment such as Apache, NGINX etc to ascertain what is happening at the time you encounter issues.  I would also look to use tools such as iostat, vmstat and additionally checking what dependencies your server has. Do you have a database? Is there a backup scheduled for that time that could potentially be running and preventing access. Do you have any processes scheduled on your system using the likes of CRON that could account for this?  Regards,  Davin G."

Depending on your situation, you might want to stop the instance during AMI creation or feeeze/lock the filesystems so you get a consistent image.  Read a little about AMIs for more background.  You can also just snapshot an individual EBS volume; basically, a copy of the entire volume to use any way you see fit.  The AMI itself uses S3 to store the actual data, so the cost is minimal, pennies for a small linux instance.  James"

58731,Amazon EC2 V0,"ELB 4XX and 5XX errors, trying to debug We're having an issue where periodically through the day, practically every single request in our ELB gets either a 4XX or a 5XX error. The errors we are showing from our server are < 100, so I'm sure it's not that. Our instances are very healthy and not busy at all during these times (they're even at half capacity). It seems that somehow the ELB is failing these requests before they even get to our instances, which makes it difficult to see what's actually going on. The ratio of 4XX to 5XX is usually 2:1 to 10:1, so I'm guessing that the ELB throws a bunch of 400s of some sort, thinks that the instances are unhealthy (even though they are not) and then starts throwing 503s.  It would be great if we could either see some logs from the ELB to see what's actually going on since these requests don't seem to make it to our back-end. We just need something to go on to at least point us in the right direction. We have no idea whether we're being throttled, clients are sending bad requests, or whatever else may be going on.  The last time this occurred was 18:07 to 18:11 UTC today (1/7) but it is a recurring issue each day.

I also noticed that the account which ELB belongs to has Premium Support enabled, so if you'd like us to take a closer look at this issue, please feel free to open a Support Case with us.  Regards, Szymon"
58731,Amazon EC2 V0,Sounds good—I'll just contact support.
58730,Amazon EC2 V0,"I screwed up - can I do anything? I bought my first reserved instance (1 year). I made sure to put it in the same availability zone. Then I waited for it to get past the pending stage, and was disappointed when my one running instance kept being billed at regular rate.  After some time I realized that I when I bought the instance, I selected a Linux instance. But my already-running instance is RHEL.  Oops!  So I emailed Amazon to see if they could rectify it for me...that was more than 3 days ago and I have yet to receive a response. A little disheartening after plunking down $2K.  Anyhow, is there anything I can do? Will they be willing to fix this for me, or will I have to sell the reserve myself and buy another one?  Thanks,  Shane"

The log (via the admin panel) doesn't show anything out of the ordinary (at least from our experience); any help on this would be much appreciated.  Instance ID: i-b1982f87"
58728,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  Thank you for using the AWS forums today.   Right now it looks like that instance is stopped, so I am only able to do some limited trouble shooting.  I also looked at your console logs and did not see anything that jumped out at me.   One test you can try to preform is to attempt to telnet to the instance over port 22. You will need to run a command similar to this :  telnet <IP ADDRESS> 22    This will let you see if you are able to get past the security group, or if the instance is responding over that port.  You may also want to look at the local system logs to verify that the SSHD was starting.  You should be able to shutdown the instance, and attach its root volume to another working instance to try and pull logs or look at any .conf files.    Thanks,  --AdamC"

58726,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  I currently see the instance failing reachability checks. Console logs are not dynamic and hence we don't see where the instance is failing currently.  To debug this issue, you could stop the instance. Detach its root volume and attach it to another running Linux instance as secondary volume. Mount the volume and check the logs under /<mount point>/var/log/boot.log or /<mount point>/var/log/syslog  If you can provide details on where it's failing may be we can assist you with fixing it. If time is critical for you, then would suggest launching new instance and moving the EBS volumes from failing instance to new instance and move the data over.  Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.  Thanks, Vivek"

If this is an issue with rhel and micro instances, why are those types allowed to be used?  I've saw somewhere that creating a mount point would fix it, but not having console access to the instance, I can't see how.  I intend to create an AMI from the ""paniced"" kernal micro instance and boot to a larger type.

58725,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  It appears the issue here is that the AKI(Amazon Kernel Image) associated with the instance does not match the updated kernel from the Yum, causing kernel panic.  Could you please provide the instance id in question and also confirm the version of Redhat(6.x) running on that instance.  You could try couple of steps here :  1) Stop the instance(EBS only), detach the root volume and attach it to another running linux instance, mount the volume and check /<mount point>/boot/grub/grub.conf and copy the lines for the new kernel(save it) and remove the same and leaving just the RHELxxxxx.xxxxxx.starter-ec2 lines. Unmount the volume, attach it back to the original instance as /dev/sda1 and start it back and see if it boots correctly.  Details about detach/attach could be found here : http://amazonserver.blogspot.com/2013/01/recover-broken-amazon-ec2-instance.html  Or  2) Create an AMI of this instance and launch new instance and during launch select the AKI from any one of the available AKI's listed here : http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/UserProvidedKernels.html  I cannot guarantee that this would work but worth trying it.

58723,Amazon EC2 V0,"It sounds like you might have been using Elastic Beanstalk or another AWS service that manages instances on your behalf. If so, you can fix the problem by opening up the relevant section of the Management Console and delete everything from there. In the case of Elastic Beanstalk, that would be the application/environment. This will bring down the instance for good. Terminating the instance manually will be considered as a failure, resulting in a new instance being started by the service to keep everything up and running."

In principle one would connect to the box with rsh and run 'sudo yum update' as an rsh command. But sudo can't be run except from a real tty (or at least it can't be run programmatically from Java for that reason). And all the ways to allow sudo to be run programmatically require sudo to be run as part of the process.

We'd prefer to remain on the AWS infrastructure, but the inability to source additional RIs is a bit ridiculous."

58699,Amazon EC2 V0,"Instance Terminating Immediately I am attempting to launch ami-9b9aadf2, but whenever I do, it terminates immediately without explanation.  The AMI includes an IOPS EBS volume.  An example is instance: i-b315d69d.  I'm trying to use instance type m3.xlarge."
58699,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi,  I've investigated the launch errors for your instance and it seems you are hitting the EBS IOPS limits under the account.

58699,Amazon EC2 V0,Thanks Valentin. Is there someplace I could have seen the launch iops limit error?
58699,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  Yes, you should be able to see this error. You will need to go into the EC2 Console and then click on the selected instance. In the box at the bottom of the page (the one that has all the details about that selected instance) at the very bottom there should be a field ""State transition reason"". This is where you would see that error.   I hope this helps, let us know if you have any other issues.   Thanks,  --AdamC"

58697,Amazon EC2 V0,"DHCP unreliable in VPC I have been starting instances in a VPC in us-west-2b. They change to status running, and the console after three minutes shows a login prompt. But sometimes new instances fail to get an ip address via DHCP. At first I thought it was bugs in my custom AMIs. But I have seen it multiple times with ami-b158c981, an official marketplace AMI.     With a custom AMI I have seen the boot.log say, ""eth0: Failed"". I have seen dhclient say ""No DHCPOFFERS received."". I went as far as putting a wrapper around dhclient to run dhclient in the foreground and redirect output to a log file. I also ran ifconfig before and after. The network interface exists. So it isn't a kernel driver failing to load. I pull this information out by not having the EBS volume removed on termination, and then attach it to another instance.    My question is am I doing something wrong, or is this real issue?  Edited by: razoodev on Dec 22, 2013 10:44 AM"
58697,Amazon EC2 V0,"I have isolated it to us-west-2b and CentOS 6.x. If I use Ubuntu 12.04 in us-west-2b it works 100%. If I use CentOS 6.x, including custom AMIs in us-west-2a, it works 100%."
58697,Amazon EC2 V0,The failure rate of CentOS 6.x in us-west-2b seems to be about 40%. I start ten t1.micro instances at once.
58697,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi there!  Thanks for sending in that data from your testing - I've fired it up the line, and will update when we have some more information.  Cheers Iain"
58697,Amazon EC2 V0,"I have a good workaround for this issue. It is to set ""timeout 300"" in /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf in a custom AMI. The CentOS default, per the dhclient default, is 60 seconds. Which is apparently too fast for us-west-2b.  The reason Ubuntu doesn't seem the same issue in us-west-2b is that they patch the default to 300.  Amazon still needs to solve the slow dhcp in us-west-2b."
58697,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  Thank you for sharing your work around. We also had another recommendation for a work around in addition to yours.   It is to change this value: ""PERSISTENT_DHCLIENT=yes"" to /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0.  At this time we are still hard at work trying to get a fix for this issue, I apologize for the inconvenience this is causing you.   Thank you,  --AdamC"

58696,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  I checked your instance and have the following observations.  1) Instance saw CPU spiked to 100% at 2014-01-06T15:32:00.000Z and may be it could have caused the error.  2) If the issue continues to reproduce, you can do stop/start to migrate to new host and eliminate underlying host network as the culprit.  Note: I didn't see any instance store volumes mapped but data stored on them does not persist across stop/start. Also you would get a new Private IP after stop/start and need to configure bindings if any. Please make sure to re-associate your EIP after stop/start as it looses its association.  3) Add more debugging to your application to provide more details.  Thanks, Vivek"

I've written a script to process spot price history and it's frustrating to see opportunities that I can't take up. Can I have EC2 support added to my account for the other regions too?   Thanks in advance,  Ken"

Can you please elaborate more on the issues you are experiencing?   You can launch ec2 classic instances only in us-east region, however, you don't have the option in other regions expect for VPC instances - is that correct?  Regards,  Marcin"
58693,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi, thanks for your prompt response.  That's correct, I can launch EC2 classic instances in US east, but only VPC instances in other regions (this is using the web-based management console).   If for example I set the current region to Sydney in the EC2 Management Console and look at the 'Account Attributes' box on the right it only shows VPC in the list of supported platforms. In US east this shows both EC2 classic and VPC.  Out of curiosity I've just run the following command using the aws command-line tools: ec2-describe-account-attributes supported-platforms  This returned the following result, which indicates that my account does indeed support EC2-Classic  ACCOUNTATTRIBUTE	supported-platforms VALUE	EC2-Classic VALUE	EC2-VPC  However, EC2-Classic support only shows up in the US East region, at least in the web based management console. I'm beginning to think it would be worth seeing if I can launch EC2 Classic instances in other regions from the command-line, although this is not something I've yet gained experience of.  Could the web based UI be out of sync with my account somehow? Is there anything region specific about the EC2-classic attribute on my account?  Thanks for any assistance you can provide.  Ken  Edited by: kjmac123 on Jan 3, 2014 1:36 PM   an update *  Looking here it seems that EC2-Classic support is indeed set per region, and that as I hadn't used anything other than US East before a certain cutoff date (if memory serves me) , this may be why I'm having issues. See this link: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/default-vpc.html  It would be fantastic to enable EC2-Classic on these other regions, I'm hoping there's just an attribute that can be easily flipped on for each region at your end."
58693,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  Thanks for posting today.   You are correct, the new default is to assign all instnaces into a VPC. If you are reaching this limitiation in other regions it is because that is the default behavior.    You were correct in the documentation you linked to us   ---If you created your AWS account before 2013-03-18, it supports both EC2-Classic and EC2-VPC in regions that you've used before, and only EC2-VPC in regions that you haven't used. In this case, we create a default VPC in each region in which you haven't created any AWS resources. Therefore, unless you create a nondefault VPC and specify it when you launch an instance in a region that you haven't used before, we launch the instance into your default VPC for that region. However, if you launch an instance in a region that you've used before, we launch the instance into EC2-Classic. ---  I am sorry if this is causing you issues within your system.   Thank you,  AdamC"

58691,Amazon EC2 V0,"UDP Packets possibly being marked as DOS Attack? Hi, I have embedded devices that send UDP packets to our servers.  However the problem I am having is after they have sent a couple hundred packets they begin to come in sporadically and randomly.  Some seem to just disappear.  I have checked and the devices are still sending all of these packets.  Does amazon have software to alleviate a Denial of Service Attack that may possibly be marking these packets as false positives if they are sent too regularly?  Or am I going crazy and this cannot be the problem?"
58691,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  Would you please provide some additional details about the UDP traffic that is being sent, such as volume / frequency? Are these going to EC2 instances, if so, can you provide the instance ID(s)?

58691,Amazon EC2 V0,"The instance ID that is receiving the data is i-a29fecef  The packets are about 170 bytes long, all UDP on port 6113 and are sent in bursts ranging from 1 to 1500 packets at a time depending on the client sending the data.  The gaps between each packet are about ~10ms apart"
58691,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  I believe the symptoms you have originally described is unfortunately the expected behaviour of UDP.  As opposed to TCP, UDP does not have mechanisms for ensuring message acknowledgement, retransmission and time out. Also it does not have mechanisms to reorder UDP messages as they arrive to the destination.  You might want to consider using TCP instead of UDP if that is possible with your application, or implement the features mentioned above within your application layer, again if that is possible."
58691,Amazon EC2 V0,The thing I find odd is that I managed to mitigate the problem by increasing the delay between packets to 1s.  This results in a 99.99% success rate for me.

Let's say I purchased a reserved instance from a third party on the RI marketplace.  2. I would then, for example after a few months and before the term expires, purchase an additional reserved instance from either AWS or a third-party-seller (of course using the same Reserved Instance Type, Platform, Instance Type and Availability Zone). Would the term of the second reserved instance be added to the first - ie would it extend the expiration date if only one instance is running at all times?  Or, phrased differently: Can reserved instance terms using the same configuration, term length and AZ location, be bought at different times in order to extend the total combined expiration date?  As always, thank you all very much.  Regards, Georg"

I can see from the console output on the terminated m1.small and t1.micro instances that the same errors about reaching the metadata server were present, though you mentioned that these instances did not fail reachability checks.  Does the instance that was used as the source of the AMI have a static IP configured within the OS?  Or is it using iptables rules that might be preventing traffic from reaching the metadata server?  Since we cannot see inside of the instances to determine what may be causing the issue, checking the source instance might be useful at this point.  Another option would be to stop a problematic instance and detach or make a snapshot of its root volume.  This root volume (or an EBS volume created from a snapshot) could then be attached to another Linux instance to examine the application and OS logs and configuration settings in more detail.

You will need to reboot the instance to regain access to it. If that does not work, a stop/start may be required. Once you have regained access, you will need to analyze the Windows logs of the instance to determine what may have caused the CPU to spike.  Additionally, I have also noted that a lot of ports are open to the Internet on this instance. This is not a recommended configuration and may leave your instance open to outside attack.

58675,Amazon EC2 V0,"Did some damage while sudo to root on my instance, now it does not run. I was trying to move a text file from one file system to another, and right-clicked improperly.  After the command finished what it was doing, I could no longer use Linux commands like ls.  I logged off and tried logging back in, but got ""connection refused""  I stopped and re-started the instance, and got the following warnings:  How do I recover from this / prevent it from happening in the future?:  failing to read files in the /local/domain directory."
58675,Amazon EC2 V0,"You might try launching another basic linux instance, and then detach the root volume from your dead instance to the new instance.  Then, while using the new instance, examine the volume and see if you can un-do whatever you did.  Presumably you moved a bunch of system binaries to some non-standard location.  (If instead you deleted them, it might be the end, unless you are very clever.)  The goal is to fix things while the original root EBS volume is mounted to the new temporary linux instance.  The, you detach from the temporary instance and attach back to he original, and start the original.  In the future, crating periodic AMI of your instance can give you a nice emergency point-in-time backup; you could simply launch an instance from the AMI and at least have something running.    Be careful with sudo...  James"
58674,Amazon EC2 V0,"hvm versus standard instance Let's say you have two ec2 machines, both are Ubuntu 12.04, but one is hvm and the other is not.  would compiled code be binary-compatible between them?  could you copy executables and compiled programs, from one machine to the other?  While we are on the same topic, I wonder if you had slightly different versions of Ubuntu 12.04, like minor release differences, but both are the same machine type, if that would be ok.     so, that's an even more general question.  thanks."
58674,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi,  You can run the same compiled binaries on Linux running in either HVM mode or PV mode. The difference between the two is how the Linux kernel interoperates with the hypervisor.  However, if you run Linux in HVM mode on newer instance types, new instructions like AVX are supported. So if your compiled programs do not correctly check to see if these instructions are supported, they could crash with an Illegal Instruction message if you run them in PV mode. This article from Intel talks about how to use CPUID to check for instruction support.  As for minor release differences for a particular Linux distribution, this somewhat depends on the distribution. For Ubuntu, minor releases within the same major release should be binary compatible.

I have tried launching it in different availability zones to no avail. Same error shows up in the logs. Also tried launching without assignment to an elastic IP.  The latest launch attempt via spot request is instance ID i-fc00e7d2.   Any ideas?"
58672,Amazon EC2 V0,"It appears this issue is related to the instance type and/or the availability zone.   This AMI is normally launched with  instance type m3.xlarge.

There appears to be a problem with either the instance type on your end, or 2 or more of your availability zones for the us-east region."
58672,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,   Looking at the instance state, it seems like the windows OS is struggling to find the route to EC2 metadata service. Generally this happens when you assign a static IP to the instance.  Since you have mentioned that you have been using the same AMI without any issue until recently, I assume the static IP doesn't apply in your case. Most likely could be caused by an outdated EC2Config service.  Could you try to update the EC2 config service on one of the existing instances as mentioned here - http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/UsingConfig_WinAMI.html#UsingConfig_Install   then create and AMI from that one and see if it works?.  Look forward to your reply. Thank you."
58672,Amazon EC2 V0,"Thanks for your reply.  I do not believe the EC2 Config service is the culprit. As per my previous post, this AMI was successfully launched twice in the last couple of hours using a different instance type and availability zone.  It seems that using the zone/instance type combinations i posted earlier are what consistently lead to the issue. Are there any current system issues or outages that could be causing this behavior?  Thanks again."
58672,Amazon EC2 V0,"Can I get an update on this? I have since been able to start several instances using this AMI with instance type m2.2xlarge. So the AMI is not the problem.

58672,Amazon EC2 V0,"I upgraded the EC2Config service as well as the paravirtual drivers. I was then able to launch this AMI under the desired instance type.  Any idea why this happened (i.e. why are existing AMI's created under previous versions of hte EC2Config/PV Drivers not working on some instance types)? Is there a list of instance types the old drivers/versions no longer work for?

58669,Amazon EC2 V0,The ami-id in question is valid in EU only.  It is not present in the US.  So I am trying to launch an EU ami-id and it is not finding it.  It does find any US ami-id with no problem.  Is there anything that would limit a request to your Web Services API that would not let me find and launch a valid EU ami-id but let me launch US ones with no problem.  Our account works fine and is authorized in EU.  We currently use RightScale interface if we are launching manually.
58669,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,Can anyone answer this question?  Is there something special that needs to be adjusted in our account to ""see"" our images in AWS-EU like we can can currently see and operate on our resources in AWS-US?  Or is there something missing from my run instance request above that I need to add?"
58669,Amazon EC2 V0,If it does find the US ami-id then I would have thought that would confirm that it is a region problem. It shouldn't be able to find and use the US AMI from within the EU.
58669,Amazon EC2 V0,"I am probably not being clear enough.Recently we migrated some images to AWS-EU and registered them.   We created AWS-EU security groups, etc.  The whole 9 yards!  Using a 3rd party AWS interface called RightScale we are able to launch those EU ami-ids no problem.   So remember, the AWS-EU images are real and properly registered and are operating in the EU region.We recently created our own application using the Amazon Web Services API to directly launch images.  It works fine when performing operations using images in the US.  However, we are not able to use it to launch images in the EU using these properly registered and functioning images from the EU Region.When using the API it defaults to the region that has the most capacity if you do not specify what AvailabilityZone where you want to launch it.  Because we were only operating in the US region until recently we would just send it the ami-id, security groupID, MinCount and MaxCount and the keyName, the new instance would launch.Now we want to launch our images that are in the EU Region.  According to the API instructions it says you can specify the region by sending the proper AvailabilityZone with your request and of course all of the other values that you send must be valid for the EU Region.  We are sending the AvailabilityZone of eu-west-1a and the rest of the parameters are indeed in the EU Region.  However it is coming up with the error that this ami-id does not exist, yet we know for sure it is there and properly registered.  It is as if it is still searching or connecting to AWS-US and ignoring the specification that we are wanting to work with AWS-EU AvailabilityZone.Currently the same account and credentials are being used in both Regions.  We are functioning in both regions using the 3rd party RightScale interface which is using that one set of credentials. So my question is, why am I getting this error?  Is it a permissions problem regarding how the Web Services API works, something that customer service would have to enable for our account, or do I need to send more information in my SOAP message that will cause it to stop defaulting to AWS-US and connect to AWS-EU?"
58669,Amazon EC2 V0,"Regardless, it is still going to be a region issue somewhere along the line. Short of looking at your S3 buckets and your  AMI listing in the EU region I don't know what else can be done.When you say you are specifying the EU region..........is this for launching or for registering? You can't just magically launch an AMI by specifying the region. The AMI has to be known to the EU region (it has to be in the AMI list when you click on the EU region in the console) and it has to be available in an EU S3 bucket - properly registered. You aren't giving enough detail to be helpful. Obviously Rightscale is doing something additional if it works through there."

So I guess that means there is something wrong with the computer which I am trying to scan from, or something else?  I am using nmap from a Mac OS X mini, and I verified that the firewall is disabled. Also I can scan port 80 on my EC2 from this machine so maybe there is something strange going on with port 3306?  Since nmap is not returning port 3306 opened, I know it will not work, but just to make sure I tried to connect using ""Sequel Pro"" tool using ""admin"" user name and host = public DNS. When I do this I get ""Unable to connect to host XXX, or the request time-out"" with error 61.   I'm guessing now that there may be some other firewall between my client and server.

58667,Amazon EC2 V0,"DNS for ELB reports extra, invalid IP Address The DNS record for our elastic load balancer (cleanguru-255974093.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com) is reporting two IP addresses:  54.201.180.153 and 54.218.22.170  The first works as intended.

Other suggestions?"
58667,Amazon EC2 V0,"The ELB should have at least one IP address in each enabled availability zone. Not sure why there wasn't a third IP previously - I guess the ELB was smart - but it makes sense that you are still seeing two IP addresses. Does the ELB consider all instances to be in service?

The load balancer appears to be reachable from the Internet and can obviously reach both instances with health check requests. It's like the actual non-health check requests doesn't go through all the way. But it seems like you need some assistance from AWS.  An AWS representative will hopefully spot this thread."
58667,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  I have investigate your issue and hope to have addressed it. Please test and let us know if we can help with anything else.  Thanks"
58667,Amazon EC2 V0,"Thank you David. Unfortunately, it does not appear fixed.  If I use this service to lookup the DNS record: http://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=a%3acleanguru-255974093.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com&run=toolpage  I see two IP's reported. However, if I invoke each in a browser, I see that only one is working. http://54.218.22.170/ (Does not work) http://54.201.18.208/ (Works)"
58667,Amazon EC2 V0,Bump We are still seeking assistance with this issue.
58667,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,  It is a expected behaviour of your ELB to return two IPs as you have configured two Availability Zones on your ELB.  I have investigated this issue further and can verify that the ELB is working as expected, However, i tried to run a curl directly on the configured EIP of yoru instance and do receive a empty reply from your instance i-52ea8b66, can you please check the error logs and the configuration on your instance to verify it is working as expected.  Regards, Peter"
58667,Amazon EC2 V0,"This is now resolved. What we concluded was that PHP-APC was causing Apache to respond with an empty result when a request was made with no host header. The ELB was succeeding it's healthcheck for that availability zone, but was not routing traffic for that zone's public IP. However, it was routing traffic into that zone from the other zone's external IP.  We were not able to get Apache to respond properly while PHP-APC was enabled, so we disabled PHP-APC. Proper routing through the ELB then resumed."
58666,Amazon EC2 V0,"Cannot download from browser on Win Instance I'm (a newbie) running instance i-6fbb9421.  First I tried using Explorer to install Chrome. I couldn't download anything. I thought it could be an Explorer issue so I got the Chrome isntaller via Dropbox.  After installing Chrome, I notice that I cannot download anything either... so basically I cannot install the software I need running on the server.  Yesterday I was trying with another instance in Oregon and didn't have any problem at all but decided to close it and open a new one in Dublin.  What could be causing this?"

58663,Amazon EC2 V0,"New EC2 instance : Is the public IP assigned Elastic ? Hi,  I have created an EC2 instance and a public IP was automatically assigned to it. I can see it in the ""Public IP"" field. In the console, the ""Elastic IPs"" list is empty.   I am planning to create another instance for testing purposes, and as a backup to the first one. I was planning to use Elastic IP's in case something wrong happens with the first instance. I don't want to bother changing the DNS records etc.  1 - Is the IP assigned to the first server an Elastic IP ? 2 - Will I be able to use this IP with my second instance ?  Regards."
58663,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hello,   I took a look at your instance and I see that your instance has a public IP, but it does not have an elastic IP. This means that when the host is stopped, the IP will be disassociated from this instance. When the instance is started again, it will receive a new public IP.   If you would like to use Elastic IPs for your instances, you can create the elastic IPs in the AWS console and assign them to the instances. This will replace the public IP with the address of the Elastic IP. You can do this with both the original instance and the new instance.   Please let me know if you have any questions.   Thanks,  Chris"
58662,Amazon EC2 V0,"Cant connect externally from server I have a windows 2008 rs ec2 instance; when I first set it up I downloaded and installed a few utilities and ran windows update.

Not sure what I did, but Im not longer able to get out from the server; for example I have http://www.google.com listed in an ie trusted website, but it just hangs.  pings time out, nslookups give me :      <ip>.<region>.compute.internal can't find wwww.google.com: Non-exi      stent domain  I can get to my web site through my client browser, no problems there.  But Im unable to install firefox, run windows update, etc.  Anyone have any ideas for me to try?"
58662,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi there markaurit,  Given you are able to RDP into the instance, it sounds like network connectivity is working, however DNS resolution may not be working.  It sounds like you have changed the DNS Resolver settings for the instance. Have you set Windows to use a Static (or Fixed) IP address? Or have you manually changed the DNS Server settings to use a specific IP address? If so, these should all be set to be obtained automatically.  Once you have checked those, could you open a command prompt and type in the following and press enter: nslookup  If you could copy and paste the output of this back into the forum thread, this will tell us the IP address that your instance is using for domain name resolution.  In addition, could you also post back with the EC2 Instance ID so we can take a look at the DNS resolution from our side for you.  Best regards, Phil P"
58662,Amazon EC2 V0,"Hi Phil - I took a few images and placed them in a pdf, but it wasnt allowed when I attempted to posted.  So I zipped it, which also wasnt allowed.

The ip/dns settings (v4) are both ""Obtain automatically""; while I obtained the instance a couple of months ago, I seriously doubt I would play with these settings.  I only know enough to get myself in trouble. 3. Instance: i-2f0d641b 4. Private DNS: ip-172-31-12-83.us-west-2.compute.internal  Thanks for your help, let me know if you need any more information.

58662,Amazon EC2 V0,"Yes - and no.  Same behaviors in that I cant get out to google.com and windows update cant get out. But (and I guess I didnt think to try this earlier) I can get out to amazon.com, bing.com, and mozilla.com. I went into the ie security trusted zones and removed everything (it had the windows update urls) and verified they werent in any zones, then I rebooted the server.  Same behaviors. So my initial issue subject isnt correct - I cant get out to any google.com sites and windows update doesnt work, apparently (I searched on this on my client computer) due to a lack of connectivity, error message 80072EE2. I checked, the windows updated service is running and set to start automatically.  I didnt see anything obvious in the windows firewall rules, but I dont have much expertise there."
