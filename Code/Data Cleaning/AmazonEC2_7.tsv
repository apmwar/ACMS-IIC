Amazon EC2	"Missing something simple Im sure.  Unable to view server on the internet
Hello,
I am new to Amazon Web Services (1st day).  Im setting up an EdX server for my school to see about providing online classes for the students.  I was able to SSH into the machine and have it configured correctly I believe.  I also have gone through the updates for the EdX system.  Now Im not sure where to go from here.  The instance ID is: i-8647e34d   Supposedly I should be able to see the site but Im not even  sure what to put in for a URL.  Im usually pretty tech savvy but Im a bit out of my depth here.
Any help would be appreciated

Amazon EC2	"Re: Missing something simple Im sure.  Unable to view server on the internet
Two things:

Hostname/IP address
Make sure that you allocate an Elastic IP address to the instance. You don't need to do this to access the instance, but it keeps things simple. When performing certain actions, the public IP address can change, unless you're using an Elastic IP.

Check the public DNS property of the instance for the host name (or the Public IP) for the address to use to access the instance. This will change when you allocate an EIP to the instance!

Security Groups
Make sure that the security groups allow access to the appropriate port numbers. In the case of web traffic this is normally TCP ports 80 & 443. It's normally best practice to restrict access to port 22 to those IP addresses that should be accessing the machine.

You may need to create a new security group to allow the web traffic and attach it to the instance."

Thank you so much.  I knew I was missing something basic.  I am now able to hit the website.  I do get an intermittent Bad Gateway Problem so I may be back to ask about that.

Amazon EC2	"Instant is running but unreachable even after reboot
Summary:

Instance ID: i-8a4c2dda
Problem: Following ""Install updates and shut down"" action from windows earlier this morning followed by restart from Amazon console, it shows up as running but cannot access sites on it or RDP to it.


Details
Earlier this morning I used the ""Install updates and shut down"" option from Windows on one of my instance. Eventually the instance ended up in the ""stopped"" state and I used the ""Instance State -> Start"" command from Amazon AWS EC2 dashboard to restart it. 

After a while the instance was showing up as ""Running"" but the ""Instance Status Checks"" was failing and I could not connect via Remote Desktop to it or access web sites running on it.

I used the ""Instance State -> Reboot"" command but the instance just came back in the same state.

Right now I'm creating an Image and will try to reboot a new instance but I was wondering if anyone had ideas or solutions to our problem.

Thanks!"

Amazon EC2	"Re: How to set MTU permanently on Amazon AMI Linux
That's ubuntu, not  amazon linux.  Here is how you permanently set the MTU on amazon linux instances. This seems pretty important because hanging mysql and redshift queries seems like a common problem, due to the default MTU value being 9001 (jumbo)

Add MTU=1500 to /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0

Add the following line to /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf

request subnet-mask, broadcast-address, time-offset, routers, domain-name, domain-search, domain-name-servers, host-name, nis-domain, nis-servers, ntp-servers;

Try other values if 1500 doesn't work. In my case, 1000 was needed, due to whatever was set on our DB server at our location.

Hello,

It sounds to me like you should either add a cache layer or move to a bigger instance type.

One relatively easy thing to do would be to move your statics to Amazon S3, and set up a CloudFront distribution to keep performance high. See here:

An AMI is a machine image, you will need that to launch a new instance. A Snapshot is a copy of a virtual disk.

It is possible to create an AMI from a Snapshot providing the snapshot is of the correct disks. However, from what you have said I cannot ascertain if your issue is related to a mistake in terminology or technology.

Hi guys,

The past year or so, I've been moving the company I work for over to AWS.  It's going great, but there is one thing where I've hit a bit of a wall.

We have several devs working on several things.  The way they develop is they develop on an in house server which is linked to GitHub.  The project on GitHub will have several branches, including the Dev, Staging and Master.  When they are ready they merge the dev branch with staging and then eventually with Master.  When the code is merged with Staging, TeamCity detects this and pushes the changes to the Staging server, and then the same with the Master which pushes through to the Live site.  This is all automated once the dev has used git merge.  Is there a way I can do this with Amazon?  I've been looking at CodeDeploy but the tutorial I found was quite hands on and you needed to enter a commit ID whenever you wanted it to update.  I'm looking to get rid of TeamCity as I think it's unnecessary, I'm sure AWS can do this but I just don't know how.

At the minute I'm using autoscaling.  Would I need to somehow push the changes to an image and then use this to create the new instances?

Hi,

When learning about AWS I used a host of different resources listed below:

I used the AWS CSA video course from linuxacademy which I managed to get for a good price from www.udemy.com which was a great help and showed in depth how to set up different services, detail on how they work and good examples to resolve issues for troubleshooting, highly recommend this! It covers all 4 elements that you listed on your post

I also looked at a lot of the deep dive videos on youtube submitted by Amazon themselves for different services which allowed me to get a deeper understanding of different elements, some of the information was greater detail than I needed, but well worth it

I also looked at the whitepapers from the AWS website, a great source of information and I would look at the ones that are listed in the AWS CSA Blueprint - http://awstrainingandcertification.s3.amazonaws.com/production/AWS_certified_solutions_architect_associate_blueprint.pdf

From the command you supplied I can see that the ssh command is trying to use ""my_aws_key.pem"" as the host name during the connection attempt.  When specifying the identity file (my_aws_key.pem) you must use the -i switch.  Your command should therefore look like this:

Amazon EC2	"Re: HTTP Occassionally Not Responding
Whenever you stop an instance it will lose its Public IP. To retain an IP you will need to get an Elastic IP, but even then it might lose the IP association when you stop it, but you can always set it again.

IIS will stop the W3 Worker Process after x minutes inactivity. When that happens you will get a pause while it starts up again when traffic is received on the configured port(s). 

Also, if your instance is getting LOTS of traffic (specifically that traffic which you don't want it to receive) then you will have issues. Not forgetting it's not a mega instance, so you will only be able to deal with lots of traffic on a ""burst"" basis.

Cloudwatch will tell you more about what's happening on the poor instance. You can access it very quickly by way of the Monitor tab in your console for the server(s). If you see the charts hitting a ceiling value then that's likely a limit being reached."

Hi there,

I am having some difficulties setting up an instance with a custom kernel. I've searched online and followed all of the instructions I found but unfortunately no luck.

I try bundling the image, uploading, booting a new EC2 instance and everything works fine. However, the problem comes in after I install a custom kernel. To do this, I boot a local guest VM using qemu and install a custom kernel (inside the guest), modify the GRUB file accordingly (to reflect the new kernel and initrd), bundle and upload the image and create an instance using that AMI. These steps are not a problem, however, the instance does not boot. Looking at the AWS console log for the instance, it seems like the kernel never boots. I've tried a number of configurations, enabling all the Xen modules necessary but still no luck. Any idea what could be the issue or how I could further debug the issue? Attached is the log from the AWS console. The tpmfront occur even when the kernel is unchanged. Thanks for your help!"

Hi lukemat,

I understand you have received an e-mail that your EC2 instance is scheduled for retirement. Upon reviewing your AWS Account, it appears the instance ID in which is scheduled for retirement is i-3b3d0214. Upon reviewing this EC2 instance, it does appear the underlying-host is experiencing an issue. If this is the correct instance in question, the EC2 instance i-3b3d0214 is EBS-backed and does not have any instance-store volumes. Since you are using an EBS-backed instance, and do not have any instance-store volumes attached, please perform a 'stop' and 'start' on the EC2 instance so it can migrate to a new healthy underlying-host. 

Since you are not using an Elastic IP address, the public IP address will change on your EC2 instance when you perform a 'stop' and 'start' action.  For more information on Elastic IPs, please see the following AWS documentation -- Elastic IPs

Amazon EC2	"How fault-tolerant are Elastic Load Balancers?
We have had sporadic problems with instances in the past that turned out to be related to AWS back-end hardware (or at least something like that), so I got to thinking about the rest of our AWS infrastructure and wanted to ask:

Does anyone know how (if at all) fault-tolerant the Elastic Load Balancers are? I'm guessing they don't run on exactly the same technology as the EC2 instances but if anyone has any information on what kind of redundancy etc they use I would appreciate it."
Amazon EC2	"Re: How fault-tolerant are Elastic Load Balancers?
They run on EC2 instances in an autoscale group with at least 2 instances running the AWS ELB application, with automated Route53 DNS load balancing w/healthchecks.  There is some special logic to sequester IPs assigned to ELBs after they are retired to prevent reuse in short order. There might be some extra autoscale group logic to change the instance-types in addition to instance-count.

When you nslookup an ELB you'll see at least two ip addresses, representing the two ELB hosts.

So, a given ELB will be as reliable as any pair of instances that are on short-ttl DNS loadbalancing can be assuming AWS has very good monitoring and error-catching.

I have seen cases where an ELB will encounter some combination of scaling / failed nodes that cause it to fail for a short period of time, but recovers quite quickly. The more traffic you have the more ELB instances you'll have, reducing the chance they will all encounter a problem at the same time."

Amazon EC2	"Wrong pem on AMI
Hello,

I have a problem on my current server: for some reason the pem key doesn't work anymore.
(I suppose developer changed something wrong)
I'm creating an AMI, running a new instance starting by this AMI, creating a new keypair to use with this instance, but I still get the error:

Permission denied (publickey).

Looks like the new created key pair is not replacing the old (wrong) one.
Could you please suggest me a workaround?

Thank you."
Amazon EC2	"Re: Wrong pem on AMI
On Windows the Admin Password is encrypted using the PEM. So if the Admin Password has been changed then it doesn't matter what PEM is used, you just use known credentials.

For Linux, I'm a bit vague on the whole Linux scene, a similar pattern is followed. If you have the original PEM then you will need to use that rather than creating a new keypair. The instance was created using a key and this is what is needed to access it. If you do not have the key any more then create a user, or reset the root credentials, or create a new SSH Authentication Key to use... But do it from the server."
Amazon EC2	"EC2 reboot issue
Hi, 
Last month Amazon scheduled maintenance for some of our instances.   After that, we found that the EBS devices are mounted as the root.   Do you know why?  We detached the EBS and reboot again, then the local /dev/sda1 will be mounted as root ""/"".

However, after the detaching and reboot, the public and private IPs are all changed. From here http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-reboot.html, they are not supposed to be changed.

Hi,

I would start by taking a look at the link below to understand it a little first:

It a nutshell the following steps are required:
-Launch the AWS Management Console.
-Create and uniquely name your Load Balancer.
-Select the protocol(s) to manage via the Load Balancer (HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, and SSL)
-Configure health checks for the Load Balancer.
-Select the instances that you wish to place behind the Load Balancer.
-Traffic to the DNS name provided by the Elastic Load Balancer is automatically distributed -across your load balanced, healthy Amazon EC2 instances.

Amazon EC2	"Re: How to do Load Balancing the EC2 Instance?
Yeah, Here is my clear picture. 

QUESTION : 01
My EC2 instance runs the application on Apache Tomcat and Restlet Framework. The Restlet application handles request from the client to accessing S3Bucket, SNS and DynamoDB services. If I try to achieve Load Balancing on my instance, will it require to separate the services like S3Bucket, SNS, DynamoDB into an individual instances?

QUESTION : 02
In Load Balancing, If the request reaches 80% throughput, then a new instance(named as ""new_instance"") will create and handles the request. How about the settings of the new instance? Will it re-use my configuration settings which is used in old instance OR we have to create every time new configuration file?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: How to do Load Balancing the EC2 Instance?
Hi,

Q1) - No you wont need to seperate the services, the ELB will simply pass the incoming traffic from your clients to your availabile instances, typically on a 'round-robin' approach.  It will just pass the request to your instance as if the ELB wasnt actually there so your instance will work as it does now.

Q2) - I think here you are referring to Autoscaling rather ELB.  Autoscaling works well with ELB, but the scenario described below would be performed by your Autoscaling group and configuration.  As a part of the Autoscaling setup you will be required to enter the instance type and AMI, and other congiruation details that you want launched when your thresholds are met.  As a part of this you are able to enter 'user-data' which allows you to run scripts which will download your latest code etc to your application. 

More information on Autoscaling can be found here:

Regards,
Aramintag."
Amazon EC2	"Re: How to do Load Balancing the EC2 Instance?
Hi,

Having autoscaling setup allows AWS to automatically spin and shut down EC2 instances as and when required based upon your requirements and thresholds.  

It enables your infrastracture to elastically scale up and down with the demands of your applications to handle the required load effectively without manual intervention.  

For example, when your Tomcat EC2 instance reaches a CPU usuage of 75% (this can be any % you want) you want to add another instance to help with the load.  Autoscaling will spin up another EC2 instances, based off of a predefined AMI (that you select during autoscaling configuration) and add it to your autoscaling group.  combined with ELB, traffic will then be sent to both instances.  When the CPU usage then drops again to a more managable level, Autoscaling will automatically terminate one of the EC2 instances bringing it back down to one, and therefore saving your money.  

So, autoscaling takes out manual intervention of implementing additional resources when you need them.  It saves you money by terminating instances when you dont need them and its elasticity enables great scaleability for your application and infrastructure should your load steadily rise or decrease.

It is OBVIOUS what's going on. Do you think you're fooling anyone?

 These are underhanded tactics to confuse customers and keep them in the dark about when they will start being charged.  It's despicable, and combined with the flagrant tolerance of counterfeit items being sold on Amazon, really leaves a sour taste. Not one Samsung phone charger I could find was legitimate. Ugh.

Amazon EC2	"Re: Initial Sign Up Date
Hi there Black Salamander,

The reason that we advise to contact CS and send more information over PM is that account information is sensitive and to ensure that we maintain our agreed levels of security on sensitive information there is very little that we are going to put in a public forum about a customer's account.

I pulled up the email that I got when I was approaching the end of my free tier period. The email is sent 4 weeks before the trial period expires, it advises when the trial period expires and it also contains information and links about pricing and your bill. I have attached a sanitised version for your perusal, the email comes from no-reply-aws@amazon.com.

I will concede that there is no easy way to simply look up a field that gives you this information and I have created a feature request for the billing console to get this information added. The current method that you can use is to go through your bill monthly history as the email suggests and look for line items labeled ""free tier""

Unfortunately I cannot add anything further to your comments on the Amazon retail site as my level of access to that is the same as yours. I would however recommend that you follow through with your complaint and report it to the retail Amazon.com site so that they can try to help your situation. I would also recommend that you create new threads on this forum with your concerns so that they can be addressed in a timely manner.

If you require any further clarification feel free to PM me so I can provide you with information without compromising the confidential information of any customers."

I'm experiencing problems that seem to be related to Ubuntu 14.04 using an older version of ec2-api-tools and awscli:
The tools work fine, unless I want to use them on region eu-central-1.

A simple:
ec2-describe-snapshots --aws-access-key [key] --aws-secret-key [secret key] —region eu-central-1

throws a

aws configure set default.ec2.signature_version v4

Hello AWS Community,

My question surrounds snapshot to S3 costs, such as;

Take a 1024GB SSD EBS volume with 10% daily change. Does the frequency of snapshots drive up the cost (i.e. daily vs monthly)? If so, why?

Same sized EBS volume again, but now there is 0% daily change to it.  For the daily/month snapshots what am I being charged now? Has the cost stayed the same due to no incremental blocks to snapshot?

I understand the benefits of EBS snapshots more often, but my current cost estimate will face a lot of cost focused challenge. Which is why I want to be very clear on the difference between the snapshot time frames.

Thank you for you time,"
Amazon EC2	"Re: EBS Snapshot to S3 costs
Hello,

You are only charged for the amount of data that has been captured in the snapshot and thus stored in S3.  The frequency of snapshots is immaterial.

Regarding the data captured, this is indeed incremental data.  Depending on usage, your snapshots may capture any percentage of changed data (including 0%), but the frequency does not weigh in at all in your charges (again, we charge on overall snapshot storage for the account in a region).  Be warned that we do have limits on the amount of snapshots that a particular account can accrue, but this can be modified if necessary:

http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html#limits_ebs

Additionally, snapshot data is compressed, so a 10% change on a 1024TiB EBS volume that has had a snapshot created will generate a snapshot stored in S3 that is considerably smaller than the ~100GiB expected.

Amazon EC2	"Faster throughput for a TURN / Proxy Server on EC2 instance
Hi all! we are currently developing an application based on WebRTC and are trying to host a TURN server (which acts like a proxy server) using the EC2 service.

I know it has been for a while since this thread started but I will reply this in case anyone is listening.

The solution to this problem is to create a new ssh key in dropbear and add it to your Amazon instance accepted keys.

$ssh-keygen -t rsa
Copy the file contents of the file id_rsa.pub to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file in a new line.

Now log in using this key

Hello,

Could you please confirm if your spot instances were using PV based AMI or HVM AMI?
If the instances were using PV-Based AMI, then when you created the AMI from the snapshot, you missed to specify the PV-GRUB/AKI or would have left it to default. This might create issue.

If you were using HVM based instances, then you need not specify the AKI like mentioned above.  If you are running an HVM AMI, then can you stop the instance and change the root EBS volume attachment name to /dev/xvda instead of /dev/sda1 and give it a try?

Hi,

I took a look at your instance and in the System Logs I see the following:

mkdir: `/root/.ssh': Permission denied
chmod: cannot access `/root/.ssh': Permission denied
grep: /root/.ssh/authorized_keys: Permission denied
/usr/local/sbin/get_ec2_creds.sh: line 17: /root/.ssh/authorized_keys: Permission denied
chmod: cannot access `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys': Permission denied

It seems like the instance is having issues accessing the .ssh folder. Do you recall modifying the permissions on that folder? I would recommend attaching the root volume to a healthy instance you have access to and ensuring the directory has the necessary permissions.

Amazon EC2	"Re: can't start my instance
-SOLVED-

The initial spot instance was a PV based AMI. The snapshots made during its lifetime were missing an important file: /boot/grub/menu.lst (is this by design?). The instance started from an AMI made from a snapshot, even it was the correct type (PV + the right AKI), did not boot because pv-grub missed the information necessary to load the right user kernel. The solution was to create /boot/grub/menu.lst:

###
default 0
timeout 0

title EC2-xen
root (hd0)
kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.18-164.0.0.0.1.el5xen ro root=/dev/sda1 console=hvc0
initrd /boot/initrd-2.6.18-164.0.0.0.1.el5xen.img
###

You can find the right kernel and initrd files in /boot.

http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/UserProvidedKernels.html

An interesting thing to notice is that the instance (which is a xen domU) has no grub package installed! That's because pv-grub runs on the xen dom0.

http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/DomU

Scott, those errors came from the amazon custom /etc/init.d/dbora, which calls /usr/local/sbin/get_ec2_creds.sh twice: first time as root and the second time as $ORACLE. The last has no permissions to access /root. I commented the /usr/local/sbin/get_ec2_creds.sh line.

Hello,

I'm not new to Unix or firewalls, but I'm having trouble with the ""security groups.""  Connecting is fine via SSH, but when I try to allow HTTP traffic, nothing works.

What I did: I made a new security group called ""webserver."" For inbound, set type to HTTP, protocol TCP, port 80, Source ""anywhere"" 0.0.0.0/0.

From the EC2 instance I can telnet to port 80 and talk to the webserver, but I can't do so from over the network. The webserver logs show only my localhost test connection.

I also created an ICMP ""security group"", allowing all ICMP types, from anywhere.  And yet I can't ping the box.  Clearly that's wrong.

What's happening?

Amazon EC2	"Re: help with ""security groups""
Sounds like you're looking in the wrong place. The next place to look would be a local firewall (iptables?) then at the actual web server application, particularly where it's listening to and what it's bind address is. You can usually find that out with a netstat (netstat -nlp | grep 80)

Re-reading your post... You also need to associate your security group with the server, go to the EC2 management console, select your instance and it will have ""Security groups"" in the informational bit. Go edit the security group with that name.

Amazon EC2	"Re: help with ""security groups""
firefly775, thank you!!

Your second paragraph, about editing the security group associated with my instance, provided the solution.

For anyone reading: my mistake was thinking a ""security group"" was analogous to a ""firewall rule.""  So I kept adding a new ""security group"" for each rule, rather than having one group with numerous rules.

Thanks again!  Everything's working as expected now.

Enjoy your day!

Amazon EC2	"Config management in AWS
I recently started reading on various config management options for AWS platform. I came across multiple options but I'm unable to pick one yet and wanted to check how other folks are doing it.

Requirements:
	1. Need to support AWS auto scaling groups/configs 
	2. Should not store git repo locally in client nodes
	3. Manage infrasturcture as code

Option 1: Puppet
 Pros:
   - Strong expertise in Ops team, but it is difficult to get adopted in 'you build; you run' environment. 
   - It is easier to bootstrap new hosts using CloudFormation-init. 
   - So far this seems to be the best solution for bootstrapping new hosts created by AWS Auto Scaling config/group.

 Cons:
   - Tricky to get it right with certificates, but so far I got it to working in AWS.
   - Need to maintain a machine state. This tents to maintaining long-running hosts, not a bad thing.

 Open question:
   - How does this compare with other CF options, mainly Ansible & AWS OpsWorks (listed below)?
   - I have experience running puppet in large data centers, but never done in AWS. Anything that I should watch out ?

Option 2: Ansible
 Pros:
  	- Very light weight and easy to onboard users.

 Cons:
 	- Requires remote shell access to execute commands 

 Open questions:
 	- Since all commands are running executed from a central machine, will it scale ? 
 	- Can add more machines, but then how to manage the jobs ?
 	- How do I make sure hosts have correct config all the time ? Something that puppet agent does well, running in regular interval via cron.
 	- Allowing a remote shell user with sudo access to manage all the production systems doesn't sound very secure. This can be restricted by sudoers , but now how to manage the sudoers ?
 	- Was looking into Ansible & Packer integration to create immutable systems. But this means we will have to create new AMI for every little changes, how scalable and efficient is this ?


Option 3: OpsWorks

  Open question:
	- Seems to work well, but does lots of magic behind the scene. Anyone has experience running this ?
	- Does it support running sync commands locally in regular interval, like puppet agent ?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: Config management in AWS
We have a rather amateur puppet system, but it works and it works well and it's really only a few lines of code that doesn't even need thinking about once you get it running. We have an S3 bucket and a role that's allowed read-only access on every server. The AMI is a base Debian image with a simple python script to go fetch a tag from the instance meta-data, once it has that tag it can determine what ""type"" of instance it is and download the relevant manifests from the bucket. s3://{bucket-name}/prod/openvpn/ for example has 2 folders, manifests and files which are pretty self-explanatory in puppet land.

The script that runs at bootup will download and apply all the manifests, email any errors to the admin then go into ""sleep mode"" and keep an eye on whether the following file exists every 5 minutes (usually empty) 

s3://{bucketname}/prod/openvpn/update

If the file exists, it will run just like it did at the start and download any new configs and reapply the manifests.

Works for us, it's a very simple system and probably wouldn't work for bigger companies."

Amazon EC2	"Re: My instance suddenly became unaccessible
Hello,

Thanks for posting. I've reviewed instance i-aa7a3aea and ran a few tests from my instance. Currently I can successfully connect to your web server and retrieve the web page. Looking at the CloudWatch metrics the CPU and Networking In/Out look fine, but looking at the root EBS volume on this instance I can see that starting on 05/07/15 at 6:40 UTC there was a spike in read IO to the volume, 3000 IOPS, which lasted until 7:20 UTC. At this point you had exhausted the gp2 burst credits and were throttled back to the baseline of 45 IOPS.

Please review the following https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=eu-west-1#metrics:graph=!NS0!MN1!ST2!ET3!SS4!PD5!D06!E07!VAAWS/EBS~VolumeReadOps~2015-05-07T01%3A00%3A00Z~2015-05-09T16%3A29%3A46Z~Average~300~VolumeId~vol-29fd872e

I suspect this was related to the web server and SSH having issues. If you are not familiar with how gp2 volumes and burst credits work please see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html

Up until that point you were getting a steady amount of Network In and Out but I don't see much disk activity prior to that time. It might be difficult to track down now, but continue to monitor the volume and if you find the reads show large spikes again I'd try to identify what those reads are using iostat and top.

P.S.: I have port 22 open for all i.p. addresses for ssh under security groups from AWS management console

EDIT: I also tried restricting the ssh login from my i.p. only, in order to avoid some attack, and rebooted the instance. But I still get the same response.

Amazon EC2	"Re: Cannot connect to EC2 instance via ssh
Hello,

Thanks for posting. Unfortunately I couldn't locate your AWS resources based on your username. If you can provide the instance id we can look and see if there is any further information we can provide.

I believe at this point your best option will be to stop the instance, detach the root volume and attach it to another instance in the same Availability Zone that you can SSH to. Once the volume is attached to a working instance, you will then mount the filesystem to this instance and review the logs in /your-mountpoint/var/log/ for further information as to why the connection is failing. The following link describes this process:

https://aws.amazon.com/articles/5213606968661598

Also verify that you've not run out of disk space or inodes on the volume. Once the volume is mounted to the filesystem:

$ df -h
$ df -i


It's always best practice to restrict access to your SSH port. As you identified, leaving it open to the entire world invites unwanted connections which do consume resources on your instance answering these requests.

Hi.

This probably will sound like a silly topic and a stupid problem report, but I want to see if anyone else has noticed similar issues with Windows 2008 R2.

Amazon EC2	"How to prevent ELB from giving affinity
I am doing load testing on an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) with a few EC2 as controllers of RESTful traffic.  There are no cookies accepted by the test.  Instead, the test is doing identical traffic several thousand times a second using jMeter.  The autoscale group does not automatically add new EC2's, instead, update-cloudformation is called to increase the minimum number of EC2's in the autoscale group.  When scaling up, the new controllers show as healthy but no traffic is routed to them.  If the jMeter test is restart, then the new controllers get properly balanced traffic.

This system is designed to be a high-speed server-to-server interface.  I expect the behavior of jMeter to be quite similar to what we will find in production.  I assume that jMeter is using the same local TCP ports and the ELB is using the source/destination ip and port to keep the traffic flowing to the same controller.  Is there a way to turn off this feature?  Can I somehow reset the ELB routing cache (I'm guess about what this is called) after scaling up?  Could there be another explanation?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: How to prevent ELB from giving affinity
Hello, 

By default JMeter will cache DNS records, so when the ELB is updated with additional instances, the new IPs won't be seen as the DNS records are already cached. See the following for how to disable DNS caching to have JMeter work properly with ELB:
https://wiki.apache.org/jmeter/JMeterAndAmazon

Amazon EC2	"Data transfer tiers seem incorrect in AWS cost calculator
Based on the information at https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/, it seems that the price per month for outbound traffic computed by the AWS calculator at http://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html is giving incorrect results above 10000 GB/month.  For example, when changing from 10000 GB/month to 10002 GB/month, the price increases from $899.91 to $900.09, an increase of 18 cents, or 9 cents per GB.  However, the ""Data Transfer OUT From Amazon EC2 to Internet"" table at https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/ indicates that a $0.085/GB tier should be in effect at that quantity.

Am I understanding this discrepancy correctly, and, if so, which page should I rely on?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: Data transfer tiers seem incorrect in AWS cost calculator
Hi Ryan,

You are correct in what you are saying, there does seem to be a discrepancy here, and by quite a bit!

This is happening because the calculator uses a multiplier of 1024 for GB to TB conversion. e.g. 10240GB = 10TB. 

Your calculations seem to be based on 1000GB =1TB.  At 10000GB you are still charged at $0.090/GB and you won't be charged at $0.085 until you get to 10240GB.

Amazon EC2	"Re: Can't deregister AMIs or delete snapshots
Hello,

I did check the AMIs and the snapshots you mentioned. It appears to be owned by a different account owner and is shared to you privately. 

You will not be able to de-register an AMI / delete a snapshot which is owned by a different user.  If these AMIs & Snapshots are associated with the third party AMIs you purchased in the past, you can contact the corresponding vendor to get the sharing removed. For eg: SAP AMIs purchased from the SAP portal.

Amazon EC2	"Possible service disruption incident ?
Hi.
I’m performing some load tests for my clients. 
Yesterday, the 14th, we had the following possible service disruption incident:
After starting about 300 instances, and reaching about 1.7Gbps volume (as reported by the client), the load dramatically decreased to level of 5-30Mbps. I have terminated and started new instances several times, but nothing had changed. I could reach barely ~30 Mbps, and nothing  seems to change this.
All instances are m1.small, running from eu-west-1, us-east-1,us-west-2. I have a limitation of 2K instances in each of these regions. I don’t know of any other limitation I have with AWS.
If you could please investigate this important matter on your side, it might help us understand what happened.
In addition, if you could supply some general statistics regarding my account, such as total throughput per region on the 14th of April, that could also be handy.

Account 873954994440
Thanks,

Roee"
Amazon EC2	"Re: Possible service disruption incident ?
Hello,

Unfortunately, from the description there is no way to know why the load test decreased from 1.7Gbps volume (as reported by the client) to 5-30Mbps. As an educated guess, it sounds like possibly TCP congestion control / congestion avoidance behavior. For your reference, here is a detailed chapter from the book ""High Performance Browser Networking"" that describes the background:
http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000545/ch02.html

In the future, you may want to use a throughput test with a general tool like iperf3, nuttcp, NTTTCP (Windows), or so on between two of your own instances to rule out any infrastructure problem. That way, if you see unexpected values, please share the source and destination IP addresses or instance IDs and the exact commands you are running so we reproduce the behavior.

Regarding general statistics for your account, you can add up CloudWatch metrics for each instance (which are available for 2 weeks) or look at the Detailed Billing Reports:
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/detailed-billing-reports.html
Please note that EC2 provides only aggregate metrics such as NetworkIn and NetworkOut, you will need to use netstat or other OS-level tools to examine statistics such as number of packets or retransmits.

Amazon EC2	"Can't connect to my t2.micro instance
Hi

I have an Amazon WorkSpaces account with a Windows 7 machine setup and I'd like to use a zero client and the PCOIP protocol to connect to it.  I setup an EC2 instance using the ""Teradici PCoIP Connection Manager for Amazon WorkSpaces"" as the base for the instance.  The instance id is i-a8315b5e and is running with both status checks complete.  It has a public IP and dns but, I can't connect to it with the Key that was assigned to it.  I keep getting the error ""Permission denied: publickey""  I need to be able to login to the instance in order to continue the setup for the PCOIP connection.  

I have searched on this error and found a few things it could be.  One is the permission on the PEM file is not set to 400.  I tried to change permissions with Windows and that didn't help so I installed VirtualBox on my Windows machine and installed Ubuntu so I could chmod 400 the file in a native Linux environment.  I successfully changed the permissions on the file that way and tried using the terminal to login to the instance without success, same error.  The second reason had to do with converting the file for use with putty and something happening that makes the key not on one line.  I am not using putty or converting the file so I don't think that has anything to do with it.   

In the Ubuntu terminal window when trying to ssh into the instance this comes up ""ECDSA key fingerprint is dd:1d:2c:9d:ce:01:13:b9:6b:16:d2:90:d8:a2:32"".  This does not match the key fingerprint that is listed for the key in the EC2 Management Console for the key pair the instance is using but, the file I'm using is the .pem file that I downloaded when the key pair was created.  The key fingerprint listed in the EC2 Management Console is ""cb:ea:42:c9:2b:f7:8e:9f:d2:af:5d:18:8e:89:4e:3c:b4:5f:4e:11""

I am definitely in over my head a bit with this stuff but, I'm willing to learn and would appreciate a little help from those with more knowledge on the subject. 

Thank you in advance

Amazon EC2	"Re: Permission denied (publickey).
Hello,

Since you changed the permission of the user's home directory and the authorized_keys file, you will not be able to SSH to your instance as you mentioned. As you do not have a way to login to your instance and set back appropriate permissions, you will have to do this off-line.

I understand that your instance is a t2.micro instance using EBS root volume and having no instance store volumes attached. 

You can modify the permissions offline by performing the below steps. 
1. Stop the instance
2. Detach the root volume of your instance
3. Attach the volume as a data volume to any other running Linux instance in the same availability zone
4. Mount the volume
5. Set the appropriate permissions on the files and directories
6. Unmount the volume & detach it from the instance
7. Attach it back to your actual  instance as the root volume and start back your instance.

Though not exactly matching to your case, you can take a look at the below link to get an idea about how you can perform the above mentioned steps.

Amazon EC2	"Re: My server can not access the IP range 103.246.104.0/24
Hello Hai Nguyen,

I did check your instance's settings like VPC route table, VPC Network ACLs, Ingress & Egress Security groups and they look OK. There is no filter or block from the AWS side which will prevent you from accessing the mentioned IP range from your instance.

I would recommend you to review if there are any IP table or any such firewall rules which is blocking the outbound traffic from your instance to 103.246.104.0/24. Also, look for any wrong route configuration in your operating system level.  If there are no blocking firewall rules or bad routes in your instance's operating system level, then you can run a traceroute or mtr report to identify if there is any issues with any of the ISP in between.

Amazon EC2	"EBS Volume Attached, but not found in Disk Management (Windows)
Hi! We have been having problems with one of our instances, and are looking for ways to fix it as it seems that we have completely lost access to our volumes. About a month or so ago, one of our instances simply stopped starting after it was stopped one evening, and looking at the System Log it seemed to be getting stuck at the ""Waiting for metadata accessibility"" stage. Through delving through some posts, we found that changing it from m3.xlarge to c3.xlarge somehow let us at least fire up the instance, though since we had detached the volumes in attempts to fix it, only the root drive seems to be available. All other drives do not even show in Disk Management where they usually would be to set them to ""online"". The volume IDs are: _ and _. Instance ID is _. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

At this point, I have re-created an instance and am trying to rebuild with previous snapshots, but this is quite the tedious process and hope to be able to simply retrieve the old instance.

Amazon EC2	"Best way to configure Apache keep-alive timeout and ALB idle timeout?
Hi All,

I've just come across the issue described here:

https://forums.aws.amazon.com/message.jspa?messageID=307851

My Apache log is also showing a lot of these 408 responses, and I'd like to resolve this, but I'm uncertain that the issue and solution was fully described. 

It mentions that the issue may be due to the Apache connection timeout being lower than the ALB idle timeout. But in my case, I'm using the default Apache connection timeout, which I think is set at 300s, and the default ALB idle timeout, which is set at 60 seconds, so this isn't true for me.

This AWS document seems to agree/indicate that the problem is related to keep-alives, and that the keep-alive timeout should be enabled and set to greater than the idle timeout:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/config-idle-timeout.html 

I do, in fact, have my keep-alive timeout set low -- only 5 seconds. But my question is, is it actually safe to increase this to > 60 seconds? Won't this cause the Apache children to be exhausted very quickly (I have my MaxClients set to 150 because each child process has a PHP instance of about 20MB)?

If I should keep my keep-alive timeout low, is it reasonable to reduce the ALB idle timeout to < 5 seconds?

Thanks."

Amazon EC2	"Getting HTTPS to work on EC2 LAMP Setup
I recently moved an osCommerce application over to Amazon EC2, and I was in a bit of a rush because my previous site host suddenly disabled access to my shared account for consuming too many resources.

When I launched the EC2 instance, I did not specify a security group that had the Inbound Rule for HTTPS since I didn't know it was necessary at the time. I realized that trying to access my site via HTTPS was returning a ""Connection Refused"" error, and I tried to go back and add the rule for HTTPS to the security group, but the problem kept happening.

Somewhere, I read that the HTTPS rule must be set when launching an instance, or it will be impossible to access that instance via HTTPS. Does anyone know if this is true? I am a bit pressed for time since this a live application, and I'm trying to get HTTPS working again as soon as I can, so I am trying to find some sort of workaround here if it exists at all.

I am looking at this guide here: http://www.glynjackson.org/weblog/entry/installing-ssl-aws-ec2.html

Amazon EC2	"Java, HttpClient, DNS Caching and ELB Load Balancing
Hello,

I have a question regarding the interaction between a Java-based client and ELBs.

We have an all-java SOA architecture meaning that in order for one service to connect to another we use HttpClient using the ELB A Record of the service. However AFAIK Java caches DNS lookups (forever?) so I would think this would be a major issue with ELB because once the DNS is resolved to one IP it will ""burn"" that into the JVM thus causing load balancing to not work at all. 
Also, the HttpClient connection pool would also interfere with load balancing because it would keep connections open to possibly overloaded instances (these are set to timeout in 60s).
The JVMs are running in an Amazon AMI in EC2 and we're using Java Server 1.8.0_31.
Please tell me if these assumption are correct.

I have seen this issue while running JMeter tests against an ELB and the only way to get load balancing to work in that case was to turn off networkaddress.cache.ttl and use linux (the OS would also cache lookups for a while) so it would be a function of both the JVM and the OS.

If it is, would the solution be to set networkaddress.cache.ttl and networkaddress.cache.negative.ttl to 0 or some other really small number in each service? 

Do you have any advice on this matter?

Thank you

Amazon EC2	"Re: Java, HttpClient, DNS Caching and ELB Load Balancing
In regards to JMeter, since version 2.12 it provides a test element designed to allow each thread to perform DNS lookup on its own bypassing JVM and OS cache -  DNS Cache Manager. 

For testing it is quite enough just to include aforementioned test element into JMeter's test plan. If you're implementing your own code you should be able to borrow the logic from  DNSCacheManager.java class source."
Amazon EC2	"Re: Java, HttpClient, DNS Caching and ELB Load Balancing
The long dns cache of java is quite a problem for DNS-based services. I highly recommend setting networkaddress.cache.ttl to less than 60s to avoid problems."
Amazon EC2	"Re: Java, HttpClient, DNS Caching and ELB Load Balancing
Thank you for your comments. 
Our own testing showed this is indeed a problem. We would see uneven load balancing due to DNS caching where a client service would send all requests to a specific ELB instance which in turn would route traffic to a specific AZ. We didn't have cross-zone LB enabled.
Enabling cross-zone balancing addressed the issue of uneven load balancing but that still would not solve the problem of the ELB instance itself getting too many connections. Thus even if AWS auto scaled their ELBs to handle a surge in our traffic it wouldn't help until the TTLs on the clients expired which takes a long time.
Reducing the ttl is the only solution for that.
It is still not the perfect solution because of client-side connection pooling that would cache connections to a specific load balancer but it would ensure the connections in the pool are more evenly distributed and that if a new ELB comes online the pool will start using it right away."

Amazon EC2	"Re: Problem connecting to a Windows instance from a Mac
Hello,

Typically when you create a Windows instance it is not attached to a domain, so you may leave the domain field blank to connect to the local machine. The Remote Desktop application is a program that allows you to connect to any Windows machine running a Remote Desktop server even if you don't have a .rdp file for connecting to it.

To connect to the instance from any IP (via RDP) you'll need to have your security group configured to allow all traffic on port 3389 from 0.0.0.0/0 (which represents any IP address). Typically, we recommend that you only allow traffic to your instance on port 3389 from IP addresses that you know should be connecting to your instance to prevent unauthorized access of your resources."

Hello,

This sounds like there's a typo in a configuration file or script that runs on login somewhere that's running text expansion and it's trying to expand ""~ec2-keys"" when ""~/ec2-keys"" was probably meant. The difference between the two being the first is ""the home directory of the ec2-keys user"" and the second is ""the ec2-keys file or directory within the current user's home folder"". If this is preventing you from logging in to your instance successfully, I'd recommend bringing the instance offline and attaching the root volume to another instance you can access to take a look at files you may have changed to cause this error. If you're running services on the instance and can't bring it down for examination you can take a snapshot of the volume and attach it to another instance to look for a fix and then swap the volumes out when you're ready."

Amazon EC2	"Re: When does CLI for request-spot-instances will be able to accept TAGS?
Hello,

Thank you for the feature request. This could definitely be a useful feature to have and I've passed it along to our CLI team to take a look at. Unfortunately, I can't say if or when this feature may be implemented.

Alternatively, you can leverage the CLI to tag your spot instances as they come up. As part of bootstrapping your instances, you could have a script loaded on them that checks the EC2 Metadata Service (located at http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data) for the instance's ID. You can then feed this ID into a ec2-create-tags command in order to tag the instance. The instance ID can be fetched by running 'curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id' from the instance. You could roll this script into your AMI for your spot requests or feed it in as a user-data script."

Hi,

I would like to buy a reserved instance for the freebsd o.s. ( in AWS Marketplace https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00KSS55FY ).
In the past on AWS the linux o.s. has a differenti virtualization type ( paravirtual ) and freebsd needed the hvm one in order to run and it was at an higher cost like if it was a windows platform. Since now even linux has hvm, I assume that I have to buy a reservation for the Linux/Unix platform, even if the virtualization type is HVM. Is this correct ?

Hello Marc,

That's correct. You will not be able to use the new key pair you created to connect to your existing instance ""i-f8bd8fd7"". You will need to create an AMI from this instance, and then relaunch it again using the new key pair you created.

Amazon EC2	"auto-scaling database records lost?
I have a simple question about the auto-scaling,
If I set it on my server, and my server this runs the database service as well.
When the auto-scaling to create a new server, it will share the same hard disk (The first instance / home) or will create a new, from the informed AMI?
Why it creates 3 units, you agree that each can save within one database? Would result in a loss of data?

tank you"
Amazon EC2	"Re: auto-scaling database records lost?
Auto Scaling will always launch new instances from the AMI you have specified. The contents of the AMI never change, so each new instance will basically get its own hard disk in the original state. Nothing is shared between the instances. A database server should never run inside Auto Scaling as it isn't a safe place for data that you care about. Auto Scaling can throw away any instance at any time. You may want to consider RDS, which gives you a separate database server with easy backups and much more out of the box."
Amazon EC2	"Re: auto-scaling database records lost?
Thank you for answer

About RDS with it would be possible, connect new instances without turning off the main instance, and they share the same data, so that when you turn off that it in momentary use nothing will be lost?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: auto-scaling database records lost?
An RDS instance is a separate database server that can be used by all your instances in the Auto Scaling group. Instances can come and go in the Auto Scaling group, but they will always have a common database server to talk to, meaning that all your data is safely stored in RDS no matter what happens in Auto Scaling. Any existing database can be transferred to RDS when you set it up."
Amazon EC2	"Re: auto-scaling database records lost?
Thank you again for your willingness to help me.

Okay, that part I understand.

What would like to know is this, if you have an RDS server (POSTGRESQL)
in a t2.small machine (Server 1), and at times hight traffic application, 
you want to connect another t2.larger (Server 2) to access the same data from (Server 1).

Whereupon the server 1 available 100% of the time.

And after a few hours turn off Server 2 without losing any data."
Amazon EC2	"Re: auto-scaling database records lost?
So you're asking about how to scale the database? For RDS PostgreSQL specifically, you can scale up to a larger instance (some downtime expected) or add read replicas (""read only"" obviously). Scaling the database may be a bit harder compared to scaling the EC2 servers running your frontend. RDS doesn't perform any scaling activities itself. You would normally have the capacity you need, and then you could expand it ahead of a christmas rush or something, but scaling will probably not occur hourly or daily as with the EC2 fleet."

Amazon EC2	"Newbie question - On Demand Instance
Hi

Hope this is in the right forum.

I want to migrate a VM to EC2 and use this to host an ""under maintenance"" scaled down version of a website when our on premises data centre is down for maintenance.

So I expect to only use this 3 or 4 times a year, for a few hours each time.

So if I migrate the VM to an on demand instance - a one time only migration. 
Then I plan to turn off the instance - and only turn on when I need it.
Q1. Is the instance saved and ready for me to turn on whenever I need it.
Q2. Am I only charged for periods when the server is 'on'.

Thanks for looking

ncff wrote:

Saved, yes. Ready to turn on? Well, probably. When you start an on-demand instance, there needs to be capacity available. That is usually the case, but it is possible that there is a shortage in the zone for some reason. A stopped instance is not associated with any hardware. The system will try to find a physical machine once you start the instance again.

Q2. Am I only charged for periods when the server is 'on'.

You won't be paying the hourly cost for the instance itself, but there are other things to consider as well:

The default public IP address is assigned dynamically and you will get a new one every time you start the instance back up. You can optionally replace it with a static IP address, called Elastic IP. That static address is free as long as the instance is up and running, but there is a small hourly charge when the instance is turned off and the static IP address is ""unused"". But maybe you can simply grab the current dynamic IP each time you launch the instance.

While the instance is in the stopped state, you will still be charged for the allocated storage."
Amazon EC2	"EC2 platform performance difference
I have two different AWS accounts and have similar EC2 free-tier instances in them (apart from paid instances in these two accounts). Both the instances are in us-east-1e availability zone in N.Virginia. ID of instance 1 is i-1e2137f4 and ID of instance 2 is i-43e7bcbe. 

I installed same set of PHP programs in these instances. While the programs give response times in order of 20 milliseconds on instance 1, the response times are much higher in the order of 4 to 8 seconds in instance 2. The time is taken by the PHP programs running on the instance 2 and there are no network operations involved here.

We checked differences from all perspectives and find no difference in terms of software configurations between these two instances. 

Are we missing anything here from instance perspective? What could be the difference leading to this drastic performance difference? Is there any problem with our instance 2?

There's a number of factors that could cause differences in performance.

One thing you do need to know is that AZ us-east-1e for one AWS account may not necessary be the same physical AZ us-east-1e for another AWS account; they are randomized as to how they are mapped logical > Physical when the AWS account is created, no doubt to help balance the load in each AZ.
