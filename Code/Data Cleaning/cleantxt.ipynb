The difference is whether requests are distributed evenly among the Availability Zones or the instances. Suppose you have 2 instances in one Availability Zone and 10 instances in another. Without cross-zone load balancing, the 2 instances would receive as many requests as the 10 instances. With cross-zone load balancing, the requests will be distributed among all 12 instances without regard for their Availability Zone.

This process is done by downloading batches of about 800-900GB of data at a time to the C4 instance and then re-uploading them into Glacier. Now, the download rates are fine (usually just a few hours at several dozen MB/s), however the upload takes absolute ages (several days at only a few KB/s). Like the current batch has taken more than 6 days and still isn't done.  Speed isn't an issue when we upload from our premisses, where 1TB takes about 3-4 days at less than 6MB/s.

Like you mentioned, the surge queue metric shows the requests being queued on the ELB. This happens when the backend instances are not accepting more requests and thus these requests get queued up at the ELB. This leads to latency.  If the request count goes over 1024, then these requests get dropped; which can be seen in the spill over count graph.  The backends may refuse to accept new request due to several reasons like over CPU utilization, max connections reached, application errors.  Requests being queued may cause latency, client experiencing high response time and if there are spill overs then requests are dropped.

However, I'm not able to find the actual rate of API calls per minute, is there such a list so that I can add some delay between subsequent calls?  thanks, Sean\", \"Re: API rate limit Hello Sean,  The Amazon EC2 API actions are divided into the following categories:  -> Describe actions, such as DescribeInstances and DescribeVolumes. These requests simply retrieve cached data, so they have the highest request limit. -> Modify actions, such as RunInstances and CreateVolumes. These requests create or modify resources, so they have a lower request limit than describe calls. -> The CreateKeyPair, GetConsoleOutput AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress, and RevokeSecurityGroupIngress actions. These requests take the most time and resource to complete, so they have the lowest request limit.  If an API request exceeds the API request rate for its category, the request returns the RequestLimitExceeded error code. To prevent this error, ensure that your application doesn't retry API requests at a high rate. You can do this by using care when polling and by using exponential backoff retries.

mentioned the surge queue metric shows the requests being queued on the elb this happens when the backend instances are not accepting more requests and thus these requests get queued up at the elb
