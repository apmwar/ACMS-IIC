The IP address of the DNS server is always the base of the VPC network range plus two; however, we also reserve the base of each subnet range plus two. For VPCs with multiple CIDR blocks, the IP address of the DNS server is located in the primary CIDR. For more information, see Amazon DNS Server.\\n10.0.0.3: Reserved by AWS for future use.\\n10.0.0.255: Network broadcast address.

From the documentation, I gather that it should be able for a lambda located inside a VPC to conduct any traffic to instances inside the same VPC.

This part worked wel before the lambda was in a VPC, apparently it went the long way around.\\nNow there's some new requirements, and the lambda also needs to send events to a JMS broker hosted on an EC2 instance.\\n\\nMy current configuration:\\n\\nThe lambda is in the same VPC as the JMS broker and the rest service.\\nThe lambda has access to all subnets in the vpc.\\nThe lambda has both AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole and AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole \\nThe lambda has all outbound connections open for its security group (All ports to 0.0.0.0/0)\\nThe lambda has no inbound rules (getting replies to outgoing requests shouldn't require inbound rules, right?)\\nThe lambda is attempting to reach the load balancer via its AWS URL (<service>.<availabilityzone>.elasticbeanstalk.com) on http.\\nThe lambda is attempting to reach the broker via a url mapped to the AWS URL of the broker by route53.\\nThe JMS broker has an inbound rule for the lambdas security group.\\nThe load balancer is completely open on port 80.\\n\\n\\nNone the less, I'm getting timeout exceptions when sending REST-requests, and my JMS messages vanish into nirvana.

I thought they would resolve to a private IP inside the VPC like normal instances, but the only way to get at them seems to be to go the long way around. Which from the lambda would require a NAT, which is prohibitively expensive if you need it just for that. \\nSo I guess I'll just have to take the lambda out of the vpc again and route the events through the REST API instead of sending them to the JMS broker directly.

the vpc router.\\n10.0.0.2: reserved by aws. the ip address of the dns server is always the base of the vpc network range plus two; however, we also reserve the base of each subnet range plus two. for

however, it doesn’t support pfs when azure works as initiator.\\naws vpn supports dpd, whereas azure policy based vpn doesn\\'t support dpd but route based does support dpd. \\nazure route based vpn

load balancing services unfortunately at this time elastic load balancing service does not support udp this is on the road map and our service team is already working on this however i cannot provide you an eta on when this will be released you can keep yourself updated on the latest news of aws https://awsamazoncom/new/ https://awsamazoncom/blogs/aws/ one possible workaround may be to use a third party load balancer from one of the solutions offered in aws marketplace we wouldn’t be able to recommend a specific third party vendor please check out the marketplace solutions here: https://awsamazoncom/marketplace another workaround may be to use route 53 and configure roundrobin dns you can use weighted routing mechanism with equal weights to your servers which routes the

way amazon can hold 100% of those profits as opposed to some type of split for using a software vpn virtual appliance etc there's still going to be a lot of profit margin for aws to have a redundant option built in for a fee without going through some third party vendor or application really looking to see ikev2 put in place because ikev1 is depreciated and out of date aws doesn't fall under that

went the long way around now there's some new requirements and the lambda also needs to send events to a jms broker hosted on an ec2 instance my current configuration: the lambda is in the same vpc as the jms broker and the rest service the lambda has access to all subnets in the vpc the lambda has both awslambdabasicexecutionrole and awslambdavpcaccessexecutionrole the lambda has all outbound connections open for its security group all ports to 0000/0 the lambda has no inbound rules getting replies to outgoing requests shouldn't require inbound rules right the lambda is attempting to reach the load balancer via its aws url <service><availabilityzone>elasticbeanstalkcom on http the lambda is attempting to reach the broker via a url mapped to the aws url of the broker by route53 the jms broker has an inbound rule for the lambdas security group the load balancer is completely open on port 80 none the less i'm getting timeout exceptions when sending restrequests and my jms messages vanish into nirvana can anybody see something i'm doing wrong based on my configuration edited by: jedidia on feb 27 2019 5:53 am\", \"re: lambda in vpc cannot talk to anybody in same vpc ok i figured it out the jms connection simply didn't work because of a stupid typo in one of the lambdas environment variables the connection to the api didn't work because i hadn't realised that outward facing load balancers cannot be reached from inside the vpc i thought they would resolve to a private ip inside the vpc like normal instances but the only way to get at them seems to be to go the long way around which from the lambda would require a nat which is prohibitively expensive if you need it just for that so i guess i'll just have to take the lambda out of the vpc again and route the events through the rest api instead of sending them to the jms broker directly pitty\", \"subnets associated with a route table show as not associated with any rt i have 2 subnets 1 public 1 private and three route tables: 1 private rt 2 public rt 3 main rt on the vpc dashboard when i click route tables in the leftcolumn navigation then select any route table i see the subnet it's associated with the main route table is not associated with any subnet as it is just there as a catchall default route table immediately beneath seeing what the subnet associated with the route table i see a message the following subnets have not been explicitly associated with any route tables and are therefore associated with the main route table however the subnets listed there are definitely explicitly associated with a route table so what why am i seeing that message\", \"re: subnets associated with a route table show as not associated with any rt a subnet is always going to be associated with a route table if you don't explicitly it it will use whatever rt is set as the main =yes for the respective vpcbut if you don't explicitly set it via subnetsroute tablesedit subnet association and choose the rt

you're having is occurring because the ovpn files aws generates are invalid you need to copypaste the starfield technologies ca cert into the ovpn file as the first entry under the <ca> section\", \"re: aws client vpn doesn't connect the comment regarding prepending a random string at the beginning of the dns endpoint address is accurate i just used 'random' it's shown as *cvpnendpoint substitute random or any other random set of characters in place of the *  so mine is randomcvpnendpoint i'm using mutual authentication and have had no trouble with the generated ovpn file although it needs some modifications 1 change the endpoint name per above 2 follow the instruction in the attached doc to add the cert and the key into the ovpn file it's similar to the user docs in aws but
