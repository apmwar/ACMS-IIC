Amazon EC2	"Very high I/O requests under EBS category
We have been having memory utilization issues (too high), we have been basically shut down to focus on the problem therefore there is almost zero visitors on site. However, the I/O requests are so high, it generates a bill of  almost $100/month alone. We are trying to figure out what might cause the problem, if you can help pointing out the potential causes that would be great!

If you want to find out which process is actually performing high IO operations on your volumes, I would recommend you to track this down using utilities like iotop. It will give you the read and write operations performed by each process in your system.

Amazon EC2	"Issues utilizing two Elastic IPs on one ec2 instance
I have two Elastic IPs that I am attempting to attach to an ec2 that has two network interfaces however only one (at a time) is responsive.

A few weeks previous I had done the same - I set up up an ec2 to serve as DNS/web/email for my small business. As I am not concerned about redundancy at the moment I put both NS records, each with their own IP, on that instance. I was able to utilize both of the IP addresses and they went to the same ec2 instance.

I decided to migrate from the Amazon AMI to Ubuntu which I am more comfortable with so I brought up a new instance and reconfigured from the existing server.

Once that was all done I allocated a second network interface to that ec2 and mapped the two Elastic IPs there.

Only one of them responds. For example, at a point where the last one I attached was on eth1, here is a tcpdump on eth0:

karldotm@ip-xxx:~$ sudo tcpdump -ni eth0

Amazon EC2	"Re: Issues utilizing two Elastic IPs on one ec2 instance
Hello karldotm,

The behavior that you are seeing in your machine is an expected behavior due to assymetric routing issue. In Amazon Linux, when you have multiple ENIs with public IP, the required routing rules are added by the ec2-net-utils package. However, in Ubuntu, you will have to configure the routing rules manually. If you do not configure those rules, you will only be able to connect through the default interface..

This article will provide you more information on how you can avoid assymetric routing issues in  a Linux server.

Amazon EC2	"Is root certificate required for SSL on ELB?
The SSL installation docs here are a little vague on whether a root certificate is required.

When I purchased a RapidSSL cert, it came with the intermediate RapidSSL certificate. However I had to go online to hunt down the self-signed root from GeoTrust Global CA.

I installed the intermediate and root together as a chain. Now the GeoTrust SSL checker says, ""Root installed on the server. For best practices, remove the self-signed root from the server.""

I wondered if maybe ELB is different--whereas Apache (for example) might already have the GeoTrust root, ELB is not really a server so I need to include the root in the chain? Or should I remove the root as suggested by GeoTrust?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: Is root certificate required for SSL on ELB?
Hello,

As per the last section in the documentation you linked to - Intermediaries that are not involved in the trust path must not be included. If included, the chain must end with your CA’s root certificate.

Thanks for your reply. 

You're right:  that section of the document says that the chain ""must end with your CA's root certificate.""

However, earlier in the document, under 3. Certificate chain in PEM Format, it says, ""To create your own certificate chain file, include the intermediate certificates and optionally, the root certificate, one after the other without any blank lines.""

Hence my confusion:  is it optional, or must it be included? What is the benefit one way or the other?

Amazon EC2	"Re: Is root certificate required for SSL on ELB?
In addition, All that certificate checker means that when performing the scan its reading that the server is radiating out the SSL certificate > the intermediates > and the Root. There is nothing wrong with this as the clients when making the SSL connection to that website or service are in charge of rationalizing out what it needs in terms of chain certificates to perform a trust Handshake in the SSL connection. 

Certificate checkers Will only show and spout out what they are programed by design. Technically its fine to radiate out the root and include it in the chain depending on the servers system and in some cases it is required to have it on certain server systems.

Hopefully someone will have an answer for us soon?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: ssh: connect to host [ip] port 22: Operation timed out
Hi,

Thank you for posting your question on AWS Forums and elaborating the issue in detail.

The ""Write error: Broken pipe"" is caused because of inactive or idle SSH connections which are normally disconnected by the server after a certain period of time. This usually depends on how the SSH server is configured, and upon disconnection the SSH client will be prompted with a message.

You could set either ServerAliveInterval in /etc/ssh/ssh_config of the client machine or ClientAliveInterval in /etc/ssh/sshd_config of the server machine. Try reducing the interval if you are still getting the error.

In Linux this could be set globally in /etc/ssh/ssh_config or per-user in ~/.ssh/config. 

For the client, edit your ~/.ssh/config (or /etc/ssh/ssh_config) file as follows for Linux:
It could also be used in the command line as an argument as in the following example;

ssh -o ServerAliveInterval=100 user@example.com

Host *
  TCPKeepAlive yes
  ServerAliveInterval 120

This fix doesn't require root or administrator access to the server and it can be applied to all SSH connections instead of just to a specific server.

This keeps the connection active even if the user is actually idle. This could be done by using the ServerAliveInterval option where the SSH client will send a null packet to the server over a set period of time just to keep the connection alive.

The following option will send the packet every 100 seconds;
ServerAliveInterval 100

For SSH server:

With administrator / root access, the option could just be disabled in the server. Set the related options in the global SSHd configuration file as the following, and restart the SSHd service.

ClientAliveInterval 30
TCPKeepAlive yes 
ClientAliveCountMax 99999

TCPKeepAlive - Specifies whether the system should send TCP keepalive messages to the other side. If they are sent, death of the connection or crash of one of the machines will be properly noticed. However, this means that connections will die if the route is down temporarily, and some people find it annoying (The default is 'yes').

ServerAliveInterval - Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the server, ssh(1) will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the server. The default is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the server.

ClientAliveCountMax – This indicates the total number of checkalive message sent by the ssh server without getting any response from the ssh client. Default is 3.

ClientAliveInterval – This indicates the timeout in seconds. After x number of seconds, ssh server will send a message to the client asking for response. Default is 0 (server will not send message to client to check.).

In Linux, /etc/ssh/sshd_config normally is the configuration file and the service could usually be restarted by the following command;

sudo service sshd restart

For the ""Operation timed out"" error, it is usually the firewall which play a role, the next time when you see the error please share the results of the following:

ping server_address
traceroute server_address
ssh -v login_name@server_address

I hope the above information helps.

Thank you,
Amit"
Amazon EC2	"Re: ssh: connect to host [ip] port 22: Operation timed out
Hello AmitR,

Thank you for the detailed reply. I tried the client-side fixes you listed...

Attempt - I could not reduce the intervals of ServerAliveInterval (in ssh_config) and ClientAliveInterval (in sshd_config), because the settings did not have values assigned to them. The comments within stated their default values were 0. I set the ServerAliveInterval to 120 and left ClientAliveInterval alone.

Result - The behavior remains the same. After what seemed to be the same period of time, it returns: ""Operation timed out"".

Please note that I could not follow the next few steps that require me to change settings on the server side as I have no ability of maintaining a connection to my instance. Therefore, I did not attempt the proposed server-side fixes.

Attempt - To try and solve the firewall problem, I decided to try a foolproof method. I used my dad's laptop (OS X). The laptop is only used for browsing the web, so there is next to no protection software. The firewall was disabled by default.

Result - Same issue. After some time, it displays ""Operation timed out"".

I attached a screenshot of my Terminal window displaying the results from following your last set of instructions.

To rule out the possibility that this may be a network issue, I connected to a public network in my area and tried to connect to my instance. The same problem persists: ""Operation timed out"".

Furthermore, I tried to connect to my instance from my Windows machine, which is connected to the Internet modem via an Ethernet cable. It also has no antivirus, and I made sure to disable the firewall. After some time, PuTTy displays a new window with the error: ""Network error: Connection timed out"".

Hello again,

Thank you for the confirmation and the suggestion Matias.

Since my account was reinstated recently, I did not have full access to all Amazon services. In essence, my account was not ""technically"" reinstated (see what I did there?). As a result, EC2 instances would not boot all the way and it hung right before starting up. Support agents noted my account as being in a state of ""isolation"" I believe.

Through Amazon's seemingly careful and excellent technical support, I was able to quickly diagnose the issue (there was a point at which there were 5 support agents on my case). Although this hiccup caused delays in services I was planning on running, I am glad I'm using Amazon. There's a gigantic safety net under everything here.Kudos to Holger B. for diagnosing the issue and Oren M. for applying a quick fix!

If anyone recently cancelled their AWS accounts, changed their minds and reinstated it, make sure you contact the support team and have everything reauthorized and back to the way it was. Problems like these could be confusing and almost impossible to fix unless you directly contact the providers.

Amazon EC2	"Common ELB, ECS Service  backend for multiple HTTPS domains
I have a case where HTTPS traffic from multiple domains need to be routed to the same set of backend ECS containers.

The ECS way is:

For domainA: create serviceA and register taskdefinitionA with imageX, container port 8000 and  ELB listener port 8000
For domainB: create serviceB and register taskdefinitionB with imageX, container port 8001 and  ELB listener port 8001

and so on , 
The main requirements of above setup are 
a)new ELB, 
b)unique port for container and ELB, 
c)new container for each service(even if it is same app).  
There is redundancy of containers and ELBs apart from port management aspects for my use case. I am exploring different options (workable or not) for completeness..  

Option1:

Terminate SSL using NGinx container. ELB does not terminate SSL and only proxies it to the Nginx container(assuming NGinx handles ELB proxy protocol).
Managing on-the-fly Nginx configuration changes across multiple Docker containers can be a pain point. 


Option2: 

Have Cloudfront terminate SSL for each domain and route plain HTTP to backend ELB.
ELB with plain HTTP stands exposed to Cloudfront (thereby internet). 
Cloudfront path incurs higher charges compared to hitting an ELB directly.     


Option3: 

Another workable solution would be to have one SSL terminating ELB per domain, each of which routes plain HTTP traffic to a common backend ECS service. This service runs 1 task definition, 1 container instance, 1 container image and port and one ELB listener port. 
This would require ELBs to be cascadable. ELB costs will double though.


Option4: 

One elegant solution is ELB supporting multiple SSL certificates via SNI.


Is ELB SNI planned to be supported or is cascading ELBs possible ? I don't see it possible from the documentation. 

This leaves only Option1 as a viable  alternative. Option2 has serious security issues. 
Options 3 and 4 may not be supported by ELB.  Are there any other possibilities?

Suggestions are most welcome.

Amazon EC2	"Please help: Instance Storage (GB)
Good day to you.
Please see attached. May I know what is Instance Storage (GB).
For the SSD 1 x 4 highlighted in yellow, what does it mean?
Thanks for your help."
Amazon EC2	"Re: Please help: Instance Storage (GB)
We generally recommend that you use instance store volumes for temporary data and EBS volumes for data requiring a higher level of durability. The data on an instance store volume persists only during the lifetime of its associated instance. If an instance reboots (intentionally or unintentionally), data on the instance store volumes will persist. However, data on instance store volumes is permanently lost under the following circumstances:

1) Failure of an underlying drive or host
2) Stopping an Amazon instance with attached instance store volumes
3) Terminating an instance

Instance store volumes are located on the underlying host hardware of the instance. When you stop an instance, the instance store disks are wiped clean. When you start the instance up again, it will be running on a different underlying host using the new host's empty instance store disks. Instance store volumes are ideal for temporary storage of information that changes frequently, such as buffers, caches, scratch data, and other temporary content, or for data that is replicated across a fleet of instances, such as a load-balanced pool of web servers. The following link describes instance store volumes and their uses in more detail: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html#using-instance-storage

You should use EBS volumes if you need to retain data after a stop/start. EBS volumes can be created in any size up to 16TB and added to any instance type at any time. You can think of EBS volumes like network attached storage versus the ""on hardware host"" storage of instance store disks. The EBS volumes will follow the instance no matter which host it resides on. The following links provide more information about EBS volumes:

http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSPerformance.html

The AMI (disk image) you choose will determine whether the root volume of your instance will be on an instance store volume or on an EBS volume. The AMI description will usually specify the root device type. In most cases you'll want to choose an AMI that uses an EBS root volume with HVM virtualization. Note that EBS volumes are charged in addition to the instance pricing:

http://aws.amazon.com/ebs/pricing/

The m3.medium instance type highlighted in your screenshot comes with 1 x 4GB instance store volume. Note that if you want to use these volumes, you'll need to specify them at launch. Block devices can only be specified during instance creation using the Block Device Mappings specified in the AMI manifest or by specifying the Block Device Mappings through the AWS web console or AWS CLI tool. Remember that anything stored on these instance store volumes should be considered temporary.

Finally, please see the following documentation for more information on the various storage options offered by AWS:

http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Storage.html

I hope this helps!

My Grub version is PV-GRUB  1.02. I try reply error with another instance with the same PV-GRUB and the error doesn't appear. The difference between instances is the SO version:
Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS doesn't work  and  Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS work fine. 

Is possible that the SO version is the problem? How I can change instance type without error?

Thank you and Best regards."

Amazon EC2	"Unterminated SSL traffic passing through ELB not reaching back-end instance
I'm running an application in a Multi-Container Elastic Beanstalk environment that should be terminating SSL connections via an NGiNX container. The SSL termination works as expected when bypassing ELB by browsing to the back-end instance directly, but I can't seem to pass the encrypted traffic through the ELB.

I'm also load balancing port 80 to the same back-end instance to verify there's not an issue with the load balancer itself.

I've tried TCP 443 -> TCP 443 and TCP 443 -> Secure TCP 443, but neither work. Running cURL hangs before receiving any type of response, similar to what I'd expect to see if a security group is blocking port 443.

I've also tried allowing all TCP traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 on both the instance's security group and the load balancer's security group, to eliminate those sorts of issues and changing from the target port 443 to 8443 (changing NGiNX's listener as well).

From the docs it seems like this should be supported, but I'm not sure where the issue could be other than incompatibilities with Docker / Elastic Beanstalk.

Any ideas?

Thanks!

Amazon EC2	"Re: Unterminated SSL traffic passing through ELB not reaching back-end instance
For anyone else who may experience this, the issue is Elastic Beanstalk related. Per EB docs, ELB only supports plaintext to backend instances even if you manually change the ELB outside of the EB console.

Setting up ELB -> ECS environment outside of EB passes unterminated SSL traffic as expected."

Amazon EC2	"Re: EC2 Network or DNS Issue?
Hi,

Thank you for posting your question on AWS Forums.

I looked at the your account details and see that you have two EC2 Windows instances running with correctly set internet gateway, security groups and network ACLs as of 09/02/2015. 

You might as well check the Windows Firewall setting to see if there was any modification in it which might have caused this. To cover more ground, I have also checked for any events in the region where your EC2 instances belong but there was none hence the possibility of any EC2 Network or DNS issue is ruled out.

I hope the above information helps.

Hello,

Thank you for the post.

I took a look at your instance: i-95f462f0 and found that this instance is consuming high CPU most of the times. As your instance seems to be over-utilized, you can resize your instance to a larger instance type with more CPU.

I'm aware of Amazon's options to terminate SSL at an Elastic Load Balancer, but I have a specific requirement to terminate SSL at the appliance I'm deploying. This is to ensure support for mutual ( client certificate ) authentication as part of the SSL handshake.

Why this 500 type of errors happening for a load balancer and how this will be reliable to my website visitors when it gives 500 type of errors when accessing the site?

How can we resolve this issue and prevent this from happening?

Amazon EC2	"Re: ALARM: ""www-sitename-com-High-Sum-HTTP-5XXs"" in APAC - Singapore
Hi there,

So there are two types of 5xx Errors reported by the ELB:

HTTPCode_ELB_5XX
and
HTTPCode_Backend_5XX

This particular alarm is firing because the ELB received a HTTP 5xx error from the backend server.
If the backend server returns a HTTP 5xx error to the ELB, the ELB will relay this error back to the client.

In this case, something occurred on the backend instance that prevented the request from being completed successfully - you'll have to investigate your application as to why it returned a 5xx error to the ELB.

Hi All,

I've got a pretty standard configuration of Amazon Linux, configured up as a webserver.  I'm in the process of setting up a Python script to fetch a Git repository using GitPython over SSH, however it would appear that the GitPython doesn't like the version of Git that Amazon Linux has available (v2.1.0) when using SSH.  Apparently using v2.3 or greater simplifies using SSH keys dramatically.

Could somebody point me to a standard repo that contains a version of Git >= v2.3?  I've already tried amzn-preview and epel.  I don't want to install from source as this needs to automatically update with a yum update command.

Hi,

we have a strange behavior for one t2.micro instance:
If you look at Credit Usage and CPU Usage, there are regular peaks of always the same amount, caused by heavy-load cronjobs running every 6 hours.

However, if I look at Credit Balance, I see an additional 3-day rythm which cannot be explained by the two other metrics:

For approx. one day, the instance accumulates Credit overall
For approx. 2 days, the instance consumes Credit overall.

On the credit balance graph, you see a steady slope up while you are accumulating credits. Every six hours you consume credits, and there's a down spike.  This is your fine sawtooth.  

As for the larger wave, I think the hint we're missing is in this doc. It says:

""Unused earned credits ... expire 24 hours after they are earned, and any expired credits are removed from the CPU credit balance at that time, before any newly earned credits are added.""

Those stair-steps down are your credits expiring, mixed with the constant slope up of earned credits.  Once they all expire down to a base level, expiration turns off again, and the slope turns up again."
Amazon EC2	"UniFi controller IP change
I have a micro instance running Ubuntu for a Ubiquiti Unifi AP controller.  I have about 12 remote sites with dozens of wireless APs that communicate with my host at AWS.  It has been working great for a couple years, then about 4 days ago Amazon changed the public IP address of the controller with no warning.  I am able to reach the controller at the new address.  The instance is running (and I am paying for it).  But, my remote devices are still configured to inform to the old address.  Is there any way to revert to the old IP address?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: UniFi controller IP change
I figured out what happened to the address of my instance and am writing what I learned in case it may help someone else.  I know it would have saved me a major headache right now if I had known.  Amazon sent me an email notice of maintenance which seemed like it would be a routine operation.  No big deal.  Buried in the complexity of their products is a core feature called Elastic IP.  The Elastic IP instance (EC2) I started was not set up by default with Elastic IP.  This is an option that has to be set up -after- the instance is created.  An EIP allows the public IP address of an instance to remain the same when the instance is rebooted or moved to another server.  Its basically a reserved (static) address for the instance.  I was operating under the misunderstanding that a product called ""Elastic Computing 2"" would have this feature enabled this by default (ie: I was paying for a reserved public IP).  It is an option buried in another menu and it there is no cost to enable it as long as the instance is running.  Once the instance is terminated, the EIP must also be terminated (IP released) or the customer pays $0.005/hr to keep the IP reserve.  This is crucial to know because AWS does not prompt the user when important changes like this are made from the console.  For instance, the console does not caution the user that stopping and starting the instance will release an IP that is not reserved or that migrating an instance with out a reserved IP will release it.  I am sure that from Amazon's perspective this is all common knowledge and well documented.  I find it is misleading to call a product Elastic Computing but not have the core feature enabled by default.  Of course tech support is not free so if you found this thread in the forums, kudos!.  I hope it helps you.  Here are the instructions I was given by a nice rep in billing to enable what I hope is now a reserved, permanent, static, public address that can be turned on and off and migrated to another instance at my discretion in perpetuity as long as I pay my bill.  If this is not the case someone just shoot me now.

I recently setup an AWS Storage Gateway VTL on EC2 and so far have been completely unable to connect to it from an iSCSI Initiator on a Windows 2012 R2 server.

I can add the IP 54.68.146.79 as a Discover Portal, which then then loads all 11 of the targets (the media changer plus 10 ""tapes"").
However, when I try to connect to any of them using default settings it hangs for about 20 seconds then comes back with ""Connection Failed"" message.

Netstat doesn't even show an attempted connection being made to the IP (or any IP on that port).

If I try to specify the Initiator and outbound IP in ""Advanced"" I can, but if I try to specify the Target Portal IP, then rather than the IP 54.68.146.79 I enter in the Discover Portal it comes back with 172.31.4.208 (an internal IP).

To verify it wasn't a firewall issue on my end I tried from a Windows 8 workstation that was completely un-firewalled (direct ethernet connection to a cable modem, after whitelisting its IP in the EC2 security group) and it had the exact same issue.

Admitted I am a complete noob to EC2, but isn't this supposed to work ""out of the box""?

I am also unable to SSH into this box from the cygwin ssh client on a separate workstation but will open a separate thread for that.

Edit: I was unable to open this separate thread due to ""message quota"" (1, really?!) but I also tried to SSH from an un-firewalled Ubuntu workstation and got the same ""Permission Denied (publickey)"" error. So I don't think it has anything to do with Cygwin.

I was able to finally get in with SSH - turns out the user to login with for the Storage Gateway is sguser, NOT root or ec2-user as the setup documentation suggests.

However, once I get in, the option to configure networking that is shown in the examples does not exist. And no way to gain access to an unfiltered command prompt that I can tell. Sudo is a no go and even a simple ls is unrecognized.

So we are still stuck with a Gateway VTL whose iSCSI devices our Windows iSCSI Initiator cannot connect to, because it is still sending back an internal IP (172.31.4.208) as the target Portal IP.

Surely SOMEONE here has run into this before!

With the documentation snafu with the sguser above, it makes me think there is probably a crucial step they left out of the setup documentation or explained poorly.

Amazon EC2	"EC2 Instance Sporadically Failing to Resolve Route53 Private DNS
I use route53 for private DNS names to use for RDS and ElastiCache. Inexplicably, these have started failing sporadically on instances in us-east-1a but seem to work in us-east-1d. Earlier this evening we deployed an updated version of our application and noticed that the autoscaling group was continuously destroying and creating instances in us-east-1a. 

These instances come up and pass health checks at first and then start failing healthchecks and die a short time later - part of the health check is to verify connectivity to RDS and Elasticache. I've SSH'd in and confirmed that when the instance first comes up it is able to resolve our private DNS properly and then it suddenly stops and begins returning errors. Note, there are no cron jobs operating on these servers, so nothing we control is happening to them on any schedule. They will also sporadically start working again and then break again.

I've tested manually creating instances, including instances with our previous AMI in us-east-1a and they all being exhibiting this issue. 

I'm at a loss for what to do next.

Update: Here's an instance exhibiting this behavior: i-4d866aed. It seems like this issue happens after either a certain amount of time or a certain number of requests as the healthcheck script checks out at first and then begins failing. When this happens in our autoscaling group, it causes the instance to die, a new one gets built, comes in service, then dies and the process starts over. Here's an example of what this looks like from doing requests at the CLI level over a few minutes:

One more quick update. When this problem occurs it only affects some of the CNAMEs in our private hosted zone. When this issue rears its head, the server is able to resolve some of the CNAMEs but not others, and it seems to come and go as to which ones are reachable and which ones are not.

Amazon EC2	"Re: EC2 Instance Sporadically Failing to Resolve Route53 Private DNS
This issue was resolved last week according to an AWS response to a colleague or mine:

Event Start Date and Time 2015-08-26 16:25 UTC Event Resolution Date and Time 2015-08-28 00:28 UTC
Summary of Issue: Between the times above, some EC2 instances in a single Availability Zone in the US-EAST-1 Region experienced intermittent incorrect responses to Private DNS queries.
AWS Actions: AWS identified that a single component was not refreshing configuration state for Private DNS domains. This component was deactivated and the service is operating normally. By 8/28/15, we will update our monitoring to detect and automatically correct any similar error in the future.
Recommended Customer Actions: None. The system is now operating normally

However, it's now occurring again and has been for the last 30 minutes or so. This time, however, it's not sporadic. Newly spawned instances in us-east-1a can't access private DNS at all.

Here's the ID of an instance exhibiting this inability to resolve Route 53 private DNS: i-0ed02bae

Amazon EC2	"Spot Fleet Launch Spec w/Security Group?
I'm trying to request a spot fleet using the AWS CLI 1.7.40.  Everything works great, except when I try to request a security group.  The aws CLI help for ""request-spot-fleet"" says the security groups should be specified this way:
                 ""SecurityGroups"": [
                   {
                     ""GroupName"": ""string"",

""SecurityGroups"": [""string"", ...],

2) If this is correct, has anyone actually gotten this to work??

Hi MCSpot,

Spot does not support specifying Subnet and SecurityGroup together in the same launchspecification. Please specify only the subnet you want to launch in and attach the security group to the instance after its launched using ModifyInstanceAttribute API (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-instance-attribute.html).

Amazon EC2	"Re: Spot Fleet Launch Spec w/Security Group?
Hi Aniruddha,
Thanks for your reply.  It seems unintuitive to me that you cannot specify a subnet & security group (firewall config) at the same time.  This certainly is possible when using request-spot-instances directly.  Here's a sample launch spec that we use with request-spot-instances without issues:

{
   ""SecurityGroupIds"" : [
      ""sg-abcd1234""
   ],
   ""ImageId"" : ""ami-abcd1234"",
   ""KeyName"" : ""some key"",

Hello,

I used a launch configuration and an autoscale group to start debian jessie (ami-b092aaad) on an hvm t2.medium in eu-central (Frankfurt) for approximately four weeks. Everything worked fine.

But suddenly the instance does not start any more. The machine is not reachable via network and the system log states ""reboot: machine restart
"" at its end.

A manual start of ami-b092aaad on a t2.medium in Frankfurt still works.

working:

Afterwards the manual working start does fire up ssh and is ready for use.
The autoscale not working start is stopping everything.

Is there subtile difference between manual and autoscale starts ? Or a change in amazons xen/hvm in frankfurt ?

Amazon EC2	"Re: EC2 Instance cannot work with 1/2 checks pass or Insufficient Data issue
Hey Collin,

The process you described of creating a snapshot of a root volume of an instance can be known to create issues if not all of the parameters are matched exactly to the previous instance. For example things like kernel ID and other things need to match, or this can cause the instances not to work correctly.

Instead of creating a snapshot, can you please instead create an AMI of your original instance (i-c5e0a837) using the below AMI guide:

http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/creating-an-ami-ebs.html

Creating an AMI directly from an instance is the preferred way to replicate an instance, as it will automatically incorporate all of those minor details (aki, virtualization, 32/64) for you and should result in an exact copy of your original instance.

Please try that above and let me know if the new instance still has those issues.

Troy W"

Amazon EC2	"backing a spot instance with on-demand for HA infrastracture
HI, 
I am considering moving a large part of my application to Spot in order to reduce my costs.
The spot instances are sitting behind a ELB and an auto-scaling group.

In order to achieve a HA infra. I want to back these instances with an on-demand instances.
Because aws doesn't allow configuring the ELB to distribute traffic in a weighted algo. , I'm currently considering the following options:

1. Distribute the traffic through Route53 weighted routing - giving the spot the majority of the traffic ( let's say a 19/1 ratio). I will accompany this with an health check.  This way if the spot is taken from me, the health check will fail and the on-demand will get 100% traffic.

2. writing a script that will monitor price of spot instance, and when price reaches threshold, to increase the minimum number of instances in on-demand scaling group to 1.

Is there another , more preferred way ?"

Amazon EC2	"Re: Launching an instance from an AMI results in an instance status check error
Hi there,

The most common cause for this is that your original instance probably has a Static IP configured on your networking interface within the operating system.

If you were to connect to your original instance and check its networking configuration please make sure that it is set to DHCP before creating the AMI otherwise your new instance that you launch off of the AMI will keep the same Static IP settings but the Elastic network Interface that the new instance has will most likely have a different IP address and so your instance is unable to communicate through this network interface.

Amazon EC2	"Re: SMTP rate limit not being lifted, despite submitting form
Hi there,

I had a look at your account and I can 100% confirm the rate limit has been removed.

You may however be reaching the limits of the networking performance on the instance type you are using as I noted that the instance with the Elastic IP 52.3.87.126 on your account would fall into the ""Low to Moderate Networking Performance"" level and so if you are pushing enough traffic this may be the bottleneck rather than the throttle.

Good Morning,

I think we have been hit with the infamous Windows 2012 R2 networking issue and I can't seem to get it resolved.  After a reboot due to Windows updates, one of our instances became unresponsive with the ""Waiting Metadata"" message in the logs over and over again.  (instance i-961de567)

I have tried the solution posted to create an image from the instance, then switching to a C3, but after that was done, I was still unable to RDP to the instance.  The system logs were completely blank when booting.  

After some more research, I saw that there was a Linux Recovery AMI, but when I launched that instance and SSH into it, I saw it was only for older versions. (e.g. Server 2008).

I also tried launching a new instance from the image created before changing to C3, but that presented the same issue.  (instance i-659f77ce)

Amazon EC2	"Re: Windows 2012 r2 Unreachable
Hi there,

I had a look at your instance and it is definitely NOT the Windows 2012 R2 problem

Seeing ""Waiting for Metadata"" combined with a failing health check is normally indicative of some kind of configuration problem of your network interface at the operating system level like the Network device being disabled or having Static IP settings different from the actual ENI values.

A quick way to test this is attach another secondary ENI to your instance and then try to RDP on that secondary ENI's IP address. This should give you access back to the instance and a chance to review the settings for the original network adapter. Just make sure that it is set to enabled and DHCP and that should have your instance passing health checks and accessible again. 

Alternatively you could also do this via offline registry edits on the root volume of your instance and in our documentation we have a step for step guide to do this.

I had a look at your instance's console output (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-console.html), and I can see the sshd service is failing to start: Starting sshd: Auto configuration failed

As your instance is ebs backed, you are able to stop your instance, detach its root volume, and attach it to another working instance in the same availability zone and view the logs to understand why the sshd service did not start.  Please create a snapshot of your volume before attempting to make any modifications: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-creating-snapshot.html

Another option is to create a snapshot of your root volume, and then create a volume from your snapshot and work on the newly created volume to fix/troubleshoot the issue.

IF you think recovering the data is an acceptable solution, you will be able to copy the data from your volume once you have it attached to your working instance.

Why not? This is a really elegant way to deploy:

1. When my Docker images are done building a postback is sent to my designated endpoint. (e.g. https://api.myapp.com/trigger-rolling-update).
2. My endpoint then uses the AWS SDK to send a request to aws asg triggerRollingUpdate [options]

This basic configuration on the ELB does not work. As I mentioned in my previous post, I added both instances to the ELB and the instance that only runs the service on port 8080 is described as 'Out of Service' in the ELB information since it is not running anything on port 80.

How can I get this to work?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: Load balancing multiple ports to different instances
That will not work with a single ELB by default, however you might still have a chance if you use iptables and redirect the port 80 traffic to 8080 on the instances listening on 8080."
Amazon EC2	"Re: Load balancing multiple ports to different instances
You mean configure IP tables on the instances running 8080 to direct traffic from 80 to 8080.

That doesn't work for me. Like I said these are two completely different services. The client knows that one service runs on 80 and the other on 8080. So I just want to redirect traffic coming on port 80 to the machine running the service on port 8080 and the client traffic coming from 80 to the machine running on port 80. 

This works as long as the services run on the same machine. But going forward we want to add multiple machines running this service and want to load balance the traffic coming on port 80 to say N machine have the service running on port 80 and the traffic coming on port 8080 to M machines running the service on port 8080.

It sounds like the ELB doesn't have any of this functionality and I'm better off just having a machine running Nginx or Apache customized for this.

Correct. All instances behind the ELB need to be capable of handling any request. Elastic Load Balancing (and Auto Scaling) can however help you build a robust Nginx/Apache setup. What looks like a single load balancer unit to you is actually a system that can scale up/down/in/out, and you can expect it to kind of repair itself when necessary. Having just a single EC2 instance could be seen as a step backwards in terms of reliability."
Amazon EC2	"Remote Access To RTSP Stream Hosted On EC2 Instance
I have an AWS EC2 instance running Windows Server 2012 R2 base. On this server I have an application running which starts a RTSP Stream of a video file. The application uses the Live555 library for this.

When running the application it automatically starts the stream on the EC2 instance's Private IP. That means that I can't access it from my PC at home.

So now I had the idea to set up a VPN to access the Private IP from my PC at home. So I installed Hamachi. From both ends (Server -> Remote PC, Remote PC -> Server) I can ping the other end and get a valid response.

However, when trying to access the RTSP stream in VLC using rtsp://xx.xxx.xx.xxx:8554/stream I can a connection error on the remote PC. I tried to replace the IP xx.xxx.xx.xxx with the public IP, the private IP and the Hamachi IP. None works.

The stream works when I try to open it locally on the server. I enter rtsp://xx.xxx.xx.xxx:8554/stream in the VLC player that I installed on the server and it perfectly streams the video file.

I updated the security of the instance already by allowing all outgoing and incoming traffic on all ports.

What am I missing?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: Remote Access To RTSP Stream Hosted On EC2 Instance
If the server application listens on the private IP address, you should be able to connect on the public IP address from the outside. The public address is mapped to the private address. As long as the application isn't using the loopback interface (127.0.0.1), you should be good. Listening on the private IP address is perfectly fine. Maybe you're getting blocked by the Windows firewall? Other than that, I'm not that familiar with RTSP, so not sure if the public/private IP 1:1 NAT could be causing trouble."
Amazon EC2	"aws ec2 attach-volume : Connection to ec2.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com timed out
I've been trying to mount an existing volume to a Amazon Linux EC2 instance - sounds simple I know!

The volume is currently in the ""available"" state according to the management console. And if I use the management console it will attach to the instance and I can use it. Great! Except that I'm trying to configure an AutoScalingGroup (with just 1 instance) which will automatically attach the volume to any new instance as it launches (via a UserData script)- the start of a basic failover procedure.

This is where the problem starts. I've connected to the EC2 instance via ssh and tried running the following command manually (I've tried both as root and +ec2-user+):
aws ec2 attach-volume --volume-id vol-8fed4a99 --instance-id i-b07d8c1c --device /dev/sdf


The result, after many attempts, is consistently this:
HTTPSConnectionPool(host='ec2.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: / (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<botocore.awsrequest.AWSHTTPSConnection object at 0x7f40c3c34310>, 'Connection to ec2.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com timed out. (connect timeout=60)'))


Here is what I have checked/confirmed so far:
1) Both the EC2 instance, and the EBS volume are in the eu-west-1a availability zone
2) The volume is ""available""
3) The EC2 instance lists no additional volumes in it's block devices (just the root device)
4) I've tried attaching it to different device slots (/dev/xvdb, /dev/xvdc, /dev/xvdd....etc)
5) The EC2 is running in a custom built subnet, but I've triple checked (NACLs, SecurityGroups, etc) and the instance can definitely connect to the outside world. I can download a linux .bin installer from https://www.atlassian.com/... without issue

Amazon EC2	"Re: How to automatically shutdown instance after some time?
We solved this via simple cron jobs which run nightly to shutdown our dev/qa instances which are not needed overnight.  We have a special tag set on all instances eligible for the nightly shutdown, and we put a filter condition into the aws cli command to only stop instances with that tag.  The cron job runs on one of our various utility servers which have 100% uptime.

It is a fairly simple solution, and has been working for us for several years.

Alternatively, you could put a cron job in each of the dev instances and make them each responsible for stopping them self."

It is possible that your inbound network acl is not allowing the full range of ephemeral ports for return http traffic, depending on the OS your instance is using.  Assuming you trust your inbound security group rules to properly filter inbound traffic (based on your screenshot they look perfect), you can try allowing all inbound on your network acl to see if that fixes it.  If so, you can then start tightening up your network acl again.

Amazon EC2	"Unable to extend a volume to a bigger size than 2TB
Hi, 
We have an EC2 instance i2.xlarge and it has currently few volumes all under 1TB. I would like to change one of the volumes to be a bigger size (3.4TB). The volumes have been previously partitioned using mbr style, and they contain data. 
What I did was:

Took snapshot of the volume 
Created a new volume (3.4TB) using the snapshot
Attached the volume to the instance
From disk manager (tried also diskpart), tried to bring the disk online and extend it to get the full size 3.4 TB

The problem is that; when I check the newly added disk in the disk manager, it contains 1TB of original volume, and 2 separated unallocated sections (1 TB and 1.4TB). I was able to extend the volume to be 2TB, but when trying to extend it to get the remaining 1.4 TB also in use, it complains: 
Virtual Disk Service error:
Only the first 2TB are usable on large MBR disks.
Cannot create partitions beyond the 2TB mark, nor convert
the disk to dynamic.
I tried to convert the first 1TB section of volume to gpt style, however that is not allowed: 
Virtual Disk Service error:
The specified disk is not convertible. CDROMs and DVDs
are examples of disks that are not convertable.

So I ended up with creating a new empty volume with size 3.4 TB, attached to the instance and partitioned as gpt, then manually copy the data from the original 1TB volume to the newly added one! 

Is there anything I could do to avoid this slow and inefficient way of handling volume re-size?

Amazon EC2	"Re: Unable to extend a volume to a bigger size than 2TB
Hello,

Unfortunately that is a limitation of the MBR partition scheme and as such it doesn't have anything to do with EBS. EBS is by definition a block storage. The service is not aware of the structure or semantics of the data you write or read from each block.

The partition table on MBR disks has a fixed size to allocate the addresses of each partition boundary and the maximum addressable size is 2 TiB. It is recommended that you use GPT partition tables if you plan to use volumes larger than 2 TiB.

Hi,

Thanks. Indeed, the SSH problem was partly because of the IP. I don't know how I forgot to check that, maybe because there was also the port 80 problem now. Earlier I had changed the IP for SSH rule but not this time.

Setting the IP in the SSH rule was not enough though. Still logging to the machine with SSH is not possible. I get this:

Also the port 80/web server doesn't answer, and I believe at least the nginx should be up and running on that machine. So something is still broken. 

This ""ssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host"" doesn't seem to appear anymore after trying a few times. SSH just hangs with the line ""debug1: Local version string SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_6.6.1p1 Ubuntu-2ubuntu2"".

I had seen this same SSH problem before a few times and after rebooting it worked fine. This problem seems to persists, so I think it would be worth fixing it, so I would not want to resort to rebooting, especially because the port 80 doesn't answer either.

There was a problem with the underlying hardware that caused the underlying system to crash.

Hi, I'm interested in building a website in AWS that includes a single page with a form that users can fill out and pay by credit card. The form needs to email us when someone submits it. We're probably going to use Drupal for the interface and Commerce module for payment processing...a bit overkill but we're used to it and it shouldn't be too complicated.

My questions for you guys is this: what AWS services do I need to enable to do the following:
1. SSL for secure payment processing?
2. Ability for users to submit forms that get emailed to us?

Thanks!"
Amazon EC2	"Re: What do I need to Enable for SSL and Email
It sounds like you have ended up in the right forum. EC2 is a very relevant service in this case. You probably know that it provides you with a virtual server where you can install pretty much anything you need. Regarding your specific questions: For SSL, you need to obtain your certificate from another party at this time. The Simple Email Service could be of interest when it comes to sending the form information. If you need email accounts as well, take a look at WorkMail."

Amazon EC2	"Re: error uploading SSL Certificate
Hello,

Thank you for the post.

The certificate chain enables a browser to build a certificate chain to a root certificate that it trusts. As a result, the browser can implicitly trust your certificate. Therefore, you are receiving ""This connection is Untrusted"" error while browsing from certain web browsers like Firefox.

Furthermore, certificate chain includes the intermediate certificates and optionally the root certificate, one after the other without any blank lines, as shown in the following example:
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
Intermediate certificate 2
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
Intermediate certificate 1
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
Optional: Root certificate
-----END CERTIFICATE-----

More information about ""SSL Certificates for Elastic Load Balancing"" can be found on this documentation: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/ssl-server-cert.html

In order to get the correct intermediate certificate and/or the root certificate for certificate chain, please work with your Certificate Authority i.e., Comodo.

I hope the above information helps.

Amazon EC2	"Minecraft Server Lags, Even After Upgrade
Hello - 

I am an AWS user who heard about the free plan where you get an t2.micro EC2 instance free for a year. I also read a post about running a Minecraft server on an EC2 server, so I gave it a try. The server worked fine, and I had up to 5 people on the server at once. But then one day (I pinpointed it to August 19th) the server CPU spiked to 100%, and everyone started to experience lots of server lag thereafter, with almost 1-2 second delays between commands. I heard in the post that t2.micro instances sometimes had crazy CPU throttling, which could cause problems, so today I tried copying all the server files to a brand new t2.small instance. At first, no lag, then after a few minutes, the usual server lag came back. Why is this happening? Is this just a general problem with EC2, because I have heard of other servers that flourished with a t2.MICRO instance with LESS server lag than a gaming host. Anyone know any solutions? Thanks in advance!"

Once you have confirmed your custom metric is providing data via an API call, it is necessary to update which metrics are displayed on the Cloudwatch tab of the AWS Management console.

Amazon EC2	"Network issues
We have a (recurring) network problem - instances become unreachable via network, and unable to reach outside world from withing the computer, yet EC2 internal status checks stay OK (2/2 successful).

For example, last time this happened to 2 instances: i-ff9f32af and i-71daab8c on Aug 20 (7 days ago).
This is not the first time we've had this kind problem, but it's the first time that two servers were affected at once.
Rebooting the instance helps, but we do not consider rebooting instances as a viable production solution.

There are two problems with this:
1. The fact the servers are unreachable from network (and can't reach network themselves either)
2. Since the health-checks pass, no alarms fire - so we don't even know the service is affected unless we attempt to use it ourselves or use additional (external) monitoring.

If you allocate your own Elastic IP and associate it to an interface or instance, it should stick across reboots. (Or can always be re-associated.) If not and it was released, you're basically out of luck. In either case, I'd recommend that you at least set up a DNS record within your own domain that your app uses and that points to your elastic IP's public hostname. This will give you the flexibility to point it elsewhere when needed like a Elastic Load Balancer. (You'll probably want to use a low TTL.). If you use Route53, you can alias it directly to an instance or ELB."

Amazon EC2	"EC2 Server Load
I am creating an iOS app that connects to an EC2 server which hosts php pages that connect to an RDS MySQL instance. I also use an S3 bucket to host pictures for this app. I am using my free year of AWS so I only have access to the free-tier services (i.e. a t2.micro EC2 instance).

This app is for an event that will last about 6 hours on one day. I anticipate probably about several hundred or maybe more people will be using the app frequently during that time period. The app connects to the EC2 server when it is first opened, and then about once every hour after that. My question is whether this t2.micro EC2 instance that I am using will be able to withstand this load or will something bad happen. I ask this because I set up a CloudWatch for the server and I get a warning for CPUUtilization >= 70% for 5min
 about once a day, and right now I'm the only person ever connecting to the server.

Amazon EC2	"Re: EC2 Server Load
Hello,
thank you for your message. Even if you're planning to use your instance for just one event that will last about 6 hours, I'd recommend you to perform further tests on it and eventually consider a larger instance type (as m3.mediun or m3.large), because T2 instance types have a CPU credit monitoring [1]: if vCPU is used at 100% for 1 minute, your Credits will be decreased and new credits will be earned when performances are below its base performance level allows (such as when it is idle).

Amazon EC2	"Re: EC2 Server Load
Thank you for your response.

I think I can probably expect to have a consistent amount of 0 credits, which means the instance will be running at its base performance level, which is 10% of CPU. How many connections per hour is a t2.micro at 10% of CPU able to sustain? We are just talking about a connection to a simple php page that accesses a MySQL database, which I don't think takes a lot of CPU power. 

What happens if there are too many connections to the instance? Will that just mean there will be more of a wait to connect to it? How much of a wait?"

Amazon EC2	"Doubts about AutoScaling with several policies
Hi,

I have some doubts regarding AutoScaling:

Let's say I'm setting up AutoScaling with the following metrics: CPU, Memory. Each of them has a scale up / down policy:

CPU: 
  - Scale up by adding 1 instance if CPU has been above 80% for the last 10 minutes.
  - Scale down by removing 1 instance if CPU has been under 20% for the last 10 minutes.

Memory:
   same than above (CPU).

so far everything seems to be working okay, but now I'm thinking in adding a third scale policy in order to scale if my instances are attacked with DDoS, hence I'll use NetworkIn as a metric to scale.

Considering this scenario: 

If I add this policy based on NetworkIn metric, and let's say that in some moment the scaling policy gets triggered and launch 2 instances because I'm receiving a lot of inbound traffic, if after 10 minutes I am still receiving high amount of traffic but on those instances CPU and RAM are under 20% will my other scale down policies trigger and remove these instances even if I'm still receiving high traffic?

Thank you for the post.

I took a look at your instances: i-2e1312fd and i-e30e0f30, and I see that everything i.e., security groups, network ACLs and route table, is configured correctly. Also, I tried to connect to the instances using netcat command on port 22 (SSH) and I was able to connect. Please see the output below:

From the above output, it looks like the instance is accepting connections on port 22 (SSH).

The error you are receiving: Permission denied (publickey) could be because, you are connecting with inappropriate user name for your AMI and that you have not specified the proper private key (.pem) file for your instance.

Hi Stooby,

First of all thanks for giving some feedback.I knew that if I'm expecting an increment in the amount of traffic I'll be receiving anytime I could request a ""pre-warmed"" ELB just as you say, the problem is that there are sometimes when you get this kind of traffic in a ""unpredictable"" way, for example when you're being attacked with a DDoS.

According to the article you cited above, ELB will start to throw 503 errors when its capacity is near its limits, but of course, in terms of availability this could be translated as legit users will get this error and not the actual site because the DDoS attacker is taking all the current ELB resources.

Do you have problems with a small number of users who can't load web pages, download files, or otherwise interact with your EC2 server?

The problem might be the Default security policy.  It does not allow ICMP Type 3, Code 4 packets through.  This means that Path MTU discovery is broken.

You have three options:

#1. Allow all ICMP through (-1, -1, 0.0.0.0/0).
#2.  Stop sending packets out with Dont Fragment set:
   echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_no_pmtu_disc
#3.  Enable Linux path MTU Black hole detection:
   echo 1 >  /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_mtu_probing
 or echo 1 for detect, then use, echo 2 for always use it.

These solutions only solve the problem for data going out of your system to the other end.  If the other end has the problem in reverse, data from them to you, you can't fix it*.  They have to fix it.

AWS itself is bugged by this problem; it is impossible to login when there is a reduced-MTU link(VPN, 6to4, 4to6, etc) in your path because the AWS login screen uses images served by Akamai, which has the same defective firewall in front of their CDN servers.  Ticket was opened with Akamai (for www.apple.com, also won't load), AKAM-CASE #B-C-32AU2F.  Their initial finding was 'no problem found' so they will need additional input.  Akamai would appear to be the #1 biggest cause of Path MTU brokenness in the whole darn Internet.  AWS would have to be #2.

Amazon EC2	"Re: Default Security Policy breaks Path MTU discovery; web pages won't load.
I know this is an old post - but for anyone else struggling with this, Clarence has hit the nail on the head.

I battled with this problem for weeks before discovering it was an issue with MTU - and in my experience, it affected a huge variety of home routers - such as the Belkin F5D7633 (ADSL2+ Wireless G router) and SMC Barricade, Zyxel etc.....

This issue was single-handedly responsible for eroding the confidence of many of my clients to host stable and reliable sites (particularly those that used SSL) - and was only fixed by firmware upgrades to the clients' routers.

The most obvious symptoms were repeated entries claiming SYN Flood to Host in the routers logs.
For anyone else struggling with this issue - follow Clarence's advice above and check for firmware updates.

Once I did that - the problem was solved."

Hi Clarence 
Im experiencing the same problem and I came across your post. I have added 'All ICMP' for all of my inbound traffic, all the ports as well, but still Im experiencing the same problem? What am I doing wrong here?

I am about two days into attempting to install FFMPEG-php with dependencies on an AWS EC2 instance running the Amazon Linux AMI. I've installed FFMPEG, and have read reportedly successful instructions on installing on Red Hat/Fedora. I have followed a number of tutorials and forum articles to do so, but have had no luck yet. As far as I can tell, the main problems are as followed:

I have installed all the dependency for ffmpeg-php. I run the following command successfully.

$wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/ffmpeg-php/ffmpeg-php/0.6.0/ffmpeg-php-0.6.0.tbz2 $tar xvfj ffmpeg-php-0.6.0.tbz2 $phpize

But when I run the following command it throw the error like below:

$sudo ./configure

configure: error: ffmpeg shared libraries not found. Make sure ffmpeg is compiled as shared libraries using the --enable-shared option}

I have used enable shared option with shared enable option but it throw the same error.

On to my question: Has anyone successfully installed FFMPEG-php on Amazon Linux? Is there a fundamental incompatibility? If anyone could share specific instructions on installing ffmpeg-php on amazon linux I would be greatly appreciative. Any other insights/experiences would also be appreciated."
Amazon EC2	"Re: Need to install or compile ffmpeg-php into EC2 instance
You should be able to point to the ffmpeg install directory to help the configure script find the libraries. To get the ffmpeg path, look for the --prefix option in the output of ffmpeg --help

Then you can pass this to the configure script:
./configure --with-ffmpeg=<prefix path>

Depending on how you built and installed ffmpeg, you may need to adjust the path above to point at the shared libraries.
I hope this helps,

Amazon EC2	"Re: Bug in ami-12195765; 100% CPU, Windows Update never completes.
Hi sircompo,

Could you provide the instance where you experienced this issue? Also, did event viewer throw any errors during the windows update process?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: Bug in ami-12195765; 100% CPU, Windows Update never completes.
Hi Rodney,

i-624fd1c3 is one of the machines, but it should be possible for you to replicate the issue by launching a new instance based on the previously mentioned ami.

One thing I've just noticed (from looking at CloudWatch stats), is that the CPU immediately dropped to idle when I gave up and went home last night (I left the session open in an RDP window, but my workstation was locked). When I checked this morning, Win Update had completed the detection phase and was offering me updates. Clicking 'Install' max'd out the CPU again and a 'Cancelled' error and an option to Try Again. I clicked 'Try Again' and the CPU has max'd out and it says 'downloading updates...' but is stuck at 0% and there's no i/o. 
Perhaps the lull in CPU activity was a fluke as I've not been able to replicate it this morning. 
NB. This was on a different instance; i-464b2de7.

The only way I can get the system to respond to open eventvwr is to set the svchost priority to Low or to stop the wuauserv service. There are no event log warnings or errors.

Interestingly, I see that windowsupdate.log shows shows errors from before the instance was launched (i.e. from when the image was originally commissioned by Amazon) -

Amazon EC2	"ec2-consistent-snapshot and NFS lockups?

Beyond that the server is completely unresponsive for any NFS mounts, web servers monitoring pages start to fail and the file server needs to be stopped and started to recover use of NFS services again from the webs.

Often times, just prior to this lockup I have a snapshot that is started using ec2-consistent-snapshot running like the following:

Have others noticed this same issue or have any helpful advice?

Amazon EC2	"Re: (Bug report) IAM ""power user"" cannot upload ELB SSL certificate
Hi Joe,
I'm just learning IAM policies. So, if I read your response correctly, this is 0 or 1; the permission is either ALL IAM permissions or NONE, there's no greater granularity, like allowing the upload of certs, only, not the deletion? 
If I've gotten this wrong, do you have the URL for the documentation? I've searched but think I may not be familiar enough with AWS to be searching efficiently.

fedkad wrote:
1. One continuously running EBS instance (Ubuntu Linux): t2.micro looks fine, but the 8 GB disk volume size may be limiting in the future.

A t2.micro Linux in US East (N. Virginia) is $14.64 per month. General Purpose (recommended!) EBS storage is $0.10 per GB and month, so $0.80 for 8 GB as disk is charged separately. You can always expand the size of an existing volume or add additional ones.

2. One Elastic IP to bind my domain name.

Free as long as the instance is up and running.

3. One VPC. By default 3 subnets are given, but one will be more than enough. Also 1 Network ACL and 1 Security Group looks enough.

There is no additional charge for this VPC configuration. The VPC service is free, apart from VPN functionality that you don't need in this case.

4. One registered .com domain name under ""Route 53"".

Currently $12 per year.

5. Also a secondary DNS server may be needed. The primary DNS server will be my instance itself. (<100K DNS queries per month.)

Unless you really want to run your own DNS server, I can recommend Route 53. Fast, stable, good integration with different AWS services. You get four name server addresses that are routed to nearby locations depending on where the user is located. Route 53 is all over the world. DNS service is $0.50 per month for one domain, plus $0.40 per million standard queries (that is, ordinary DNS records, latency/geo and more advanced are extra). While you can use Route 53 as secondary only, I would recommend that you use it for all your DNS needs. Less manual configuration and updates.

My expected Internet traffic is < 10GB/month (both directions).

Inbound is always free. 10 GB outbound in US East (N. Virginia) is $0.81.

Resizing the instance type and expanding the Storage Space of an EBS Volume are two separate events. When you resize the instance type, it doesn't affect the EBS volume size, it only changes the size of your instance in terms of compute, memory, network performance, etc.

7. Check in the disk management utility (diskmgmt.msc) that your secondary volume is getting detected.

Amazon EC2	"network connection issues in Amazon network
Hi all,

For some days we see that from time to time there're connection issues within Amazon network and during this time the servers are very slow to respond, even they are not loaded

The IP of one of the hosts is as follows: 216.182.236.113, it is part of Amazon network.

Amazon EC2	"Can't connect to new Ubuntu instance
(EDIT*** This is a repost because the AWS rep that first chimed in sort of faded away and I don't want my question to get lost in the background.)

I just created an Ubuntu instance, but keep getting timeout errors when trying to ssh in using Putty.

I've followed all the instructions, and I've researched the forums for similar cases and tried the fixes noted in those threads, to wit, I've adjusted the security group rules to allow access on port 22, to allow pinging using ICMP, etc, etc.

I've also made sure port 22 is open on the requesting computer, and I've attempted connecting from work, from home using FIOS, and from an uncontrolled access point (basically, my point here is I feel confident I've ruled out things like firewalls or corporate domains getting in the way).

Hi Robert,

Generally with the ubuntu instances, you need to try and use the following usernames to log in via ssh. It depends on which ubuntu AMI you are using.

root

If you can let me know the AMI ID, I can figure out which username to use in putty to connect to the instance.

Amazon EC2	"Re: Cannot connection to EC2 with custom ssh port
Hi okihouse16,

In the AWS EC2 console, if you select the instance and check the bottom pane and see the ""Status Checks"" tab, you will find that there are 2 health checks.
1. System Status Checks
2. Instance Status Checks

Please refer to the attached screenshot.

The System Status Checks is for the underlying host/hardware. We can check the root cause if it is the System Status Check failure.

The Instance Status Checks is for the Instance/Operating System itself. You can check the system logs and figure out if the instance is failing to boot. To check the OS console logs, you can right click on the instance and select ""Instance Settings"" -> ""Get System Log"". It will provide you some additional information.

Since your instance i-dc07b82e is already in terminated state, we could not verify whether it was a System Status Checks failure or the Instance Status Checks failure.

I hope this help if you encounter this type of issue in future.

I am running a EC2 instance (ID:i-0007bd38) in China region, I cann't access its 80,443,8080 port by public IP .  I already open these ports in security group , and clean iptables with iptables -F .

Amazon EC2	"Re: ec2 80,443,8080 port blocked?
Have you started a web server? Are the ports open on the machine when you check them locally?

Open a command window/shell and type the command:

netstat -an

Check the list looking for a line that has a LISTENING state and the local address has a suffix reading :80 or :443 or :8080.

If you can't find the lines, then the machine isn't waiting to receive network traffic on those ports.

If they are listed, then the machine is waiting for the network traffic, but you need to check the ip address shown in the local address column. This needs to be either one of the interface addresses (as seen when you execute 'ifconfig -a' on linux, or 'ipconfig/all' on windows) or the general ip address :::80 for ip6, 0.0.0.0:80 or *:80 for ip4.

If this all appears right, then its likely to be firewall permissions that are getting you."

Ok... really newbie here and I'm having problems setting up really simple stuff. Here's the deal...


I set up 1 EC2 instance (redhat) installed httpd on it and everything went smoothly.
I set up 1 RDS instance (mysql) 
Created security group for both so I can ssh from the outside and the two instances to communicate on  port 3306, mysql.
installed php-mysql, php-pdo, mysql (client)

So far so good.

Now the issue:
I can connect without any problem from the EC2 instance using the mysql client (from the ssh/console) by running ""mysql -h RDS-ENDPOINT -u user -p"". However when I try to connect to the RDS from a php file, either a test php just to test the connection, or run Wordpress site on the ec2 web server I'm unable to connect.

So, what I've checked so far:

both instances are in the same VPC
ec2 instance can access the rds instance and connect to mysql (via mysql client)
checked my php db configuration 10 times
mysql (and mysqli, and pdo) php extension are loaded fine
security group is fine since I can connect via ssh (as supposed) and can mysql connect to RDS from th EC2 BUT only from mysql cli client.

Hello

Thanks for your help.

The instance id is i-483e2a60"
Amazon EC2	"Re: EC2 Instance Status Checks fail
Hi there,

From our investigation, it appears that this is due to an incorrectly configured network interface, which is causing issues with your connections to your instance.

What we recommend is that you go ahead and attach an additional ENI to this instance.
You should then attempt to connect on this secondary ENI. This should give you RDP access which you can then use to amend the configuration of your original network Adapter.
You will need to make sure that it is enabled and also set to use DHCP. 

Once this is done the Health checks should pass and the instance be contactable on the eth0 IP addresses and so the secondary ENI can be detached.

If this however doesn't work or if you realize tha connectivity  is being lost often it may be that the system time has been changed and DHCP leases appear expired to the operating system and so then you could attempt these steps:
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/troubleshooting-windows-instances.html#instance-loses-network-connectivity

I hope this helps.
Let me know if you're still having problems"

Amazon EC2	"Unexpected reboots of instance
Hi,

We have an Ubuntu 14.04 instance (i-fd3edfbd) that has been installed and running fine for a long time but has rebooted twice on its own recently. Both times it was at exactly 22.11 (GMT) on August 17th and August 20th.

I dont see why the OS would suddenly start to do this, but is there a way I can check the logs of the underlying hardware or hypervisor to see if that is causing the issue? Nothing is logged in the server logs and its like the instance is 'hard' reset (ie not cleanly shut down and rebooted) which is obviously a concern!

Any ideas?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: Unexpected reboots of instance
Hello, 

This is to confirm you that your instance was rebooted due to underlying host issue. This has nothing to do your OS/Application.

In future you can look at CloudWatch Metrics to determine if it is possible issue with underlying hardware or instance itself by looking at Status Check Failed (System)  or Status Check Failed (Instance) (Count). Usually if you see Status Check Failed (System), indicates and underlying hardware issue. Please see the links below for more information:

http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/viewing_metrics_with_cloudwatch.html

http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-system-instance-status-check.html

You can also create an Alarm to monitor these events. Please see the link below:

https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/ec2-instance-status-metrics/

To resolve this issue please stop the instance and start again so that it will start on a new hardware. Sorry for the inconvenience, I have reported this issue to my internal team.

Note: Any data store on the instance store (Temp store) will be deleted when you stop and start instance. Please see link below:

Amazon EC2	"Re: Unable to connect to: i-07d647c2
Hello,

I am sorry to hear about the issues. 

I have reviewed your instance Id: i-b06ef775, CloudWatch metrics and can see CPU was really hot, consistently above 80%. Although you are using one of most powerful instance type but I have no visibility in what application or programs you are running inside the instance.

I further looked into the your EBS performance and found that Average Queue Length was as high as 25. It seems you may be running resource intensive application inside the instance like DB. You could also review these CloudWatch metrics, please see the link below for more information:

http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/viewing_metrics_with_cloudwatch.html

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-volume-status.html

You are using Provisioned IOPS on EBS volume but the IOPS assigned to EBS volume is too low based on demand. To resolve this issue I would suggest to take a snapshot of existing EBS and create EBS volume with higher provisioned IOPs (State with 30 X size of volume in GB). This should improve performance and allow you to login into the instance.

Once you are logged in to the instance check what process are taking most of resources. Remove unwanted programs, if you are running antivirus make sure to exclude larges files like database from on access scan, run disk cleanup, disk defragment etc. It should not be much different than performance tuning any other virtual or physical windows machine.

Each application requirement is different than other application, like some are CPU, Disk, Memory etc. The advantage of using EC2 is that it allows you to change resources without losing any data and with few clicks.

I trust you will find above useful. Please let us know how it goes.

I have to admit, I am discouraged that not only have I yet to get a response to this, but in searching the forums I have found another with my EXACT same problem and the same EXACT slow crawl decline issue from months ago that was never actually addressed at all by Amazon.

I have to admit, when I spent several hundred dollars on a reserve instance, I did not realize it came with such an apathetic level of support.  If you have a problem, you can not call anyone, you can not open a support ticket (unless you want to shell out an extra $60/month), all you can apparently do is post here in the forums and pray that some Amazon tech will decide to help.

I would hate to think that I could have my whole server fail and go down and it may be days or never that someone would followup.

Amazon, if I am misunderstanding things or have perhaps been misinformed here, please let me know.  I like EC2, have used it for some time on the free tier with no issue, but now that I bought in I have concerns.  Please tell me I am wrong in the above."
Amazon EC2	"Re: CPU Credit Issue
Guess I will respond to myself since Amazon is not.  I decided to do a complete power off of the instance and start back up to see if that would reset the CPU Credits and possibly resolve the problem.  It did cause the CPU Credits to start back over at 30, and they then climbed at a normal rate as one would expect them to do.  Unfortunately once we reached this 166-167 range again, the credits took a turn back down and again started their slow death crawl despite there being no change in CPU usage on the system.  This is all backed up by the graphs on the instance.  

To me this is clearly an issue on the Amazon EC2 end.  My server is in no way aware of it's CPU Credit limit and would not in some strange way decide to react based on that count.  Even if it did, it would have to reflect in the CPU Usage and that is not occurring, only the CPU Credits are affected.

Amazon, I understand now that I purchased a $300 instance that comes with zero guarantees, technical support, or service commitments, but could you perhaps take pity on me this one time and at least make sure you are delivering what I paid for?

I currently have a problem with one of my instances stuck in the shutting-down state for nearly a day now. The instance ID is i-b8367d73. 
The instance was running, so I stopped it previously. This action already hung, the instance still was stopping two days later. I selected to ""forcefully stop"" it, but with no effect. And now the termination also dosn't work.

You can use our Report Abuse page (https://aws.amazon.com/forms/report-abuse) to submit any relevant information about a potential abusive behavior by AWS users. Our abuse team will review your claims and act accordingly.

I would recommend that if the unwanted traffic is originating in one of your instances, you consider trying to find what the process is and stop it. If your instance is running in a VPC you can also prevent that outbound traffic from leaving your instance by using Egress rules in the Security Groups attached to the instances.

Amazon EC2	"Re: How to apply instance to reserved instance
I don't think this is partial payment of upfront. My billing detail as below:

USD 0.074 hourly fee per Windows (Amazon VPC), m1.medium instance: 711.188 Hrs	$52.63

Amazon EC2	"Re: How to apply instance to reserved instance
I think $327 is partial upfront for m1.medium/Windows. Partial upfront payments also have hourly discounted rate - which amazon charges upfront for the month.

So whether you are using the reserved instance or not, Amazon will bill you monthly for hourly usage for that reserved instance. (They bill you for 24*30(or 31) hours upfront, and matching instance use that billed hours...)"

Hello,

It sounds like you purchased a Partial Upfront Reserved Instance. If that's the case, you pay a portion of the cost upfront and the remaining hours in the term (either one year or three years) are billed at a discounted hourly rate, regardless of usage.

Funny story, so, this instance was a stop/start of an existing, unresponsive instance.

If you stop/start an instance, you may not get that message. What really got me, was I was trying to access the started server using the Elastic IP, but it was unreachable because they are released on stop!

Amazon EC2	"Re: i-5a6e1835 - Stuck - Ec2Config Service is rebooting the instance.
Glad to hear the issue is resolved!

Just wanted to chime in with one tip: Your instance is running in the EC2-Classic platform, and yes when EC2-Classic instances are stopped their Elastic IP is disassociated.
However that behavior changed in the EC2-VPC platform! You can stop and start back again a VPC EC2 instance and if it has en Elastic IP attached to it it will remain attached throughout the entire process.

Thanks, this is what I am doing currently. However, it requires a restart and does not jive well with using SSM to join my Directory Services. I would think relaunching a server at an IP would be a somewhat common occurrence so that there is a way to do this using SSM."
Amazon EC2	"Re: Setting computer name to instance id on Windows
Hi, kwilson_premise ,

You can rename a computer using userdata and use SSM to domain join using the new name in single reboot. 

You can then use the powershell command to rename the computer with force flag and without the restart flag. 
(https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Hh849792.aspx)
Rename-Computer -NewName <String> -Force 

This will leave the computer in pending reboot phase, and then SSM will perform the domain join using the new name and reboot the machine to complete the domain join with the new name. 

let us know if you face any issues.

We will see if we can add a configurable option so that Ec2config can handle this scenario to rename the computer to instance-id."
Amazon EC2	"Windows 2008 and EC2Config
Hi,

I'm currently trying to get a Windows 2008 Server (ami-5fe81d34) instance created using a user data powershell script and AWS Console.  I tried both string and file values and I was able to confirm that the UserData.ps1 [1] file has the correct contents.  Sadly, this is where my problems start:


When I use a user data file, the last entry in the system log is ""Message: Windows is Ready to use"" and there are not log files in the log directory [2].  The script does not get executed.
When I use a user data string (base 64 or not), usually the behavior is the same as the user data file approach, but sometimes I think the UserData.ps1 file does get executed, because I'll see a message in the system log and log directory [2] with an error message like ""EC2Config configuration: status:3;..."".  I tried to create a new IAM policy [3] to allow for SSM, but since the UserData.ps1 script execution is inconsistent, I wanted to reach out to the community and figure that out first.


I was able to verify that the version of EC2ConfigService on the AMI is 3.6.269.0.  I see on the EC2ConfigService developer tool page [4] that there is a newer version available (3.7.308).  Is there a new Windows 2008 Server AMI available with the new service or is the current practice that one would take the latest AMI, update the EC2ConfigService, and manually publish a new base (one-time) before hooking in any automation?

Advice on how I should best approach this?

Hi.

I was using a server a month or so ago and it was all working fine. I suspended my account and got it reactivated... but now the servers are not working fine. I've tried a couple of different (new) instances, all share the same problem. They seem to lose all networking anything from a few minutes to 15m after being started up.

Edited by: Matt C on Jul 31, 2015 3:56 AM"
Amazon EC2	"Re: EC2 Instance Falls Off The Net
Hello Matt,

The first thing you need to do is to lock down your security groups. Currently for the instance you mentioned in your post, the Security Groups are wide open and allows RDP and ICMP connection from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0). This can result in being subjected to a DDOS via RDP.

We have seen this in the past where a DDOS via constant RDP connection brings the instance to its kneels.  I would recommend that you lock down access to the RDP and ICMP to your Public IP only and restart the server as currently it is not responding to RDP. Once you have logged in to the server, check the Windows Event logs and verify if you see multiple failed RDP logon events.

If you still continue to face the issue even after locking down the ports, please let us know.

Regarding changing the region of an instance, you cannot change the region once the instance is launched. You could however, create an AMI of the instance and then copy the AMI to the intended region and deploy an instance out of that AMI. Please note that copying the AMI across regions incurs transfer charges.

I hope I have addressed your question.

Let us know if you have any further questions or need clarifications if any.

Hi,

You could have just been unlucky and experiences problems with 2 faulty pieces of hardware.  Check which Status Check failed to determine if its likely to be the underlying host or potentially a software/network config error.  

From within the AWS Console, select the instance and then select 'Status Checks'.  If there is a problem with the 'System' status check then its likely an underlying host hardware issue.  If its an 'Instance' Status check fault then its more likely to be an issue with the software/config of the instance itself which you will need to investigate further.

Hello,
thank you for contacting us.

Reviewing your i-d6305f7e instance details, it seems that it was running on a faulty hardware on both 28/07 and 30/07, this explains why both System and Instance reachability checks failed. [1]

System status checks monitor the AWS systems required to use your instance to ensure they are working properly. These checks detect problems with your instance that require AWS involvement to repair. The following are examples of problems that can cause system status checks to fail:
 * Loss of network connectivity
 * Loss of system power
 * Software issues on the physical host
 * Hardware issues on the physical host 

[1] http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-system-instance-status-check.html

Amazon EC2	"Alternative to using elastic IPs for dev boxes
I have a few ec2 boxes that I use as dev servers.  I spin them up at the beginning of business hours, and down at the end of the day.  2 TLDs and many subdomains are being pointed at them to handle ports: 80, 443, 22, 21.  This can all be handled via elastic IPs (what I am doing currently) and does it well.  The problem is the fact that I only get 5 elastic IPs.  I would love to have a solution that gives me space for more than 5 boxes.  I began playing around with using a load-balancer on each TLD.  The problem is the fact that the load balancer config does not allow port 22 and 21 to be handled, plus it seems like the wrong use for a load balancer.

Anyone else out there have any thoughts for a solution to this, or the AWS intended way to handle it?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: Alternative to using elastic IPs for dev boxes
You can always apply for an increased Elastic IP limit in the Support Center section of the Management Console. In the upper right hand corner, click Support, then Support Center. From there, you can create a Service Limit Increase case. If you're in VPC, you will want to select just that as the Limit Type (instead of the Elastic IP option that appears). Selecting VPC allows you to choose Elastic IP in a later field."

Amazon EC2	"How to verify if an instance is running as on-demand or reserved?
Hi there,
after the annoucement of the new ""No Upfront payment"" reserved instances, I quickly reserved 4 instances for all my currently running instances.
Now, what is very far from being clear even after checking the forum, is how I can verify if the new price scheme applies to my running instances or if I need to take some special action to bind my instances to the 4 reserved instances like starting and stopping the instances, create new AMIs and restart them or whatever. 
My current understanding is that AWS does it automagically by matching the instance size and OS type, but it's not clear if the ""active"" status in the reserved instances panel means that the instance is actually running or if it is ready to be associated with an instance.
Inspecting the information about a running instance in the AWS instances console doesn't help either as I can't spot anything telling me if the instance is now running as a reserved instance or not.

Could you please provide me with a method for checking the current status of an instance in terms of its type?

Thank you

Thank you
Flavio"
Amazon EC2	"Re: How to verify if an instance is running as on-demand or reserved?
Hello, 

When you buy Reserved Instances you're buying a capacity reservation and billing discount. As you correctly said, AWS does the matching for you, provided your reservation matches the specifications of the instance (platform, instance type, Availability Zone, and tenancy) you want to receive the discount on. The ""active"" status means that the purchase has been processed successfully. 

Instances aren't bound to reservations, and it is possible to modify your reserved instances: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ri-modifying.html. 

You can also generate reports with details about your Reserved Instance utilization. This tutorial covers how to get started with usage reports: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/usage-reports.html.

I am currently running a couple of EC2 exim mail relays. Earlier this month it was brought to my attention that our EC2 IPs had been reported to Trend and listed in the DUL. To restore mail flow the relays were redirected to a privately hosted smart host and Trend were contacted in relation.

A requested was processed on the 12/06/15 with use case details and a full explanation. Since this time I have heard nothing back in relation, and both IPs remain listed with Trend.

Amazon EC2	"Re: EC2 SMTP restriction removal request not processed
As I've heard nothing back in relation from AWS support I have investigated this issue further through Trend. 

Trend apparently lists all dynamic IPs in their DUL. This causes all/most EIPs being listed as they are assigned from a dynamic block. The correct process to resolve this issue is to request reverse DNS entries for the IPs in question, and then request AWS contact Trend to have the IPs delisted. 

This is why the link provided by Trend was for the outbound EC2 SMTP restriction removal as the rDNS requests are part of this form. 

I have submitted this form twice now - once before posting this thread, and once again a number of weeks ago. I have had literally no response to either of these requests, and no further assistance from AWS support here on the forums. 

I must admit, while I have had positive experiences in the past, I have been extremely disappointed with AWS' customer service in relation to this matter.

Amazon EC2	"Re: EC2 unresponsive for 6 times today
Hello,

I had looked at the health of all three instances and cannot see any performance issue in terms of CPU and network.

I have noticed frequent health check failures of your backend instances. When ELB does not receive successful response to your health checks it marks them Out of service. Please refer to link below to troubleshoot health check failures:

http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/ts-elb-healthcheck.html

I also noticed high latency, the time elapsed when request leaves load balance and response is received from backend. Indicates that the load balancer closed a connection because a request did not complete within the idle timeout period. You will need to find out why it is taking longer by looking at application logs, it may be also caused due to issue with the dependency of application like database performance. You can enable access logs on load balancer to get more insight. If require you can increase backend capacity or increase the idle timeout for lengthy operations. You can also enable keep alive on backend instances so that load balancer can reuse those connection (Make sure the time out of keep alive is greater that ELB timeout. Please refer to links below for more information:

http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/config-idle-timeout.html

Hello,
Looking at the output of the yum command, for some reason yum is deciding to install an old version of nginx, not the latest version in th 2015.03 repositories. This is why you are seeing the error with a missing dependency. The most common cause of this is having the wrong releasever set in /etc/yum.conf. The version you are installing is from 2013.09. You can see what yum vars you have set by running:
python -c 'import yum, pprint; yb = yum.YumBase(); pprint.pprint(yb.conf.yumvar, width=1)'

Having the wrong releasever set could also explain why you are not seeing alternatives for python.

Hi All,
I apologize if this is a thread that appears elsewhere or this question has been answered elsewhere.  But... i'm a noobie to AWS and have been searching these forums and the Internet for an answer for days!  My experience lies totally within setting up & administering hosting accounts within a cpanel environment.  So sorry if my questions may seem ""foolish"".

I've signed up for the AWS Free Tier.  We have a dynamic website that we've created on a shared hosting platform.  We feel that, once launched, this site will require a solid hosting platform and AWS was highly recommended.

I've created an EC2 instance using the t2.micro template with Amazon Linux.  I followed the setup instructions in the Getting Started documentation to the letter, installing & updating software including MySQL.  I also installed phpMyAdmin (since this is a familiar means of accessing MySQL).

I made sure that an EBS volume had been created and attached to the instance.  I uploaded all the folders/files from the website (that is currently running on our shared platform).

I created an Elastic IP for the account and assigned it to this EC2 instance.

I created the appropriate Security Groups with the standard rules as well as a rule for MySQL (inbound).

Using phpmyadmin, I created the database required using the same database & user name.  I added the user and gave it full rights to the DB (we always do this with our sites).  I exported the existing data from the current database and imported it into the new database.

Finally, I updated the DBconfig.php file that stores the database connection information.

At this point, when I access the site using either the EIP or the Public DNS, the website should come up.  Instead, all I get is a blank page with one ""SELECT..."" statement at the top of the page.  I traced this ""SELECT"" statement to a class_user.php file that is ""included"" at the beginning of the DBconfig.php.

I apologize for the wordiness, but I felt it important to fully describe the setup since I haven't seen this question before.

I'm at a loss!  I've checked, double-checked, and triple-checked the database name, hostname, username, and password.  I've tried using the public IP, internal IP, public DNS, and private DNS as the database hostname.  I've added the line ""bind-address = 0.0.0.0"" to my.cnf.  I've followed every possible lead I could find... and still no luck!

I'm sure whatever is wrong is probably staring me in the face.  But I just can't find it.  If anyone has a clue or can point me in the right direction, I'd be truly grateful!  We want to launch this site within the next 2 weeks and want to test AWS as a platform... but so far, NO LUCK!

I took a look at your instance:  i-37d2a367 and found that it is launched into EC2-Classic platform at this point in time. The instance type you wish to change your current instance to, i.e., m4.large, only supports VPC platform and this is the reason you are receiving the error when you are trying to change the instance type from m3.large to m4.large.

Okay, so the Windows Server 2008 instances you'll get from Amazon are Datacentre Edition so you will get access to all the memory available.

The limitations are baked into the installed version of Windows, so are not license limited. You cannot install a Datacentre Server 2008 License with Server Standard 2008 Media and vice-versa. What is strange is that I didn't notice the fact that the AWS Offering of 2012 is Standard and not Datacentre. This would so easily explain the issues we've seen with 2012 Server."

You don't need to do anything with your existing instance. It will not be affected by the purchase of a reservation as it is purely a matter of how you are billed.

Behind the scenes, the billing system will see that you have an unused reservation and apply it to your existing instance."

i would guess that the underlying hardware had issues and it just totally failed before the move date, which is scheduled to give you time to do your own move.  any time you get such a notice you should stop and restart the instance as soon as you can just in case of events like that."

Thank you for your response, it sounds rational now. When an instance-reboot is pending, the notification e-mail from AWS states clearly that in case that you want to perform the ""update/maintenance"" in an aerlier date, you have to manually issue a reboot command. However, in the system-reboot case which is related with the undelying hardware as you said, there was no such information. I thought that you have to wait the specific date for the maintenance. 

I will have in mind that in such cases a start/stop should do the job!

Amazon EC2	"Auto Recovery and Termination Protection
Hi,

We configured AutoRecovery upon StatusCheckFailed_System.
But it didn't work and we received the message below.

According to the message, Termination Protection seems to prevent the 'Terminate' action.
Does anyone know whether it is true for the 'Recover' action as well?
In other words, does Termination Protection have to be disabled in order to execute the 'Recover' action successfully?

Thank you in advance.

----
Dear AWS customer,

We are unable to execute the 'Recover' action on Amazon EC2 instance i-xxxxxxxx that you specified in the Amazon CloudWatch alarm AutoRecovery-EC2-i-xxxxxxxx.

You may want to check the alarm configuration to ensure that it is compatible with your instance configuration. You can also attempt to execute the action manually.

These are some possible reasons for this failure and steps you can try to resolve it:

Incompatible action selected:
 Your instance’s configuration may not be compatible with the selected action.
    * To execute the 'Terminate' action, your instance may have Termination Protection enabled. Disable this feature if you want to terminate your instance. Once you do that, the alarm will execute the action after the next applicable alarm state change.
    * To execute the 'Stop' action, your instance’s root device type must be an EBS volume. If the root device type is the instance store, select the 'Terminate' action instead. Once you do that, the alarm will execute the action after the next applicable alarm state change.

Temporary service interruption:
 There may have been an issue with Amazon CloudWatch or Amazon EC2. We have retried the action without success. You can try to execute the action manually, or wait for the next applicable alarm state change.

Sincerely,
Amazon Web Services"

With that said the email you received seems to indicate that termination protection could've been the cause. This assumes that your instance is EBS backed and not instance store, of course.

Hi infoarmy,

There are two status checks for the instance.
1. StatusCheckFailed_Instance

If you are seeing spikes in only StatusCheckFailed_Instance and not the second one, then there are issues within the instance. But if you see spikes in StatusCheckFailed_System, then there are issues with the underlying hardware.

You can design your application to be highly available and fault tolerant to prevent this kind of situations in future. For more info you can refer the documentation available at http://media.amazonwebservices.com/AWS_Building_Fault_Tolerant_Applications.pdf.

I infer from the documentation that that these are basically two different versions of for the same date and hour data feed.
My questions :
1. I am not sure what other changes can I expect across versions. I noticed a row corresponding to a new instance was added to the version 2 feed.  Can I also expect rows/columns data to be deleted/edited across different versions. 

2. Also when does a newer version of the file for the same date and hour data feed generally gets delivered after the first version is already delivered to the s3 bucket. For example, can a newer version file get delivered after 2 hours from when I receive the first file version. Is there an upper limit to the numbers of hours after which I can be sure that no more new version will be dumped for the same date and time data feed.

3. Also, different from the context above, Can there be a scenario where value in MarketPrice field is different from value in Charge field? I notice that both the fields have the same value.

Hello,

It appears you may have accidentally terminated your EC2 instance i-1df536b4. Unfortunately, we do not have any way of recovering your data if the EC2 instance has terminated. I would recommend to recover from any backups that you may have: EBS Snapshots, AMIs, or any offline backups.

By default, you can terminate your instance using the Amazon EC2 console, command line interface, or API. If you want to prevent your instance from being accidentally terminated using Amazon EC2, you can enable termination protection for the instance. For more information on termination protection, please visit the following AWS documentation here.

It is also advised to review our AWS whitepaper on 'Building Fault-Tolerant Applications in the AWS Cloud'.

I sincerely apologize for this accidental deletion that was experienced. If you have any additional questions or concerns, please do let us know.

Hello,

svchost.exe is used to run many different services in the Windows operating system. It is generally not appropriate to kill it.

From the description of your issue it sounds like you've got a memory leak on your instance -- that is, over a period of time the software on your instance consumes more and more memory, eventually getting to the point where there's nothing left.

As a first port of call, I'd recommend some general Windows tuning:


Install any required Windows Updates
Run an antivirus/antimalware scan using the tool of your choice.
Upgrade to the latest EC2Config

https://aws.amazon.com/developertools/5562082477397515

We're seeing the same issue. Windows updates are the cause.  When we disable the windows update service, the system is fine.  

But when we re-enable the service and try to check for updates, the system bogs down with 100% CPU to svchost.  It will barely respond to web requests or RDP connections.

So what you need is a NAT instance. That's the only way for those instances to reach the Internet. It's hard to say why your NAT instance didn't work. But in short, the NAT instance needs to be placed in a public subnet (any subnet with 0.0.0.0/0 pointing to an Internet Gateway) and have a public IP address (Elastic IP or dynamic). If you launch a NAT instance manually, it is important to select a NAT AMI. You will also need to disable the source/destination check for the NAT instance through the Management Console. The VPC instances that will need Internet access have to be in another subnet with 0.0.0.0/0 pointing to the NAT instance. Security groups and Network ACLs need to permit the traffic."
Amazon EC2	"Re: Instances without EIP cannot reach Internet
Hello,
thank you for contacting us.

I understand you'd like to configure your instances without a public ip address: in order to achieve this goal, you need to have a NAT instance. Please make sure that:
 - you created and configured a NAT instance for the subnet you are using to launch instances. [1] Please be sure that ""Source/Destination Checks"" for the instance is disabled.
 - routing table for the private subnet has NAT instance ENI (in ""eni-xxxxxxxx / i-xxxxxxxx"" format) as default gateway.
 - security group and network acls allow traffic to/from private subnet.

 * either on 13/08/2015 and yesterday 17/08/2015 all CPU credit balance [1][2] was used for this specific instance

Based on previous information, I suspect the issue was caused by CPU credits and instance performance were brought to baseline ones, that are lower, as you experienced.

Amazon EC2	"FTP client on EC2 instance not working in Active Mode
Hello all,

I cannot use Active Mode when talking to FTP servers outside Amazon.
The problem is caused by the PORT command, that contains the private IP of the instance instead of the public one.

I'm seeing contradictory information about this issue:


this link says that my only 2 options are: 1. configure the client to send the Public IP in the PORT command, OR 2. use FTP passive mode.
this link says that the EC2 implementation of NAT has the capability to recognize the FTP commands and replace the private IP with the public IP on-the-fly. However this is NOT happening for my instances at this time.


A bit of background:
I'm using EC2 instances to run an application that connects to various FTP servers outside my control -- they are customers' servers. Some of these servers do not accept Passive Mode, and there's nothing I can do about that.

Also, my application is some Java-based mammoth, and my development colleagues say it's out of the question to rewrite the FTP client API of their framework.

I have had this issue in some other networks that I manage, and to solve it i would load the ip_conntrack_ftp module (or its equivalent) on the router doing the NAT.

So my question is: is there is any way to convince the EC2 NAT to do this for my instances, so that the PORT parameters get automatically rewritten with the public IP ?

Thank you,
Florin"
Amazon EC2	"Re: FTP client on EC2 instance not working in Active Mode

There are a few reasons why ftp will fail with the symptoms you describe, at this point is likely that you will need to open the range of tcp ports used by your java client in order for ftp to work in active mode."

Hello Vicente,

Thank you for your advice.
Unfortunately this is not helpful. I have tried to completely open all TCP ports (0-65534), both in the EC2 Security Group and in the instance's firewall, but it did not help.

I am attaching a tcpdump on one of my FTP servers (did not obfuscate aything, the whole FTP server is temporary  ).
You can see that the PORT command reaches the server with the private IP of the instance.

Hello,

Here are a couple of recommendations that we provide to customers having trouble connecting from an EC2 instance to an external FTP server in Active mode:


The recommended FTP client to use on a Windows instance is FileZilla, http://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client. FileZilla client supports configuring the client machine's public IP address and also restricts the client machines data port range (to which the Server makes a data connection on).



The FTP client on a Linux instance will default to passive mode and should work without any problems.


We'll let you know if we come up with any additional recommendations.

Just slammed into this problem, too.

We have an external vendor that has a mis-configured ftp server, so passive doesn't work. Our AWS Linux instances can't use active.

So passive is a great workaround--if it isn't messed up at the other end.

Amazon EC2	"Re: EC2 Clone Active Directory
You can bring an instance online ""Off Network"" but it can be tricky.

Probably the best way to do this would be to put it into a VPC of its own with no access to the rest of the domain. That way you can RDP onto it and DCPROMO it.

If you cannot create a new VPC then if you can put it into its own Security Group you can restrict down the security group to allow only one Inbound Service (RDP) from your IP, and then create DENY restrictions on Outbound traffic from the instance for any traffic relating to DNS, AD, WINS, SMB etc etc.

That should put the server in isolation. It's on the same network, but cannot actually talk to anything."

It's only temporary, once you've taken it off the domain and renamed it you can change the security group back (assuming that the instance is in a VPC... You can only change the Security Groups when it's in a VPC.). My instruction was mostly for a DC... I totally misread your initial post (did a lot of that yesterday).

Thinking on it, since a deny takes preference, you can create a new SG with outbound traffic to AD Protocols blocked and just apply that as another security group to the instance. It will allow you to remove from the domain (then configure EC2Config to rename the box when it comes up, followed by imaging the box...?). Once done, you can remove the restrictive security group and you're back to a non-member server."

The NAT instance enables instances that don't have public IPs to access the Internet. You would normally set up a VPC route table entry for 0.0.0.0/0, pointing to the NAT instance. It means that all traffic from that subnet that isn't covered by another route table entry should go through the NAT instance.

Amazon EC2	"Elastic Load Balancer dropping client connections?
I was doing a micro load test on a simple REST service. I'm using JMeter to throw some continuous load at the ELB (about 50-60 qps) and then adding some EC2 instances to the ELB to see how things scale.

Often when adding a new instance to the ELB, the client will get a handful of socket exceptions (reset, closed). As far as I can tell, these issues aren't caused by the actual EC2 server instances. They report no errors in their logs that correlate with these drops. This can be done with a fully warmed up instance that is removed from the load balancer, then added back in again, so it's not a warmup issue on the EC2 server side of things.

I've also enabled the access logs on the ELB and see nothing except 200s in that log, so it's not showing any issues there either.

So, the question is, is this standard? Is this expected? Do the ELBs occasionally drop client connections when reconfiguring themselves for new backend instances or scaling events?

If you haven't backed up the instance then a rollback will be out of the question.

Try shutting the instance down, detaching the root volume and attaching it as a non-root volume on another windows instance. It is very possible to modify your Windows Firewall from accessing the registry files on the volume, then detach the volume and re-add it as the root volume on your initial instance. 

Personally, I would actually disable Windows Firewall. The easiest option from the Registry.

Are you launching the instance from the AMI, or are you shutting it down to image it? Have you tried using the ""NoReboot"" option?

If you launch from the AMI, does this work? Do you have any dead machines for troubleshooting purposes?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: EC2 instance is bugged after an AMI
Hi thetechieuk,

Thanks for your answer.

Concerning your questions, it happened already several times with different instances. In some cases, I had just umount the s3fs (I also changed the /etc/fstab file to be sure to delete it) and I wanted to have a new image without this mountpoint. When I asked to create the image, the machine didn't start again correctly. In others, I just wanted to create an extra backup of my machine without any changes. The machine reboots for the image and never starts correctly again.

Before asking the creation of the images, I'm not sure I had shutted down the instances. Should I ? I didn't see the no reboot option. I'm going to take a look at it.

About the IPs, yes I'm sure to use the correct ones. For one of the instances I lost, I even had a elastic IP so I'm sure it didn't change after the image.

I terminated the troubleshooting machines and deleted the wrong images. Wasn't that a good idea? Actually, I tried to create instances from the AMIs that broke the machines and they were broke as well. I had to use an older AMI to save my machines."
Amazon EC2	"Re: EC2 instance is bugged after an AMI
Are you actually able to just perform an instance stop/start on an instance? Does that break the instance?

As for Elastic IP - Don't assume it's actually picked up the right IP... We've had to put code in to make sure the instance is re-assigned the EIP if it loses it after a reboot.

By default the ""CreateImage"" process will reboot the machine to flush the disks prior to imaging them. 

If this is reproducable it would be handy to have one there that can be checked. You can probably get Support to look at it, or you can hire a 3rd party to investigate. It sounds like there is something amiss with your volumes, but without seeing it I'm not sure where you'd start."

Hello,

I did take a look at your instance  i-af8e2d04 and it appears to be in stopped state. We will not be able to see the Elastic IP,security groups, VPC route tables, Network ACLs associated with your instance when in stopped state. Is it possible for you start the instance so that I or anyone from AWS side could table a look at your instance settings?

Coming to your query with regard to the difference in availability zones, Since the availability zones are different, the VPC subnets in which your instances were launched also will be different. You can have same/different route tables for each subnet in the same VPC. So, I would recommend you to take a look at the VPC route table rules which are associated with your problematic instance as well. 

Is it that you are only facing issues to connect to port 8080? If you are only facing issues in connecting to a particular port, then it will not be a route table or routing issue, but would be more likely related to Security Group/Network ACL/Firewall or SELinux running on your instance level.

You might want to have a look at the web server logs. Make sure you are returning 200 OK in response to health check requests. Everything else, including redirects, will make the health check fail."
Amazon EC2	"Re: loadbalancer stuck on ""instance registration is still in progress""
The health check returns a nice 200 OK so i do not think that is the problem. At least i do not think so."
Amazon EC2	"Re: loadbalancer stuck on ""instance registration is still in progress""
Hi, that instance is only configured to allow connections to port 8080 from a single IP which is not that of the load balancer so that is why the health check is failing. Please allow the load balancer to send traffic to that port. See the following page for more info:
http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/elb-security-features.html (Using Security Groups with Elastic Load Balancing)

Alternatively you could just open up port 8080 to the world (0.0.0.0/0). Hope this helps.  If you have questions, let me know.

Amazon EC2	"Windows Server Clock Skew
I have a Windows Server 2012 instance (i-4230cf2c) that keeps going drastically out of sync with the correct time (6+ minutes) when it syncs to the hardware clock. This is impacting my application since authenticated API calls with a timestamp are skewed outside of the acceptable window.

I've increased the Windows Time Service NTP client poll frequency, but (aside from being a bad network citizen), when I review the system logs this only temporarily fixes the problem until the OS re-syncs with the hardware clock. 

Questions:
How do I prevent the hardware clock sync? 
Or else, Amazon, can you sync the host hardware clock? 

Details: I see these two events in the system log battling it out back and forth:

Source: Kernel-General
EventID: 1

The system time has changed to ‎2014‎-‎01‎-‎28T20:15:05.500000000Z from ‎2014‎-‎01‎-‎28T20:20:56.252273800Z.

Amazon EC2	"Re: Windows Server Clock Skew
Hi Michael,

The machine seems to be resetting itself back hourly at 40 minutes past the hour (I've been updating it manually today so that our sync processes don't fail).  As with the original poster, I have System Log entries with ""Kernal-General"" as the source stating ""Change Reason: System time synchronized with the hardware clock.""

After syncing with the host/hardware, it is reverting to a time roughly 2 minutes in the past.  Is it conceivable the the hardware's clock may be inaccurate?

My concern comes from the fact that I have another instance created from the same AMI (actually, created from an image of the problematic server).  Other than the fact that one is an m1.medium (i-6cbf111c) and one is an m1.large (i-b2c9eac9), they are identical and reside within the same availability zone.

The large instance displays the correct time, which makes me worry that the PV Drivers are not related (I would assume that both instances would have the same issue, since they are using the same drivers).  Is this an incorrect assumption?

Are there other possible causes, or should I focus on the PV Drivers?  The provided instructions appear to be Windows Server 2008 specific, and I'm running Windows Server 2012 standard on both instances; I'm not sure if that changes the situation at all, so I wanted to mention.

In general, any guidance or ""next steps"" would be greatly appreciated."
Amazon EC2	"Re: Windows Server Clock Skew
I'm afraid I'm not sure what the actual issue is with respect to the PV drivers, aside from people experiencing issues with clock sync, so I can't say why it would happen on one but not the other.  

It probably isn't a UTC/GMT problem (which would be about 35s off) or a time zone problem (Which would be full or 1/2 hours off). The host clocks skewing would cause this problem, but both of the instances you quoted are on similar hardware that are both syncing correctly.

That leaves a known -- but not well-understood -- problem with the PV drivers.

Amazon EC2	"PCI DSS Trustwave
Hello just was wondering how to do something with 
During the course of the scan, TrustKeeper detected a change in its ability to communicate with some services on the remote host. In some cases, this may be caused by network security devices actively blocking the vulnerability scan, which it may perceive as a threat. In other cases, an intermediate network device, or the host itself, may be unable to cope with the vulnerability scan.
It's often very difficult to tell the difference between these two scenarios, but in either case, this behavior significantly impacts the ability of this vulnerability scanning service to detect vulnerabilities on the remote host, resulting in an inconclusive vulnerability assessment. The PCI ASV Program Guide 1.0 requires that PCI ASV scan customers have a scan performed on all in-scope hosts without interference from IDS/IPS; if such interference is detected, then the ASV is required to fail the scan. Examples of products and devices that provide active measures that may interfere with the scan are firewall and intrusion detection systems (IDS) with active countermeasures, intrusion prevention systems (IPS), web-application firewalls (WAF), and distributed-denial of service (DDoS) mitigation products.
In order to achieve a conclusive vulnerability assessment of the remote host, the products and devices responsible for interfering with this scan may need to be temporarily configured to permit scanning without interference. This normally takes the form of adding the IP addresses of this scanning service to the ""whitelist"" of the product or device. Please ensure the following network blocks have full, unobstructed, access in order to more accurately perform a vulnerability scan: 204.13.201.0/24, 64.37.231.0/24.

Amazon EC2	"Re: Should I save to root device?
I would say that it is entirely up to you. Having a single EBS volume is not unusual. The EBS root volume, and any additional EBS volumes you attach, provide persistent storage. They will at least be around until you decide to terminate the instance. Be careful with any storage that doesn't correspond to a mounted EBS volume, though. In particular, xvdb looks very much like instance storage. That is not a safe place for any data that you care about. Instance storage is tied to a particular instance (can't move between physical hosts) and certain failure scenarios and actions can render it inaccessible or result in deletion."

When you stop and start your instance, the instance gets moved to a different underlying hardware. After the stop and start, your instance has started on a different underlying hardware which is healthy.

While you are not incorrect, that is viable way of getting around the issue. Depending on your use case, an alternative/easier solution is possible. 

Assuming there is already a role attached to the instance in question, You can simply edit the permission of said role to suit your current needs. 
The only down side to this is, if you have more instances attached the to the same role and the other instances should not have their permissions changed. 
The permission changes will affect all instances attached to this role.

I saw that page, but I'm inclined to believe the README file in the new version takes precedence over a web page.

In any case, I've created an RPM for AMI Linux that builds and installs Mailman 2.1.18-1 by modifying the package for version 2.1.12 (mostly just tweaking the patch files).  I also created one for a new Python library Mailman now depends on.  The Mailman package upgraded cleanly on my server and the mailing lists seem to be functioning correctly.  Is there some way I can contribute these new packages so others can use them?

FWIW, it was very easy to update the RPM version from the source.

Grab a new bit of Python required, http://www.dnspython.org/kits/1.12.0/dnspython-1.12.0.tar.gz
Unpack and install:
python setup.py install

Grab and unpack from https://launchpad.net/mailman.
Build and install (set defaults to override the RPM provided so-out-of-date it breaks DMARC version. You could install leave off the prefix options and remove the AWS RPM, but I was upgrading an existing list service):

Amazon EC2	"*ec2-EBS*
I am contracted to design a web portal that will allow my customer (amazon user) the ability to move data akin to client side encryption to EC2. The constraints are as follows: 1. It has to has to be cost effective GB/Month. 2. S3 is not a solution since it cost more but seem faster. 2. Must be accessed from anywhere in the world like S3.

What they want to accomplish:

1. Move and store encrypted data within amazon region that is the most cost effective and fast for EBS--US East is preferred in this case.
2. All backup or snapshots will be sent to a different region of EBS bucket instead of S3 like say US West. Just the redundancy needed for BCP and DRP.
3. They want manage their master keys for encryption.

What I think:

I think the solution is more like cost effective in all. I am not sure if S3 could be a better idea in this case.

My assumptions:
I think that amazon will charge for encrypted data volume since that will increase the file size especially using AES which involved IV for very large files. This company is moving large files on a regularly.

If my assumption is wrong how will amazon deal with server-side encryption where I have 10GB of data to encrypt and after the encryption I now have 14GB. Will I only pay for the 10 GB? In this case can you see that client-side encryption could win the data depending on how they will deal with both.

Conclusion:
What do you guys think about this approach? Let me know if there is something missing. Why is EBS a good choice here? Why not S3?

Thanks."
Amazon EC2	"Re: *ec2-EBS*
Are you referring to network performance or to storage performance when you say that S3 is faster? In my experience, S3 is extremely slow while EBS provides much better performance and with provisioned iops, guaranteed performance. The difference of course is price. I'm in the process of testing out new EBS volumes but I'm expecting EBS without provisioned iops to be substantially faster than S3."

Hello, 

The issue with the ACLs you have is the order that they are processed.

Entry 	Protocol 	Port range 	Source 	 	 	Action
200 	TCP 	 	80 	 	192.232.255.240/32  	deny

You don't.

The AWS billing system checks the list of active reserved instances against the instances you have running. For those instances that have a matching free reserved instance you get charged the reserved instance rate, otherwise you get the on demand rate. This is why you need to make sure the reserved instance matches the current"
Amazon EC2	"Re: How To Move From On Demand To Reserved?
The reservation system is pretty opaque, and a bit scary. You have to buy a reserved instance that matches your running instances exactly (region, instance type, availability zone, Windows, the correct edition of SQL Server), and there's no feedback or confirmation that you have reserved something useful for you. And once you've bought the reserved instance, you're stuck with it."

Looking at the console I can see a few things have gone wrong on your instance:

Firstly a t2.micro is a too small to run a LAMP stack of any real use and only just meets the minimum requirements according to the RHEL documents: https://access.redhat.com/articles/rhel-limits

Login: [3433178.797897] pool invoked oom-killer: gfp_mask=0x280da, order=0, oom_score_adj=0

Looking at the 10G root volume  you have 30 IOPS baseline performance that can briefly boost to 3000 IOPS. This will become a problem once your site become actively used as the database will use up the IO credits relatively fast.

This may have stemmed from the OOM killer killing the wrong processes, you will have to look at the kernel logs to see the full output as I can only see a small snippet.

My biggest suspicions are that the instance is too small, this can cause unforeseeable errors to occur as a result of the OOM killer and secondly that selinux permissions have not been set on the files in the web directory. 

A few things you can try:
1) Change your instance type to something larger. A t2.medium should do it for testing. Check the memory usage once you have completed your setup. 
 free -m

2) Check if selinux is getting in the way ( RHEL comes with selinux on by default).
 setstatus 
 sudo sealert -a /var/log/audit/audit.log

3) Try using the standard Amazon Linux AMI, it is based off RedHat, if it works then compare the differences between the settings on the RedHat AMI and Amazon Linux  ( *Note the Amazon Linux AMI is based of RHEL 6 not RHEL7 so there will be some vast OS architecture differences)

Other things to look at: 

Is apache listening on all IPs or only localhost?
Check what ports are open on each IP and check the if the apache configuration is listing on all IPs.

In your security groups you have exposed ssh to the world. You need to lock this down to only the IP range that you will access the server from. It is imperative as publics IPs are very often scanned for an open SSH port. 
 SSH TCP 22 0.0.0.0/0 


I cannot be sure what mode selinux is running in. If its in passive mode or disable it will have no affect.

Philip,

I can see in the log file that the RedHat instance is much healthier.
Ok, good, a little progress.

The problem is definitely somewhere in the configuration on that instance. Perhaps a local firewall?

I agree both instances share the same Security Group.

Can you check the existing local firewall rules that your have.
sudo iptables -nL

I also did ""sudo service iptables stop"".  The system responded with ""Unit iptables.service not loaded"".

*Note  do not post the output of this.
I will say, from looking at the output, I don't think this is the problem.

Is apache listening on all IPs or only localhost?
The httpd.conf contains: Listen *:80

Check what ports are open on each IP and check the if the apache configuration is listing on all IPs.

If there is something else in this regard you need me to do, please be specific.  Sorry, this area is a bit new to me.
I have not modified the default installation.  Did not add a .conf file with virtual hosts.

netstat -tapn

It seems that there is a rule for httpd to listen on all IPs, but only for tcp6.  Is that ok?
Security Group rules seem to be written in ipv4 notation.

This has been addressed.

Amazon EC2	"Re: Unable to reach website publicly
Hello,

Since selinux is running in enforcing mode you will need to set the contexts on the web files so that apache can present them to the world. 
For the moment I suggest using the following procedure:

1) Set selinux to permissive mode (The ""-P"" makes it survive reboots)
 sudo setenforce -P Permissive 

 2) Get the application running.
Having selinux in permissive mode means that it will report on misconfiguration and breach attempts but not block them.
This will allow you to focus on your application.

Doing connectivity tests this is what i get.
[ec2-user@awscli ~]$ telnet xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 82                                                                                                                 
Trying xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx ...
^C
[ec2-user@awscli ~]$ telnet xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx  80
Trying xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx ...
telnet: connect to address xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx : No route to host
[ec2-user@awscli ~]$ telnet xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx  8282
Trying xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx ...
telnet: connect to address xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx : No route to host
[ec2-user@awscli ~]$ telnet xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx   22
Trying xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx...
^C

So there is connectivity to your server but something is still blocking the traffic.
I'm not completely familiar with RHEL 7 yet but some research tells me that its using firewalld not iptables which explains the error you saw earlier.  Try this command to stop the local firewall. 
 sudo service firewalld stop

If this works then you need to disable firewalld completely or add rules to it.
 sudo systemctl disable firewalld

 3) Re-enable selinux and use the RedHat documents to help you work through selinux errors.

Amazon EC2	"EC2 small instance unresponsive periodically - cannot ssh
Instance: i-9bf62896 - m1.small - us-west-2a

We are having issues with a small ec2 instance that becomes periodically unresponsive. The period is random, 5 days, 7 days and some times 10 days. Once it becomes unresponsive, SSH does not work. So we have to reboot it from the AWS Web console. Once it reboots, everything is back to normal again. 

The instance has Ruby on Rails and MySQL running on it. We havent seen any kind of load on the server - its used very rarely. CPU graphs show minimal spikes, there are no errors that we found in the syslogs or ssh logs. 

Our instance was getting hit with a lot of SSH attempts, so we installed fail2ban and its blocking the bad IPs. 

Other than that, we cannot think of anything that can make the instance unresponsive. 

Any suggestions on how to find the problem ?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: EC2 small instance unresponsive periodically - cannot ssh
Hi,

I had a look at your instance and I have a suspicion that this might be IO related. You have a 20G EBS volume which gives you 60 IOPS base line performance. Looking at the volumes statistics I can see there are a few usages spikes. My theory is that in those spikes you might be exhausting your burst IOPs credit, to prove or disprove this theory I need to have recent specific timestamps of when you see the issues so I can drill into the graphs.

Looking at the network graphs I can see that installing fail2ban has made a significant improvement to your network usage. The SSH attempts you saw are brute force hacking attempts. Your security groups are far too open especially for SSH. You should lock the ports down to known IP ranges as much as possible. Only expose what you need to to minimize the number sources an attack can come from. This will also help reduce the overall load on your instance. 

Have a look at this white paper about securing your services in AWS.
Link: https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/Security/Intro_to_AWS_Security.pdf

Looking a the underlying infrastructure there is a minor flag that has been raised however its unclear what the affect on instances is if any at all. Try stopping and starting the instance to move away from the issue. A stop and start moves an instance to different underlying infrastructure where a reboot simply restarts the instance in the same place. 

CAUTION
You do have an instance store attached to this instance, a stop and a start will wipe all data from the instance store . Be sure to backup any data on the instance store that you with to keep before performing a stop and a start.
CAUTION

I hope this helps.

Hello,

Unfortunately it is much harder to troubleshoot an instance once it is terminated. However, it does appear that the status checks were triggered due to an instance status check failure and not a system status check failure. In other words it looks like the problem was within the instance itself i.e. not caused by AWS hardware issues. You can confirm this by comparing these two status checks in the CloudWatch console:

StatusCheckFailed_Instance

Hi, yes. Why was the IP address adding not allowed? Did you format it correctly (eg. 54.355.417.15/32)

Also, if you are in a VPC then you would be better adding something that allows internal only communication unless you want it to be accessible outside. While testing, I usually allow all of the CIDR that the instance is in access, then narrow it down if needed. You say you have added the web server security group as an inbound rule?

Amazon EC2	"Re: Notified - failed an instance or a system status check, what to do next?
Hi Mayandi,

1. Is this issue happened because of my application traffic, CPU usage or memory level?
This particular issue has nothing to do with your application, there was something in the surrounding infrastructure that failed or had an error. I realize this is not much to go on but there is nothing you could have done to predict or prevent it from happening. 

2. What type of status check failure encountered, is it SYSTEM STATUS CHECK OR INSTANCE STATUS CHECK failure?
In this case it was the reachability status check that failed, our systems could not verify that your instance could be reached and so  a failure flag was raised. You can see these checks by selecting the instance on the EC2 instances page and viewing the information about the instance. 

3. Is there any preliminary steps can be taken to avoid this problem?
4. How do i protect my instance from status check failure?
These are the money questions, people have spent millions to answer this and we now have the cloud, but it actually comes down to architecting for failure. Everything fails at some point so the question is when and how do you react to it. 

Lets take a web server running on one instance for example:

Failure scenario:
One day the file system encounters an error, the operating system reboots and when it starts back up again a file system check runs for about 5 minutes and manges to fix the errors. As is the website would suffer an outage whilst the reboot and file system checks takes place. 

There are many ways to work around this kind of problem so I will list 2 simple solutions at a high level.

Solution 1 : Wear the instance outage but have a content delivery network (CDN) in front.
In this case the users off the site may not even notice that the instance died, the CDN has most if not all of the website cached and continues to serve the visitors from its cache only showing errors on parts of the website that contain dynamic content.

This is suitable for most small websites and also give you the capability of serving a huge number of visitors with only 1 instance.

Solution 2: Use a load balancer  to distribute traffic between 2 instances.
In the case there is no down time or errors at all, at most there is a connection reset for the visitors on the dead instance.

This is suitable for websites that have a larger amount of content that changes more frequently but it is significantly more complex to set up as the web servers need to share data amongst themselves so they can provide the same content regardless of which instance a user gets directed to by the load balancer. This shared data requirement is what causes all the complexity and with complexity comes more cost. 

The best assumption you can make is that your instance will fail at some point so you need to decide how you want to react to that. Reliability is not cheap or simple and every use case is different depending on how far you are willing to go. A bank goes as far as technologically possible, spending enormousness amounts of money to prevent even the smallest blip. Someones blog can survive a small outage with zero repercussions and so does not spend  anything near a banks budgets and just wheres the outage instead.

So instead of protecting your instance you should protect your service by building around failure. 
Here are some reference architectures to give you an idea of what is possible in this space with AWS.
Link: https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/

I hope this information is useful and helps you to protect your service as your use case requires.

Amazon EC2	"Unable to remote to instance due to expired password
Hello,

After creating my EC2 instance, I created a new account and disabled the administrator account. The new account, however, had an expiring password. I've done this on another EC2 instance running Windows 2008 without any issue. Whenever my password there expires, I am prompted to change it. However, this new instance is Windows 2012. I wonder if they've changed it somehow since I can no longer change the password. Upon connecting, I am greeted with the following:

""This user account's password has expired. The password must change in order to logon. Please update the password or contact your system administrator or technical support.""

Am I out of luck? I've seen that there are ways to recover the instance via launching a second instance and attaching the drive. I was hoping there was something else that might work though. If this is my only option, it seems this is a ding against the security of the system since either I have to leave Administrator enabled, or I have to set my password to never expire. Or I have to remember to change it before it does expire.

Looking for suggestions. Thanks.
Lushi"
Amazon EC2	"Re: Unable to remote to instance due to expired password
Hi Lushi,

Thank you for reaching out through the forums.

Attaching the drive to an accessible instance is  the only way to recover from this.

Here are the steps to follow. 
Create a lower version of EC2 Windows 2008 instance
    Stop the affected instance
    Detach the root volume from affected instance and attach it with your newly created instance as secondary volume
    Start the new instance and login to that
    Go to the Drive that you have additionally added (affected volume)
    Go to affected volume drive:\Program Files\Amazon\Ec2ConfigService\Settings
    Open config.xml in notepad
    Change the value of Ec2SetPassword to Enabled
    Change the value of Ec2HandleUserData to Enabled
    Save the file
    Detach the affected volume and reattch it with your affected instance as root device (/dev/sda1)
    From EC2 management console, select the affected instance and right click on it
    Click Instance settings >> View/Change User Data
    Copy and pasted the below script (with script tag. Please be careful of copy/paste, it may add some unwanted character)
<script>
net user administrator /active:yes
</script>
    

    Click on Save
    Start the instance
    You should be able to access the instance using local Administrator account

As you have mentioned it is best practice to disable that account. In your scenario it would be beneficial to use Active Directory to manage the accounts on your servers rather than using local user accounts. So if a password expires then the domain administrator can reset it in Active director without the need to touch any  server the can cause an impact to your service.

Hope this help.

Mount the volume on he new instance using the command: sudo mount /dev/sdf /<mount directory> (In general use this command: sudo mount <device_name> <mount_point>)
Access the volume and change/fix the permissions on the 'ec2-user' directory using the command 'chmod'
Unmount the volume using the command: sudo umount /dev/sdf (In general use this command: sudo umount <device_name>)
Detach the secondary volume from the new instance and  attach it back to the original instance as a root volume i.e., /dev/sda1
Start the original instance

Amazon EC2	"Strange Disk Spike cause the server to hang
Dear AWS stuff,

Please help, this happens for a long time. From time to time, our ec2 instance would have a disk spike that suddenly cause the disk usage jump from 20% to 80-100%, and make the server hanging. The cpu usage was normal all the time, 20% to 30%. CPU is usually climbing before the spike, but it's always in the range and 30+% at most.

To make the server workable again, we have to restart many times. But sometimes, restarting won't work. We have to create AMI, and launch it again. That will work, and disk usage back to 20% again.

At first, we thought it might has something to do with the process running. But only process running is php scripts. Now we suspect it is hardware faulty, otherwise it won't require a AMI relaunch to make it work again. Perhaps EC2 is not reliable as we think, we have other issues before, but this is the most recent and critical causing outage."

Hello.

I saw the highlighted post on Amazon EBS encryption now being available.  I also noticed when adding storage while creating a new EC2 instance, the root volume is ""Not Encrypted"".

If not, is this a feature that would be considered?

As background, currently I use a service to provide encrypted disks.  I have been moving some items from the root volume (like /home/ec2-user/.ssh) to the encrypted disks for additional security and creating symbolic links from the root volume to the appropriate location on the encrypted disk.

I'm trying to get a secondary private IP address on my fresh Amazon Linux instance. The documentation (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/MultipleIP.html) states,


After you assign a secondary private IP address to your instance, you need to configure the operating system on your instance to recognize the secondary private IP address.

If you are using Amazon Linux, the ec2-net-utils package can take care of this step for you. It configures additional network interfaces that you attach while the instance is running, refreshes secondary IP addresses during DHCP lease renewal, and updates the related routing rules.


But the ec2-net-utils package doesn't seem to bring up this secondary IP automatically. The docs for ec2-net-utils doesn't talk about secondary private IP addresses, and it's unclear where one configures it manually (I was able to find Ubuntu instructions).

I can manually bring up the interface with ifconfig eth1 add 10.10.10.128

EIPs are added and removed from ENIs during DHCP lease renewal. If they're present at launch time, then the instance should come up with everything configured. Otherwise lease renewal happens every 20 minutes (approximately) and the changes should be visible at that point.

The logic for adding EIPs as secondary IP addresses is in the rewrite_aliases function in this file:
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ec2net-functions


These commands should refresh the list and show all current EIPs for each ENI:
sudo service network restart
ip addr li

Amazon EC2	"EC2 instance ""i-4cb5b6af"" stops responding requests
Hi, 

My instance ""i-4cb5b6af"" stops working after a few minutes (no more than five). If I reboot it, it works again for a few minutes and then stops. It's a very simple app, the monitor says its ok (low cpu, low network). What can I do?? I'm monitoring locally using ping, I can see that ping fails when the service becomes inaccessible.

Amazon EC2	"Re: EC2 Instance stop responding frequently while everything looks fine
Hello, 

Have you taken a look at CPU and/or memory utilization? I notice this is a t2.micro instance, our smallest current generation instance type. If a larger amount of users hitting your site is causing it to stop responding then you're likely hitting some type of cap. I'd recommend: 

1. Monitor CPU and memory utilization, as you may need to scale up the instance size to handle more connections. You can monitor CPU utilization with CloudWatch, and can enable CloudWatch to monitor memory with the following utility:
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/mon-scripts-perl.html

2. Look into optimizing your web server, and verifying the maximum number of simultaneous connections. If using Apache, the following guide details how to optimize performance: 
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/misc/perf-tuning.html

Regards,
Nick"
Amazon EC2	"Re: EC2 Instance stop responding frequently while everything looks fine
Hey Nick,

Thank you for the response.

We checked the 'monitoring' on our console, CPU utilization has never surpassed 50%. I can't seem to find the memory utilization, maybe it is the problem? Also, what is the difference using the CloudWatch, do they have different results?

Thanks again!

Amazon EC2	"Re: EC2 Instance stop responding frequently while everything looks fine
Hello, 

By default you're not going to be able to see memory utilization in CloudWatch. The OS controls where and how memory is utilized, which is why an additional tool running on the OS is required to upload statistics to CloudWatch. You don't have to use CloudWatch to monitor memory, but it will help track memory utilization if you're not able to duplicate the issue immediately. 

You can read more on CloudWatch metrics here: 
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring_ec2.html

Regards,
Nick"
Amazon EC2	"Re: EC2 Instance stop responding frequently while everything looks fine
Hey Nick,

We did the memory utilization monitoring script on CloudWatch, and it would went up to 88% then the site breaks down, there is insufficient data after that point. Do you think we need to upgrade to the next tier at this point?

Hello,

I have created a new Amazon AWS EC-2 instance in their free-tier account type. I have successfully configured the settings of the server and then generated an Elastic IP which i linked to my Public IP of my EC-2 instance. 

Now i logged in into my instance using SSH and then transferred all files on my website to the necessary folders. After saving all files when i open the Elastic IP directly in browser URL then it opens the home page of my website but clicking on any other link takes me to my old server. 

I then created a Amazon Route 53 hosting zone and generated nameserver and replaced by current domain nameservers with it. But now I am unable to ping my elastic IP address. I have checked in my console panel and the instance is running perfectly well.

I'm trying to connect from local to an EC2 instance that has mongo listening on 27017.

Thank you for the post.

I took a look at your instance: i-fae305f5 and found that everything at the infrastructure level is operating normally at this point. Also, I checked connection on ports 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP) and I was able to connect successfully from our end. Please see below the commands I performed to check this:

nc -v 52.X.X.X 80

The above outputs mean that the instance is accepting connections on ports 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP).

Hi Nancy, 

Are you still having issues connecting with this instance? I see that instance was recently rebooted - within the past hour. 

If you are still unable to connect to the instance it is most likely an internal misconfiguration. From our end everything appears to be functioning; we are still able to reach port 22 and port 80 via the command line. 

The next step would be to take the root volume of the instance and attach it to another instance as a secondary volume and investigate why these services aren't running. 

Here is a link to our documentation on detaching an EBS volume:
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-detaching-volume.html

If you no longer need this EC2 instance, can you attempt to try a 'terminate' action again. If you do encounter any further issues, please do let us know.

Amazon EC2	"EC2 instance unscheduled restart and loss of all ephemeral disks and data
Hi EC2 Support,

My EC2 instance i-ea7bffb4 has suffered an unexpected reboot. This is evident from the `uptime` command that shows system up-time as 31 minutes. No one from our team has gone for the reboot.

System log from EC2 console has no information about reboot. Could you explain why this happened?

Also, all our ephemeral disks and their data is gone. This data is critical as we have many folders with data that we cache to speed up site. Rebuilding all this data will take loads of time.

Is there a way we can mount back to the older ephemeral disks or get the data from them back?

An urgent response will be highly appreciated.

Need help establishing some sort of data pricing from Amazon ec2 . I am going to be streaming video in huge quantities and Amazon has no contact phone number to determine what kind of pricing structure they can offer for massive video streaming services and storage . How do I ""guess"" how much my users will stream and then scale it up from there ? look at you tube . I know they run on google servers now . But what if my app gets that magnitude within one year ?

Amazon EC2	"Re: Amazon data pricing and volume capability
Hi,

A good place to start looking at your estimated prices would be to use the simply monthly calculator found here:

http://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html

You can put in what you initially want infrastructure wise (Compute/Storage) and estimates on data transfer and it will give you a cost estiamte.

AWS will be able to handle your requirements providings its been architectured correctly.  As a note on that, Netflix entire business is built on AWS so I dont think you will have an issue with streaming!  

Hope this helps,

Amazon EC2	"Re: Can only connect to certain instance types
Hi, 

Thanks for that information, I can see the c4 instance is not responding to arp which usually means the network stack on the instance is down. The back end is all fine so I suspect something may be going wrong during the boot process or just after. I can see an IP and the correct route is assigned during boot but why it does not respond is still elusive.

The instance looks like its configured correctly so we will have to dig a little deeper to narrow it down. 

Can you try these 2 steps:

1)  Stop the instance and attach the root volume to another working instance then have a look at the log files for any errors.
2) Create another instance using a different instance type, try a c3 and see if the issue repeats. 

This will give us  a clue if you see any errors in the logs and prove that the issue is specifically related to the c4 instance type. Let me know if you need further information on performing those steps.

PhillipR"
Amazon EC2	"Re: Can only connect to certain instance types
I'm sorry but I don't think I know how to follow step 1:  Firstly, the 'stop' option is greyed out, and only 'reboot' and 'terminate' are available.  Secondly, I'm not sure how to 'attach the root volume to another working instance'.  And after I do that I won't know where to look to find any log files.  If you don't mind could you break this down into more noob-friendly steps.

I did create the c3 instance and it is working.  I made the observation that the two working instances have a public DNS server such as 
ec2-xxxxxxxx.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com

whereas the c4 instance does not, the field is blank.

Amazon EC2	"Re: Can only connect to certain instance types
Hi, 

Apologies I did not realize that these were spot instances, that is the reason you cannot stop it.  The procedure is mostly the same but new information has come up and you may not need to do that. 

Looking at your instance again something seems to have changed and the status checks say arp is working. 
Following this I found that you are missing a route in one of your main routing tables. 
Basically your instance does not know how to get to the outside world. The route table will take any traffic that is not local and send it to the internet gateway for that VPC:  igw-9310d4f6 but it needs to be told how to do that.
You need to add a route to the internet, add a route that looks like this to the routing table rtb-14c16171
0.0.0.0/0   igw-9310d4f6
Here is the document that explains how to add a route:
Link : http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Route_Tables.html#AddRemoveRoutes

For more details on VPC routes have a look here : 
Link: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Route_Tables.html

If you are still having issues then proceed with the steps below:

I have provided both the GUI instructions and command line commands. 
If you have not used the AWS CLI before you can find all the setup and usage details in the link below.
Link: http://aws.amazon.com/cli/

1) Take a snapshot of the volume.
Follow the instructions in the link below or you can use the aws cli command provided.
Link:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-creating-snapshot.html
Link:  http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-snapshot.html
aws ec2 create-snapshot --region us-west-1 --volume-id vol-f40d6111 --description ""Back up snapshot of vol-f40d6111  from  i-1fa317df""
 
This will output the new snapshots details to your screen.
2) Create a new volume from the snapshot. 
Follow the instructions in the link below or you can use the aws cli command provided. 
Link: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-restoring-volume.html
Link: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/create-volume.html
aws ec2 create-volume --region us-west-1 --availability-zone us-west-1c --snapshot-id <insert snapshot ID here> --volume-type gp2

Amazon EC2	"feature request - comments for security group rules
Hello,

I'm not sure whether this is the right place to talk about feature requests, but I'll try 

It would be extremely useful if we could add comments to our security group rules. I have no idea of how SGs work on your backend, but it sounds like a very simple feature to implement and I really believe it would help users to avoid incidents.

I'm sure that a lot of users implement and maintain complex and big security groups (specially on VPC, where you can also control outbound traffic) and sometimes you simply forget why a rule is there. You have no clue whether it should be present or not. 

What makes it worse is that sometimes you even end up deleting a rule because you believe it's useless and no longer required, but in the end you figure it was not, meaning you caused a service disruption which has happened to me a couple times after 3 years of AWS/EC2, I confess =]

Also, it's much easier to read a comment than reading something like

Custom TCP Rule
TCP
12000 - 12100
0.0.0.0/0

Imagine that you were just hired and you started to get to know your employer's cloud. You look at this rule an thinks ""What the heck does it mean?"". Nothing... really. However, if it had a comment like ""Passive FTP port range""... Wow! your life just changed. Same example is pertinent when you have multiple sysadmins working on the same AWS account.

Hello,

Our server is flooded with TCP connections.  The CPU monitor in amazon monitoring is constantly at 100%.
Can someone please help fix this problem?

Thanks"
Amazon EC2	"Re: HELP - Server flooded with connections
Hello, 

First you'd want to figure out if these connections are malicious or not. Based, off of your description, you really have a few options: 

1. If you suspect these connections are malicious, you can block these requests. You can do this with Windows Firewall or IPTables at the OS level, or you can use Security Groups or Network ACLs to filter this traffic before it reaches your instance. You can read more on SG and ACLs here:
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Security.html

2. If you want to support these connections, you'll need to scale up to handle this traffic. You can look into increasing your instance size to handle these connections, or you can even utilize Auto Scaling to help handle this. You can read more on Auto Scaling here: 
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AutoScaling/latest/DeveloperGuide/WhatIsAutoScaling.html

3. You could also look into optimizing your software/OS to better handle these connections. This step will vary on what application is monitoring this port and it's configuration options.

Amazon EC2	"Re: Sometimes the service become no response with ""Connection reset by peer ""
Hello, 

It looks like you've terminated your instance. However based on your description it sounds like you may be maxing out memory utilization. This is especially apparent given that you're using a t2.micro and only have 1 GiB of memory. You'd want to look into monitoring memory utilization manually, or you can look into setting up CloudWatch to monitor memory utilization with the following: 
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/mon-scripts-perl.html

Assuming you're using Apache, you can also look into optimizing memory utilization as well:

Hi Mike,

I understand you want to detach vol-250413d0. Upon reviewing this EBS volume, I am able to see it is the root EBS volume of EC2 instance i-037ac1c6. You are unable to detach a root EBS volume when an EC2 instance is in a running state. In order to detach this EBS volume, you will need to stop the EC2 instance i-037ac1c6 and then detach the EBS volume from the EC2 instance. Please note, when you 'stop' an EC2 instance in VPC, the instance retains its private IP addresses when stopped and restarted. We release the public IP address and assign a new one when you restart it. However, it is important to note, any data stored in instance-store volumes are lost when an EC2 instance stops. In this case, I do not see any instance-store volumes attached in your EC2 instance i-037ac1c6.

usually mean that ssl format of a ssl cert or key file that you installed is wrong or broken. As a first step, I'd recommend you to double check file permissions and that file content does not contain any weird character.

Why don't you bypass the localized requirement and use an ELB. Install the SSL Cert on your ELB Listener and then have your ELB forward all traffic with it already secured?"

Amazon EC2	"Free tier, can I opt for a bigger server for less hours?
Can I choose a c4.4xlarge server instead of the t2.micro for less hours and still be eligible for the free tier? If so how would I calculate the hours I would get? 

The official AWS calculator doesn't even show $0.00 when I choose 750 hours t2.micro so it's very hard to get a feel for what I'm allowed.

Thank you."
Amazon EC2	"Re: Free tier, can I opt for a bigger server for less hours?
Short answer: No.

Free Tier is only eligible when selecting the specific instance types."
Amazon EC2	"Re: Free tier, can I opt for a bigger server for less hours?
Hello,
as described in our Free Tier page [1], it is only possible to use t2.micro instance type to get the benefits of it:  750 hours per month of Linux, RHEL, or SLES t2.micro instance usage, so it's not possible to use it with a ""bigger"" instance type, but less hours.

Amazon EC2	"EC2 Backups
I am new to AWS and EC2, and I am wondering how to do backups of the servers.  Currently we use VEEAM in our on premise site.  I know that you are unable to use VEEAM, however I need to understand how do you make GFS backups.  We are required to keep 7 years of data for our company.

Can somebody tell me how to go about doing this and what you use to keep long term data?

Thank you"
Amazon EC2	"Re: EC2 Backups
Hi,

For your servers its recommended that you take regular snapshots (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-creating-snapshot.html) of your EC2 instances which will backup them up to S3 (http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) a highly durable and reliable service.  For data retention I recommend you use the AWS Glacier service (https://aws.amazon.com/glacier/) which is effectively cold storage at a cost of approx $0.01 / GB.  

There are a number of backup solutions out there that integrate well with AWS.  One of them being Cloudberry and advanced technology partner (http://www.aws-partner-directory.com/PartnerDirectory/PartnerDetail?Name=CloudBerry+Lab) -  take a look here at their service -  http://www.cloudberrylab.com/amazon-glacier-bare-metal-recovery-system-state-backup.aspx

Hope this helps,

Cheers,

Stooby..."
Amazon EC2	"Re: EC2 Backups
Hi Stooby how do I move the EBS snapshot to my S3 bucket? Is there any way using the aws console? Thanks in advance!"
Amazon EC2	"Re: EC2 Backups
Hi,

The EBS Snapshots are automatically saved to the S3 environment as a part of the service, however the snapshots do not appear within your S3 account so you can't copy them to your own S3 bucket.

Cheers,

Stooby..."
Amazon EC2	"Re: EC2 Backups
Thanks for the quick reply. So that means I shall be charged (say if it's I terabyte ebs) the billing statement says:

$0.0300 per GB - first 1 TB / month of storage used

So effectively I'll be paying $30 additional for s3 storage then?"

Hi,

Yes that is correct!

Amazon EC2	"Re: EC2 Backups
If I create snapshots, how do I move the snapshots to Glacier after a week?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: EC2 Backups
I wouldn't recommend going down that route. 

If you are taking a backup of your instance it will need to remain available for you to recover if needed. There are no ""Amazon"" ways to move snapshots to Glacier. We considered it at the company I work very briefly but dismissed it. Why would you want to Glacier a snapshot you cannot guarantee you can restore? Why do the snapshot at all if that's what you're going to do with it.

You can tell an instance to snapshot and store those snapshots as long as you feel you need to. They aren't going anywhere and are not as susceptible as physical media to damage."
Amazon EC2	"Re: EC2 Backups
The reason to go to Glacier is because of the cost to keep hundreds of snapshots on S3 and the cost of it.  We need to keep 7 years of data, we use GFS backups.  I am not sure if that is the correct approach or not

How do you manage all of the snapshots?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: EC2 Backups
We do a purge every couple of months on the snapshots we have. At one point every server was backed up multiple times a week, our bill was astronomical. Now we are somewhat more intelligent in what and when we back servers up. 

The cost of server snapshots is something that comes with the requirement to be able to recover a service when it becomes necessary. 

The other thing that we have recently started is reducing the actual need for backups. Data is stored on Databases, which are backed up and data stored elsewhere if needed. Better use of our environments means we have one instance image (the GOLD) which is used to make instances via Auto-Scaling. This means we only have to update the image of the GOLD when we make a change to it. By rethinking our use of instances we have reduced our need for snapshots and have improved our ability to recover from issues. That said, we are still having to fully snapshot some of our older systems."
Amazon EC2	"Can't connect to instance after importing Centos7 VM
I am trying to import a Centos7 based VM into Amazon AWS. The VM was created with the Centos7 minimal ISO installed into VirtualBox. Networking in the VM works fine locally before trying to do the import. 

I am using the EC2 command line tools to do the import:

    ec2-import-instance /tmp/ce7-disk1.vmdk -o $AWS_ACCESS_KEY -w $AWS_SECRET_KEY -f vmdk -p Linux -b s3bucket -t m3.medium -a x86_64


The import appears to work correctly and I do see a new instance in my list of EC2 instances. After the import indicates that it has successfully completed (using ec2-describe-conversion-tasks) I try to start the instance.

The instance boots correctly and runs, but I seem to have no network connectivity at all. I have all ports forwarded to the instance and I allow all ICMP traffic, but pings and ssh do not show any response.

Hello AWS Team,

I have a requirement to do multicast between EC2 instances. From your forum i got to know that multicast is not supported on EC2. I would like to confirm my understanding on this. Could you please answer my following queries.

1. EC2-Classic instances can not support multicast. Is there any approach to get it done?

2. EC2 VPC instances does not support multicast out of the box. But can it be enabled as suggested by the following link.

Hello

If i understand correctly, your script, connection_speed.php, will connect to RDS and run a query, and return the total time (real). So the time includes the time it takes to run the query. This is not a 'fair' indication of DNS resolution. 

We would very much like you to provide an instance ID and the output

;; Received 112 bytes from 216.239.36.10#53(216.239.36.10) in 140 ms

Amazon EC2	"Re: 5 seconds delays in Route 53.
Hi there,

As per your original post to this thread, you are concerned about DNS resolution times. 

The script you used originally was connecting to a database and doing a select. This is not a fair test of DNS as the time it takes to do the select query is reflected in your test.

Your second test it timing how long it takes to curl (GET) the default page on a website (http://ya.ru). DNS will resolve the page name to the IP first. Anything that happens after that is irrelevant. You are including the time it takes to load the page in your test. So again, this is not a fair test of DNS resolution.

Your screen shot is also a test of how long it takes to load a webpage and each component on the page. The very first entry is a GET and takes 5 seconds. Again, this is the same as using 'curl' from above. It is testing how long it takes the webserver to serve the page. Not DNS resolution. 

I have checked the instance you reference - it is not in single user mode as far as the console messages show. It is actually waiting at logon.

Amazon EC2	"Cloudformation Ec2 UserData update not refreshing root EBS
HI!  I wasn't sure if this should go in the CF or EC2 forum, but I think I'm in right place.

So I have an EC2 instance in a stack on CloudFormation.  This stack gets updated when the userdata passed to the instance changes, and it shuts down, then boots up a new instance.

This machine has a root EBS device attached (I did not configure the BlockDevice parameter) so it comes default with an 8GB gp2 EBS set for ""delete on termination"" = YES.

When the userdata changes, and CF spins up a new instance, it seems like sometimes the EBS does not refresh (even though it seems it should since delete on term = yes) and I end up with the EC2 instance having a launch time of 4:30, and the EBS create time being like 3:45 (if I've done this multiple times) but it appears to not be consistent.  This also causes the new userdata to not be applied or executed properly.

I would imagine any time the EC2 instance gets shut down, and a new one comes up that the EBS should change with it, is this a bug?

Amazon EC2	"load balancer missing log
We have a load balancer with 2 web servers at the it's back. We enabled load balancer access log and put it on S3.
Because some time the web access has more than 2 to 3 seconds connection time from browser. the worst is more than 20 seconds, so we try to find out why. 
We start from look into web access log. We can find the log for the slow access on 2 back end server base on access time, and it looks not slow. 
So we look the log for same slow access from load balancer log, but the slow access couldn't find on load balancer access log which is saved on S3.
So I think there is some thing happened on load balancer server at that time.
Does someone has same experience? Is that mean AWS load balancer has problem?
We add load balancer for speed up our traffic, but it looks load balancer cause problem. 
Can AWS help us to fix this issue?

Amazon EC2	"What's the impact of EBS encryption on snapshot size?
Hello,

I'm wondering if using EBS encrypted volumes have impact on snapshot size and in consequence on costs? As far as I know snapshots are differential and compressed. Does volume encryption make the data ""less"" compressible?

Amazon EC2	"Re: What's the impact of EBS encryption on snapshot size?
Block-device encryption typically encrypts at the block level, as it is impractical to re-encrypt the entire device for every change. EBS probably already does block-level snapshots (vs byte-level) so there is likely no to little size penalty for encryption."

Amazon EC2	"Re: Is anyone else trying to tag ec2 instances automatically?
Thank you very much for your response.  I think my question wasn't well posed.  I can tag instances using the CLI successfully, once I know the username.  I work at a research laboratory where scientists are free to launch EC2 instances without tagging them.  We need to tag them so we can bill the scientists for their AWS use, and naturally I'd like to automate this process.  Strangely, however, I haven't come upon anyone else who is in the same boat.  When I posed this question to AWS tech support, their advice was to turn off instances that scientists don't tag properly.  Naturally, I'd prefer a less draconian solution.  Currently, I tag instances by processing Cloudtrails files.  I find the username of the person who launched a given instance, and tag it with their username.  My question is two-fold:  Is anyone else trying to do the same thing, and, if not, how are other people handling this situation?"

Reserved Instance Type, Platform, Instance Type, Availability Zone, and term length must be chosen at purchase, and cannot be changed later. However, you can list for sale any or all of your eligible Reserved Instances on the Reserved Instance Marketplace.

But there is a detailed section on how to modify RI: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ri-modifying.html
So these are 2 contradicting statements. Can we modify the RI once purchased or is it not allowed? OR am I missing something obvious here?

Does the RI charges apply to my existing On-demand instances?
e.g. I have 10 M4.large instances running. And I buy an RI of 10 M4.large instances.
I understand that once I buy RI, as long as there is capacity in my RI, I will be charged the RI charges and once that limit is crossed, on-demand will kick in.
However, would this RI charges of 10 M4.large instances apply to my current running 10 m4.large instances? OR, the RI charges is applicable only for the new instances that are created post RI purchase and my current running 10 m4.large instances will continue to attract on-demand changes?

This is entirely possible, however you need to change the type to a TCP under the Load Balancer Protocol when carrying out the configuration, type in the port number of 843 in the Load Balancer Port and then select the appropriate Instance Protocol and Port.

Further information and remediation steps are included in this page, I've included them below for your convenience:


1. Stop the instance
2. Create a backup (Right click the instance in the AWS Management Console, Select Image, Create Image)
3. Change the instance type to C3 (any c3)
4. Start the instance
5. RDP into the instance
6. Download the AWS PV upgrader
7. Unzip and run AWSPVDriverSetup7.2.5.msi
8. The OS will reboot automatically after running the upgrader, and install the driver. During this time the instance will be unavailable (5-15 minutes). Once complete, the instance will again be accessible.
9. Verify driver has been installed by checking device manager and under storage controllers look for AWS PV Storage Host Adapter and check the driver properties and make sure the version is 7.2.5.1
10.Stop the instance
11. Change instance type back to the original instance type
12. Start the instance, login, and use as needed

Amazon EC2	"EBS before warm-up - What can be expected?
Hi, 

We have a requirement where we need to clone an existing EBS volume (snapshot it and create a new EBS volume); and then do high IO (aprox. 10000 IOPS) on this cloned volume for a few hours and then shut it down. 

Our initial plan was to simply create this volume using Provisioned IOPS that match our requirements. The problem we are seeing on preliminary tests using General Purpose (GP) volumes is that since this is a newly created volume that hasn't been pre-warmed we are not getting even close to the theoretical IO capacity,. 

Some initial tests show that a GP volume that's sized as 1200 / 3000 IOPS will actually give us roughly 150 IOPs on the first read (from a c4.8xlarge if that matters). 

Now, we do know that ""unwarmed"" volumes have somewhat lower IO, but the numbers I've seen reported are on the range of 5%-50% drop of throughput. We are actually experiencing something that's more like 90%. 

We'd like to avoid pre-warming, since the goal here is to get the result as soon as possible. If it's possible we would rather compensate the degradation by just purchasing a higher amount of provisioned IOPs. 

So here come a couple of questions:

Is the ""150 actual IOPs on the first read of a 1200 / 3000 GP volume"" number something that can be expected or is it a sign of some problem in our configuration?
Do ""Provisioned IOPS"" volume suffer from this as much as the GP ones?
Would using a different instance types help mitigate the problem?
Would increasing the number of provisioned IOPs beyond our actual requirement help? 
Would striping the volume help?"

Hi,

AWS has a free tier in which many of its services can be used free for 1 year with limitations.  Should you exceed the limitation of the free tier then you will be charged.  To see a full explanation of what is included within the free tier please visit the page below:

https://aws.amazon.com/free/

If you shut down your instance you will not be charged, in fact quite the opposite.  When the instances are in a shutdown state, all charging stops for that instance.   If this instance is within the free tier then you wont be charged anyway (for the 1st year).

If you use a larger instance size (with more ram) then it may fall outside of the free tier limits.  The free AMI's and instance types are shown so be sure to use these when starting if you wish to keep it free.

I would recommend detaching the root volume from this instance and attaching it as a second volume to a temporary instance. 

You may find this tutorial on recovering unreachable Linux instances useful.

Once this volume is attached to an instance that you can log in I would recommend checking your network configuration (should be found at /etc/network/interfaces) and any error messages that may be of help.

Amazon EC2	"Re: remote desktop connection not working
Hi,

There are many reasons why this could be occurring.

You might not have the port for RDP (typically 3389) open in your security group
A firewall internal to the instance might not have this port open
The RDP service might not be running inside the instance
The instance might not be network reachable, due to OS troubles internal to the instance
The instance might not be network reachable, due to problems in the hardware underlying the instance (in order to enable AWS to check on this, please post an instance ID when encountering this kind of trouble--looks like: i-xxxxxxxx)

This article is really insightful regarding connecting to instances:
http://alestic.com/2009/08/ec2-connectivity

I'd start with checking your security group and post your instance ID if you're still having trouble.
Also, please describe how you are going about connecting (be as detailed as possible).

Hi,

Perhaps the following documentation will help you. If not, let me know.

To create a basic load balancer, follow these directions: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/elb-getting-started.html. 

To attach the load balancer to your Auto Scaling group: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AutoScaling/latest/DeveloperGuide/attach-load-balancer-asg.html. 

To associate your domain with your load balancer: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gettingstarted/latest/wah-linux/getting-started-configure-route53.html. Note that this step is part of a larger tutorial.

One workaround I've found for this is to use SnapshotId where the snapshot is one I went and created from a volume I had created manually that was encrypted.  One of the features of ebs volumes is that if you create a volume from a snapshot (that was created from an encrypted volume), the new volume is also encrypted (with the same encryption keys as the original volume)."

Hi,
Your instance has a very small SSD drive (8GB).
I recommend reading this blog post:

https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-ssd-backed-elastic-block-storage/

With 8GB SSD volume, your baseline of performance is 24 IOPS. If you perform more IO, then you will consume the tank of credits you have saved so far. Once exhausted, the volume performance will be 24 IOPS.
What is happening is exactly that: your volume overperforms for as long as it can, then it goes back to normal performance.
If you need more IO you can either increase the root volume size or attach an additional EBS volume and move the application here.
Keep an eye on the Cloudwatch metric for the disk queue length to spot this issue again in the future!

Hi. I'm obviously not understanding something fundamental here, but I have a domain (in Route 53) which points to my ELB. Behind that are two EC2 web servers ('mirrored'). I would like to access a URL from the EC2 instance that would in essence be a URL to itself itself e.g. 

user goes to example.com (request 1) > Route 53 > ELB > EC2#01 -> URL(example.com/getcontents) (request 2) > ...

At this point I would assume request 2 goes back out through DNS to Route 53 and the request is handled and passed back to the EC2, which then passes back the response to the original user.

Here's the use case: user clicks ""generate report"", report is created by generating a PDF output of a URL. The URL is pointing to the same site as the original one with the ""generate report"" button and so ""going out and coming back in again"".

Amazon EC2	"Re: EC2 instance is not reachable since 2 days
Hi Iyy,

I see that your instance isn't currently passing it's health checks. The underlying host is showing as healthy and I don't see any network errors between the instance and underlying host which would be causing this. As such I believe the issue is within the instance itself at the OS level.

Were any network related changes made the instance? Do you know if any firewall software was installed or enabled on the instance? Do you know if SELinux is set to enforcing? 

I had a look at your ingress security group rule applied to the instance and can see only TCP 22 is allowed. This would be the cause for traceroute timing out as it uses ICMP packets.

If you don't have another way to log into the instance then you'll need to do an offline recovery.
This means you'll need to stop the instance, detach the root volume, and attach it as a secondary device on another working instance.

When you stop a running instance, the following happens:

• The instance performs a normal shutdown and stops running (the status goes to stopping and then stopped)
• The instance retains its instance ID
• Any Amazon EBS volumes remain attached and the data persists
• Any instance store volumes don't persist
• The instance won't keep its public and private IP addresses. The exception is that instances launched in a VPC keep the same IP address when stopped and restarted.
• Any Elastic IP address mapped to the instance is unmapped. For Amazon VPC instances, the Elastic IP address remains associated with the stopped instance. When you restart the instance, the Elastic IP address is active. While the Elastic IP address is associated with the stopped instance, you're charged for the Elastic IP address.

There's also a second ELB at moderate-production-1930290273.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com which points to the same ASG as we need to terminate SSL for two different domains to the same application so this may have terminated the instances instead.

The problem is I need the code to run on a server in which I have no access to the cacerts file, so I'm trying to add the certifications programatically. I uploaded my cacerts file to the server, the program reads it as a KeyStore object, and creates an SSLSocketFactory instance:

SSLSocketFactory socketFactory = new SSLSocketFactory(keyStore, ""<password>"");
ClientConfiguration clientConfig = new ClientConfiguration();
clientConfig.getApacheHttpClientConfig().setSslSocketFactory(socketFactory);
AWSCredentials credentialsProvider = new BasicAWSCredentials(""<key>"", ""<private key>"");
AmazonEC2 ec2 = new AmazonEC2Client(credentialsProvider, clientConfig);

But it still produces the ""HTTP Status 500 - Unable to execute HTTP request: peer not authenticated"" error.
I have checked that the added certificate alias can be read successfully, with the keystore's getCertificate() method.
The ""<password>"" sent to the SSLSocketFactory constructor is the keystore's password.
Is that the correct way to add a certificate to EC2?"

Amazon EC2	"Re: Can't Connect to EC2 After Restart
Hi  jtumah,

The reason you received this error could be one or more of the following cases:

1.) Permission change on the authorized_keys file
2.) Permission change on the public key
3.) Incorrect public key
4.) Incorrect format of the public key

It would be helpful if you could provide the verbose output of the connection attempt.

I'd also think about what changes were made to the instance before the restart. A couple of follow-up questions would be:

1.) Were any changes made to users or the sshd config file?
2.) Were any network applications installed or enabled?

If you have no other means to connect to your instance then you'll need to stop the instance and detach the root volume. Then attach said root volume as a secondary device to another working instance. Once the volume is mounted you'll be able to investigate why the connections are being refused. A caveat to this is if you are using instance store storage (ephemeral storage), issuing a stop or terminate on the instance will cause any data on the instance store to be deleted.

If you are unable to stop the instance and don't have ssh access then the next course of action would be to restore from a previous backup before the instance restart occurred.

Additionally, the following article may prove helpful - Example of Linux Instance Recovery

For all I know, the last line above indicates a problem. Instance passes checks, is marked as active but can never be connected through remote desktop.

Security group allows RDP connections. It's not the first time I encounter such a problem with avrious Windows types.

How am I supposed to handle that? Destroying and re-creating the instance doesn't help.

I can't use Windows-powered instacnes due to unknown reasons, and none of AWS supprot staff does care?

What happened in the procedure of creating Windows instances that it doesn't work any more? Are there additional undocumented steps to take?

Amazon EC2	"Re: Windows 2008 R2 Base 64-bit server AWS instance doesn't start
Reason was:

EC2-VPC Verify that the route table for the subnet has a route that sends all traffic destined outside the VPC (0.0.0.0/0) to the Internet gateway for the VPC. For more information, see Creating a Custom Route Table (Internet Gateways) in the Amazon VPC User Guide.

Amazon EC2	"Re: Can't connect to Windows 2012 (Small instance)
Hello Rodney,

The problem was, as I see it, that in VPC settings for new instance there was no internal route to private networks from external.

This step IS mandatory for new VPC-based instances, but in this manual

http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/EC2Win_GetStarted.html

it is NOT even mentioned. By default, routing is not including access from beyond private networks and that gives strange results like refused access to instance without any clues in Console.

My recommendation is to include that notice into ""Getting started..."" part. The only place when this is mentioned is

http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/troubleshooting-windows-instances.html

citing: ""EC2-VPC Verify that the route table for the subnet has a route that sends all traffic destined outside the VPC (0.0.0.0/0) to the Internet gateway for the VPC. For more information, see Creating a Custom Route Table (Internet Gateways) in the Amazon VPC User Guide."""

Amazon EC2	"problem connecting to aws services. ec2 instance was working before
im having two issues at the moment, first i recently created an sql server and i am not able to connect to it at all remotely, my request keep getting denied. i configured the security groups every which way from all traffic inbound and outbound to specifically just my ip no luck. i am attempting to connect through mysql workbench. if you can maybe forward me a tutorial or something that lets me know what im doing wrong and what are the proper steps because i tried everything out there 

secondly i originally set up a connection to my ec2 instance on my lap top through netbeans. everything worked perfectly and i was able to upload my files. so i decided to duplicate the setup on my computer as well. same pem and pkk keys. and it shows that the connection is good and when i upload files , its shows them uploaded. but they are not uploading. when i access the files i created. for example a new web page, or a modification of an old one. the new one does not show up and its says that the page does not exist, when i upload the old on and synchronize,  when i go to the source on the page that pulls up, its the old code and not the new one even though the synchronize tool is telling me that the new code got uploaded

UPDATE: i deleted the first instance and made a brand new one, different pem and pkk keys, same problem when i upload a file, it says successfully uploaded , but when i pulls it up , it says file does not exist. i also used file zilla to manually upload files. but when i run the url same thing.

also im not sure how relavent it is but on my laptop i dont have xampp installed, and on my computer i do and i have it set to run on local host, can that be interfering with it trying to pull up pages from a remote server. for a while i changed the lan setting in google chrome to prefer local connection over remote. i unchecked that later but same problem?

i can still upload files on my laptop though, that is when i had the old instance, havent tried the new one

Elastic IP is exactly what you need. Elastic IP is a public IP which is assigned to your account. You can remap it to other instances, configure reverse DNS and the Elastic IP does not change unless you release the Elastic IP address and allocate a new one.

However, there are charges when assigning Elastic IP to a stopped instance or assigning additional Elastic IP to an instance or not assigning Elastic IP to any instances.

Yes, you can get a better rate if you buy a reservation. As this is kind of a commitment, you should more or less know that this is the instance type you will be needing during the 1 or 3 year term.

Amazon EC2	"Re: Elastic IP Doesnot Resolve
Your DNS configuration looks fine. However, there is no response from your server. Each EC2 instance is associated with at least one security group, which basically acts as a firewall. Everything is blocked by default, and you will need to add rules to open up for certain traffic. If you browse to the EC2 section of the Management Console, you'll find ""Security Groups"" (under ""Network & Security"") in the menu on the left hand side. Select the security group used by this instance and switch to the ""Inbound"" tab. If you don't see an entry for HTTP (port 80), simply add a new rule by selecting HTTP from the dropdown list. Hit ""Add Rule"", followed by ""Apply Rule Changes""."

Reserved Instances that are Heavy Utilization, All Upfront, Partial Upfront or No Upfront will show the entire month's total of hours and charges in the Billing Console starting at the beginning of the month. However, these RI line items will not increase during the month.

Hello,

It looks like instances of that AMI are being managed by the ""Clip Generator Scaling Group"" Auto Scaling Group.  Looking over the recent events, the instance may have started failing ELB health checks, at which point the Auto Scaling Group terminated the instance in order to replace it.

As a best practice, instances being managed by Auto Scaling should not be seeing active code development because, as you have experienced, any instance could be terminated based on the scaling decisions of the Group.  It would be best to move any code development to a separate development environment that is not being managed by Auto Scaling to prevent this from happening again in the future.

Amazon EC2	"Re: EC2 windows machine start up time is more than 5 minutes and 30 seconds
Hi,

What is the size/type of your instance? you could perhaps increase the instance to a better spec giving you more Compute power for a quicker boot.

You could also look at reducing the threshold on your Autoscaling Group as to when it starts a new instance just slightly so the instance starts sooner giving you that extra time for it to boot preventing you having issues on demand when you need it.

Amazon EC2	"Re: EC2 windows machine start up time is more than 5 minutes and 30 seconds
Let me explain the problem to you -

Consider two scenarios here :

1) an EC2 instance is started from stopped state and
2) another EC2 instance is created from AMI image

In scenario 1, remote desktop (3389) and http (80) access is available in about 1.5-2 mins while in scenario 2, the same takes around 5-6 mins.

And since auto-scaling always creates new instances on every scale up event it takes 6 mins for us to actually start using the new machine for performing the extra work.

The time AWS takes to create a new instance from AMI image is too large for practical usage.  Please guide us to reduce this time as much as possible."

Yes, we tried changing the instance type to the highest specs EC2 instance (i.e. 36 core compute optimized), still the time to start the machine completely is 5 mins, it just reduced by 30 secs.

Reducing threshold is a workaround for this problem which we can definitely implement at any point of time.

Now since, it is getting clear that AWS EC2 windows instances require around 5 mins for creation, we will consider reducing threshold values for our AutoScaling group.

I have the same issue.

It's connecting fine from another brand new instance I just created within the same subnet.

Also, blocked 1701 port I used.

Also, this thing happened from nowhere. I configured VPN and for some moment instance became inaccessible.

Amazon EC2	"Re: Stuck because I can't connect to my server on SSH (port 22).
Hello Mkonda,

I did check your instance i-a5a121d8 and was able to connect to TCP port 22 & 80 using netcat.
However, connect requests to TCP ports 3000 and 443 was refused by your instance which indicates that there are no services running on your instance listening on those TCP ports.
You can verify this by running the following command in your instance:
$ sudo netstat -tlpn

Following are the results of the netcat tests which I ran against your instance:
$ nc -zv xx.xx.xx.xx 3000
nc: connect to xx.xx.xx.xx port 3000 (tcp) failed: Connection refused
$ nc -zv xx.xx.xx.xx 443
nc: connect to xx.xx.xx.xx port 443 (tcp) failed: Connection refused
$ nc -zv xx.xx.xx.xx 80
Connection to xx.xx.xx.xx 80 port [tcp/http] succeeded!
$ nc -zv xx.xx.xx.xx 22
Connection to xx.xx.xx.xx 22 port [tcp/ssh] succeeded!

Since TCP connection on port 22 is succeeding, you should be able to SSH/SCP to your instance. If you are still facing issues, can you ssh to your instance with -v option and share the output? You can run the  following command to ssh to your instance:
$ ssh ec2-user@xx.xx.xx.xx -i /path/to/PrivateKey.pem

Note: Replace xx.xx.xx.xx with the public IP of your instance
Regards
Shiroy"

The instance type included in the free tier offers burstable performance (see Amazon EC2 Instances). However, it is not artificially limited in any way. You get the same thing on the free tier as you would if you paid for it.

is it possible to upgrade to different type then go back to free tier? 

Yes, you can use anything that AWS has to offer and ""go back"" to the free stuff at any time. You will simply be charged for anything that isn't covered by the free tier. You don't lose any benefits by evaluating other options on the platform."

Amazon EC2	"Re: If amazon made some constraints for ec2?
Hi  v_francis,

I had a look at the instance and can it and the underlying host are passing all health checks. I don't see any network errors which may have prevented or interrupted your program connection.

I see your security group rules for the instance are adequate for your current use case. With that said you should look to lock down the administrative ports to a single IP or at a minimum a specific range of IPs.

The free tier program is simply a billing adjustment. The resources utilized under the free tier program operate under the same performance as hourly on-demand resources.

I'd suggest taking a look at your application/system logs to try to determine why the connection failed and/or was interrupted.

When the connection crashes are you still logged in via ssh? If your ssh connection was not interrupted during the event then you should be able to rule out site-to-site network issues.

Amazon EC2	"Re: No pem key to Windows instance and need to access the server
My apologies. You are correct, you still need the original .pem file to decrypt the new password. This is the solution for a different scenario.

Looking at the documentation for the EC2Config service, it sounds like you can set your own password (in clear text) for sysprep. Note that I haven't tried this yet, so I don't have the step-by-step directions, but I'll work on this and add it to the documentation.

Amazon EC2	"Re: No pem key to Windows instance and need to access the server
I was able to figure out how to recover my Windows instance, here were my steps:

1.	Stop the Windows instance that you do not have the key file for.
2.	Right click and create an image from the stopped instance.
3.	Go to the ami you just created and launch an instance from it, create a new Key Pair for the instance, shut down the instance once it's finished verification (you cannot log into it yet).
4.	Create a new windows instance (call it Recovery or something meaningful) in the same availability zone, use the newly created Key Pair for it.
5.	Once it's running use the new Key Pair to get the temp Windows admin pw.
6.	From the Left menu, go into EBS Volumes, select the volume of the instance created from the AMI in Step 3 and dismount the volume. Mount the volume to the new Recovery instance (you can use the default mount point that is already in the field).
7.	Once mounted RDP to the recovery server and follow the directions for Step# 7 on editing the config.xml file: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ec2-windows-passwords.html?console_help=true#ResettingAdminPassword
8.	Shut down the Recovery server, dismount the volume and mount it back to your instance from Step 3. I had to specify the mount point as /dev/sda1 because the server did not boot if I didn't (all my Windows instances have /dev/sda1 as the root device).
9.	Start up the instance from Step 3, right click on it and select 'Get Windows password'. Use the new .pem file to get the temporary password.
10.	RDP to your newly recovered Windows instance.

We are making some HTTP requests from our EC2 server to our vendor's EC2 server.  Our server is Instance ID i-9eb375d1(ip address: 54.246.186.165).  Their IP address is 54.171.95.50.  The odd behavior is that we can make HTTP requests from 54.246.186.165 to their server and if it results in a HTTP response code of 404 it all works fine.  If the result is going to be ""larger"", the HTTP request is made, they see the request in their logs, but we never see a single byte of the HTTP response.  This was tested using curl.  If I test it from another machine in our VPC, it works fine.  

Just to avoid a red herring, we can also make a request for a very small resource and we get a HTTP 200 response and the full body as expected.  So it isn't just the response code, the claim seems to be the size of the response is what triggers the behavior.

Are you aware of anything in the EC2 network configuration that might cause this type of behavior?

Thanks for any insight you might have.

Here is the message from the vendor:

""We’ve double checked our rules in our firewall and there are not any entries that would block the IP 54.246.186.165 from accessing our server. 

We’ve checked our error and access logs and the only items we can see from this ip address are the 404 foo failures, so it looks like the header responses can be obtained by your server but when any large data packets are requested this is when it fails so we believe its failing on amazons network and not the amazon server itself. 

We have come across this before when we have been load testing amazon servers using the ab command from our non amazon servers to amazon servers, they get blocked when the IP is causing suspicious activity (i.e. their software accessing multiple different sites in quick succession on port 80). 

Please can you get your engineers to contact Amazon support and ask them why their ip 54.246.186.165 cannot access the EC2 server: 54.171.95.50, we have tested the same curl command on multiple non amazon servers and it works fine so it must be something on their network blocking your server."""

You are using a version of the Amazon Linux AMI that is about 4 years old and that was a very early beta AMI.

Upgrading from that old of a version to the current packages is not supported.

I recommend that you move to the latest version of the Amazon Linux AMI as soon as possible, if that is an option for you.

We released the 2014.09 Amazon Linux AMI on Tuesday (2 days ago) and if you launch a new instance of that, it will automatically update bash to the fixed version that is in our repos.

Amazon EC2	"Re: Shellshock Exploit and Instance Reboots
What about earlier versions of the containers?  We are running 64bit Amazon Linux 2013.09 v1.0.1  Doing a forced upgrade now to the latest container is a bit problematic for us."
Amazon EC2	"Re: Shellshock Exploit and Instance Reboots
I'm confused by the directions given in this thread.
What is this yum you speak off?

My EC2 instance runs Ubuntu.
And I do not have a /etc/image-id file.

My EC2 t1.micro instance has the vulnerability, and apt-get update, apt-get dist-upgade will not pull in a new bash.

How can I fix an EC2 host that is running Ubuntu 13.10 ?

Thanks,

OP Here. For 2013.09 none of the suggested fixes either in this thread or the previous response's link to the other thread are working. I've copied the shell results here, but basic flow I followed: 
1. Follow instructions from https://alas.aws.amazon.com/ALAS-2014-419.html, which is sudo yum clean all && sudo yum update bash
2. Run patch from sudo yum install -y http://packages.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/2013.09/updates/556c442ced2f/x86_64/Packages/bash-4.1.2-15.18.20.amzn1.x86_64.rpm Biggest concern here is, why am I installing a package that points to bash 4.1.2? Shellshock affects all bash version through 4.3 at the very least
3. Reboot EC2 Instance then load shell again No change
4. Stop EC2 Instance Since I'm on ElasticBeanstalk, a new EC2 instance was started automatically, again with Bash v4.1.2 loaded
5. Ran cat /etc/image-id && cat /etc/yum.conf For your review
6. Ran ""updated"" patch sudo yum install -y http://packages.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/2013.09/updates/cad3d01bf38e/x86_64/Packages/bash-4.1.2-15.18.22.amzn1.x86_64.rpm No change

This is the default, if you make this bigger yum won't see if the metadata

download the new metadata and ""pay"" for it by yum not having correct
information.
It is esp. important, to have correct metadata, for distributions like
Fedora which don't keep old packages around. If you don't like this checking
interupting your command line usage, it's much better to have something
manually check the metadata once an hour (yum-updatesd will do this).

Amazon EC2	"Re: Shellshock Exploit and Instance Reboots
Amazon, 

In case you'd seen my earlier message, I am editing it now because this is now fixed. I think what would help users is specifying the fact that Even though this affects version of Bash through v4.2, and v4.3 is out, you've actually included the CVEs patched for version 4.1.2. This was the biggest source of confusion.

I'm attempting to increase the size of the boot drive on my EC2 instance, so I followed the directions listed here...http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ebs-expand-volume.html. I went through all the steps: stopped the instance, created a snapshot, created a new volume from the snapshot, detach the old volume, attach the new volume with device name /dev/sda1. When I start the instance with the new volume, the console tells me the instance is running, but it fails the status checks and I can't connect to it. Detaching the new volume and reattaching the old one with device name /dev/sda1 makes it work again.

Amazon EC2	"Re: Connection Timeout for outbound HTTP
Hello,

Thank you for the post.

I took a look at your instance: i-478f32ae and found that you have restrictions on the inbound rules. In order to allow inbound return traffic from requests originating in the subnet, you will need to add an inbound rule for ephemeral port range in the network ACL. We use the ephemeral port range 49152-65535.

You can find more information about 'Recommended Network ACL Rules for Your VPC', please refer to this documentation: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Appendix_NACLs.html

Also, more information about 'Ephemeral Ports' can be found on this link: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_ACLs.html#VPC_ACLs_Ephemeral_Ports

I hope the above information helps.

Thank you,
Nikhil"

Amazon EC2	"Lost connectivity to AWS Instance.
We recently lost RDP connectivity to one of our clients EC2 Windows 2008R2 instances. It seemed impossible to connect, so I made the decision to reboot the instance without investigating any further. 

Unfortunately the machine would not even shut down and remained in the 'stopping' state for a number of hours. We had snapshots of the machine, so we had to resort to creating a new instance from a snapshot and then reconfigure DNS at the clients end so that they could reconnect to the server.

I did manage to stop the original instance in the end, but only by terminating, so I wasn't able to do any sort of post mortem.

Does anyone have any suggestions as to why we lost connectivity to the instance and why we couldn't stop and restart it? Also are there any ways anyone can suggest to try and diagnose and resolve such an issue without resorting to a reboot?

ELB with session stickiness will send the same session to the same instance that is registered in the ELB. In your case that instance is running apache.

There are various techniques for setting up session stickiness between apache and Tomcat, which mostly depend on the version of Tomcat and the connector you're using. Google for ""tomcat session stickiness"" and you'll find more about this."

Amazon EC2	"Joining VPCs Together
Greetings All,

We where advised when we started, to use separate accounts for each one of our customers (which works well for billing purposes and security). Right or wrong - this is where we are now and don't have  the ability to u-turn.

What we are trying to achieve is a central hub (hub spoke setup) using one account / VPC as the central hub. Central hub contains master servers - need to transfer data to them

We also utilise the model where we have ""back"" servers with no public IP and a NAT gateway as their outbound.

We can't use VPC peering (not possible across region), can't use the AWS VPN (AWS VPN to AWS VPN not possible) - so it's build your own.

There seems to be three ways to make a redundant NAT Gateway & VPN instance


Self monitoring hosts - we are getting split brain
Single instance autoscaling group - sort of works but autoscaling only monitors the state of the machine, not running services and was not particularly reliable
Using BGP and VyOS  https://seshupasam.wordpress.com/tag/aws-ec2-vpc-vpn-vyos/


I am finding information from 2011-2014 in google searches, but nobody seems to have come up with a new approach and none of them are really scalable or easy to manage.

So:-

1) Do any insiders know if there is a fix to this problem on the AWS roadmaps anywhere. VPC peering, cross region, would solve the whole thing
2) Any inspired ideas - any other approaches...? I have a vague thought about using small VPCs in the central account, but there is a limit to the number of VPCs - so that kills that

Number of spokes is around 14 at the moment - growing at the rate of one every couple of months.

Many thanks for you time and consideration

Amazon EC2	"EC2 Autoscaling Instances sometimes can't access ElastiCache nodes
Hi,

Sometimes EC2 instances are launched into my autoscaling group that can't access Redis running on ElastiCache. The majority of the EC2 instances launched have no problem accessing ElastiCache but occasionally an instance will be launched that is unable to connect to Redis. The instance just has the connection timeout to Redis and the only solution is for the instance to be terminated and re-launched. On one of the affected instances I attempted to also telnet to the Redis instance but I just got:

telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection timed out

Why is this happening? I've configured my autoscaling group to use ELB health checks so the instance is terminated (ELB health check fails if instance can't connect to Redis amongst other things) but I'd like to figure out why this is happening in the first place.

Example instance id:  i-c8df8e2d (was terminated due to ELB health check, logs show it was unable to connect to Redis)

Any ideas? Just had some more instances launch that were unable to access Redis."
Amazon EC2	"Re: EC2 Autoscaling Instances sometimes can't access ElastiCache nodes
Hi,

I was interested to see your forum posting, as we are experiencing the exact same intermittent symptoms; autoscaled servers with correctly configured Security Groups simply cannot connect to a single ElastiCache Redis node. 

The problem seems more prevalent when the launched instance is in the same AZ as the Redis node, but this does not guarantee failure as sometimes they do work properly. I have a support case open already with AWS, and have received some suggestions relating to stale ARP cache entries, but the proposed solutions haven't fixed the issue for me. I still have one server that I have kept back for investigation which steadfastly refuses to connect. There is nothing coming back, not even an ACK, from the Redis node when I try and connect.

You may have some luck with the answer I was given:
""The problem appears to be due to incorrect ARP caching by the Linux kernel. The problem can be seen in Ubuntu 14.04 as my colleague pointed out but it also exists in Amazon Linux with kernel version > 3.10.

The newer version of the Linux kernel caches ARP entries more aggressively which can lead to this behavior if the same private IP is reused for multiple instances since they have different MAC addresses on the network interface.

To disable the new caching behavior, use the following sysctl: sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh1=0
Alternatively you may want to use a separate VPC subnets.""

I don't know if this will help in your case. I am still waiting for AWS to investigate our issue further and if I get any more suggestions from them I can post them up here too.

I'll watch this thread with interest now...

Thanks for the reply, glad to know I'm not the only one experiencing this problem.

The reply from AWS seems odd, if the instance has just been created from an AMI how could the ARP cache entry for the Redis node already be stale?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: EC2 Autoscaling Instances sometimes can't access ElastiCache nodes
To further investigate possible ARP issues I attached a second ENI and EIP to the instance that was having problems connecting, and ""flipped"" it over to use that interface instead. I was then able to connect to the ElastiCache node using this new private IP address.

Overnight the AWS support guys flushed the ARP cache on the ElastiCache node, and since that time I am able to connect using the original interface again. So the root cause appears to be stale ARP entries on the ElastiCache node rather than the EC2 clients trying to connect.

I am waiting to hear what the permanent fix might be from AWS. I imagine they might have to make similar adjustments to the ElastiCache ARP settings. I'll let you know what I hear back..."

Hi,

Thank you for the post. 

We are sorry for the inconvenience experienced. 

We are investigating the issue. We have opened a outbound case to your account to gather more details. You should be able to access the case from the Support center in the AWS management console.

Amazon EC2	"Re: EC2 Autoscaling Instances sometimes can't access ElastiCache nodes
We had a similar issue and it was resolved and this was the reply from Support.

The fix is to disable the aggressive caching on newer Linux kernels on your Elasticache nodes which can lead to this behavior if the same private IP is reused for multiple instances since they have different MAC addresses on the network interfaces.

I have seen this with instances that are constantly launched and terminated by auto scaling in the same subnet which leads to re-use of the IP's

You can also use a different VPC subnet in the same AZ to workaround this but for now with the arp caching you should be ok going forward."

Amazon EC2	"EC2 On Demand Instance Request Best Practices
We recently requested an instance capacity increase in the us-west-2 region, which was granted yesterday - CASE ID: 1455189741.  

The next working day we observed that the limit increase was reflected in our console.

However, when trying to request 6 d2.8xlarge instances, we are consistently getting the following error.

Service.InsufficientInstanceCapacity: Insufficient capacity. 
( 
  Service: AmazonEC2;

  Error Code: InsufficientInstanceCapacity;

So my question is as follows:
     a) Is there any way for me to know if the error results from a limitation on my account or a lack of capacity in the AWS region?
     b) What is the suggested method for working around this behavior?  Should I write a script that periodically resubmits my request until it is granted, or can I submit the request in a way that adds the request to a queue that I then can wait on until the request is granted?  Later when we are finished with R&D we will invest in reserved instances, but at this point I want to know the best way work with On-Demand requests."
Amazon EC2	"Re: EC2 On Demand Instance Request Best Practices
Hello,

Thank you for the post.

Looking at the error you are receiving: 'InsufficientInstanceCapacity', this error means that AWS does not currently have enough available capacity to service your request. 

In order to work around this, you an try the followings:

Wait a few minutes and then submit your request again; capacity can shift frequently.
Submit a new request with a reduced number of instances. For example, if you're making a single request to launch 15 instances, try making 3 requests for 5 instances, or 15 requests for 1 instance instead.
Submit a new request without specifying an Availability Zone.
Submit a new request using a different instance type (which you can resize at a later stage).


When you try to launch an instance and you have reached your concurrent running instance limit, then you will receive an error: 'InstanceLimitExceeded'. In this case, you will need to submit the 'Request to Increase Amazon EC2 Instance Limit' form to increase the limit for EC2 instances.

For more information about 'Troubleshooting Instance Capacity', please refer to this documentation: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-capacity.html

I hope the above information helps.

Amazon EC2	"can someone help a newbie with ebs volumes and spot instances?
So here is what I have going, and I can't figure out how to make it do what I want to do:

I have a regular(on demand, I think?) instance that I created from someone else's Ubuntu instance.  I was planning on going with the g2.2xlarge for cost purposes.  It had a ebs volume as the root volume, which I though would retain persistence of data for the spot instances I would create from the image.  I went on to install the software I wanted and config it to spawn the software in the command line in a tmux window at boot.

Once the spot instances are up I modify the config files on both and they are running, writing progress to a file in the same directory on their assigned ebs volumes.  Everything is good until Amazon shuts the spot instances down due to price too low or over capacity or something.  When they come back up all progress is lost and they lose all changes and have new volumes assigned to them.  This goes against my (limited) understanding of ebs volumes.

I've read something about attaching an additional ebs volume, but I am not sure how to reference it in a hard coded startup script for the tmux command.

So, basically, I need a persistent directory I can store my software and it's two config and progress files, and have that referenced in a startup script.  I need to be able to modify it in a running spot instance and then reboot.

Amazon EC2	"Outbound SMTP being blocked (was previously allowed)
Hi,

I have 2 Elastic IPs which Amazon granted permission to send outgoing mail (through here: https://aws.amazon.com/forms/ec2-email-limit-rdns-request).  Yesterday, we had to reassign the EIP to another instance / ENI for the first time.  After this we can no longer connect to external SMTP servers on port 25 to deliver mail from the new instance.

I'm having the same issue. I've opened an urgent support ticket under my support contract and I'd encourage everyone to do the same. This is just basic blocking and tackling, and we're paying a premium for the EC2 time for SLES precisely so this kind of ""software maintenance"" is taken care of. 

It's ridiculous. Completely preventable problem that you expect when you're not paying for it, but this isn't free software, and this isn't a 2nd tier provider.

Renew your SSL certs SuSE/AWS, not hard. 

In the mean time, considering alias'ing out curl with the right ""ignore CA issues"" command line options so when it's called this issue goes away (not a huge fan of defeating security mechanisms, but for this short window to work around this, it's worth it). First searching docs for a flag that will disable it directly in zypper/yast - anyone have any other ideas?

EDIT: Tried aliasing out curl with curl -k and curl --insecure and didn't do anything, I figure this is an invocation that avoids the shell or is a call to libcurl avoiding the actual curl command altogether...didn't think it'd work but was worth a try...

EDIT II:

Looking at the source code of zypper it appears that perhaps appending ""?ssl_verify=no"" to the end of all repo URLs might be a temporary workaround to avoid ssl cert issues. Will try this and report back. 

EDIT III:

Initial attempts at using ?ssl_verify=no do not work. Replaced all repos in /etc/zypp/repos.d using find . -type f | xargs sed -i 's/11-x86_64/11-x86_64?ssl_verify=no/g' and verified that the ssl_verify=no portions were there in the files and in the failure message it also occurs, think it's becuase there is some kind of redirect from these urls to a secure URL (they are http URLs, so there MUST be some kind of redirect/URL rewrite going on to get an SSL error on a regular http url...). Ideas? Maybe try changing everything to https to avoid this redirect/rewrite? 

AWS support has been more than useless on this, on an urgent ticket they haven't even responded 4 hours later (1 hour SLA).

EDIT IV:

Changing things to https results in: 

Retrieving repository 'SLE11-SDK-SP3-Pool' metadata [/]
Permission to access 'https://default-ec2-update.susecloud.net/repo/update/SLE11-SDK-SP3-Pool/sle-11-x86_64/repodata/repomd.xml?ssl_verify=no' denied.

Hmmm...interesting. Anyone have any details on why http:// works/is allowed and https fails/403s directly? How/why is http getting ssl'ed that causes the initial error. Since AWS is useless on this topic, I'd like to get a workaround because who knows if they'll actually fix it/figure it out in good time - they can't even respond to a ticket in their SLA on this....

Amazon EC2	"Re: EC2 repositories problems with SLES 11p3
Davin,

Thanks for the conciliatory words. I know you, personally, are not at fault, and, really, neither is any AWS employee because SuSE dropped a ball here. 

But, it is pretty worrisome to me that as AWS' partner in providing the value-added service for which we are ostensibly paying, Amazon either lacks the leverage to effect any meaningful fix in a meaningful timeframe (we all know this takes 5 minutes to fix, technically, so we've now had something like 72 hours of bureaucracy around getting that done, and it's still not done? Wow.) or simply doesn't care. Someone at SuSE just needs to buy a new cert from the CA and install it. Really, I could have driven to Provo and done this myself and driven back home in less time - what gives? 

I'm not really interested in patronizing words saying AWS is sorry, because that, actually, despite sounding nice and conciliatory, doesn't actually fix any problems (clearly!), is actually a bit on the patronizing side, and ignores the fact that there is a broader CONFIDENCE issue at play here - that if AWS can't both respond to this small an issue in a timely manner (both in forums and in urgent tickets with 1 hour SLAs that were absolutely destroyed by almost an order of magnitude), let alone actually effect a fix to a VERY easy problem to solve that should ACTUALLY NEVER HAVE OCCURRED IN THE FIRST PLACE (e.g. yes SuSE should be on this, but it should ALSO be on AWS' checklist/calendar to manage these things so this does not happen, because, ultimately, AWS says they are supporting this image and we're paying for that - so, ultimately, passing the hot potato to SuSE actually doesn't work). 

So, yes, we all know AWS is very sorry. But, really, be straight with us: WHY?

1) Why did this happen? As I elucidated above, two balls got dropped (at the very least) - WHY? What's changing to make sure this does not happen again? 

2) Why was AWS stupidly silent for so long on this? Again, what's going to be different next time other than ""trust us""? 

3) Why is a 5 minute fix taking 3 days and counting? Again, what's changing? AWS surely has the leverage to tell SuSE shape-up-or-ship-out, right?"

It depends on how your application works, but you could rely on sticky sessions using Elastic Load Balancer or your own load balancer to ensure that client requests are routed to the same frontend.

Amazon EC2	"Re: How to price a reservation instance with no upfront fee?
Hello, 

If you purchase a No Upfront Reserved Instance and then wish to sell it, you can do so via the Reserved Instance Marketplace. What you'd need to do is list the No Upfront Reserved Instance as $0.00 and if it's sold, the buyer it takes over the hourly payments for the remaining duration of the reservation. While the Reserved Instance is listed on the Marketplace it still belongs to you, and you can still use it. When selling a No Upfront Reserved Instance for $0.00, Amazon will not charge a transaction fee for its purchase. 

If you haven't sold Reserved Instances before, it's a good idea to read http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ri-market-selling-guide.html, as it covers all the steps you need to follow.

Amazon EC2	"Re: How to prevent linux configs modifications during EC2 instance cloning?
Hello Vitaly,

When you launch a new instance from one of the latest Amazon AMIs and enable password authentication for ec2-user or other users, and then you create an image from it you might no longer be able to log in to your server using password authentication method.  Your sshd_config file will be overwritten and the PasswordAuthentication line will be reverted back to PasswordAuthentication no. In order to prevent this from happening you need to modify the ""defaults.cfg"" file  on the original instance before you create an AMI from it:

There is a file that needs to be edited:

file name: defaults.cfg
path: /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/defaults.cfg


 Change the following lines:
lock_passwd: true to  lock_passwd: false
ssh_pwauth:   false to ssh_pwauth:   true

Save the defaults.cfg file

Create an image from that ec2 instance. Now, once you launch an instance from it you should be able to connect using your custom password.

if the load overuses available memory, the OS can get horribly slow as it thrashes everything in and out of swap space.  it can take minutes to work a connection and you probably conclude it is unavailable before then.  a reboot is often faster than waiting 4 minutes to get in and 3 more minutes to check on it.  maybe a temporary larger instance can help you figure out the overload.

Hello,

The memory exhaustion (Out Of Memory) problem stems from the fact that there are services/applications running within your instance that are consuming more memory than the memory that is present on your instance type.

You can resolve the issue by changing your instance type to a larger instance offering more memory.

Amazon EC2	"EC2 to EBS  is the duo good enough or is there a better approach?
I am contracted to design a web portal that will allow my customer (amazon user) the ability to move data akin to client side encryption to EC2. The constraints are as follows: 1. It has to has to be cost effective GB/Month. 2. S3 is not a solution since it cost more but seem faster.  2. Must be accessed from anywhere in the world like S3. 

What they want to accomplish:

1. Move and store encrypted data within amazon region that is the most cost effective and fast for EBS--US East is preferred in this case.
2. All backup or snapshots will be sent to a different region of EBS bucket instead of S3 like say US West. Just the redundancy needed for BCP and DRP.
3. They want manage their master keys for encryption.

What I think:

I think the solution is more like cost effective in all. I am not sure if S3 could be a better idea in this case. 

My assumptions:
I think that amazon will charge for encrypted data volume since that will increase the file size especially using AES which involved IV for very large files. This company is moving large files on a regularly.

If my assumption is wrong how will amazon deal with server-side encryption where I have 10GB of data to encrypt and after the encryption I now have 14GB. Will I only pay for the 10 GB? In this case can you see that client-side encryption could win the data depending on how they will deal with both. 

Conclusion:
What do you guys think about this approach? Let me know if there is something missing. Why is EBS a good choice here? Why not S3? 

Thanks.

Hello,

Thanks for posting. I've tested your code from my instance and I have no issues connecting. Do you have issues connecting to any other port on this instance from this end point? You can use Netcat to listen on another port and use cURL or Netcat on the other end to send a request to that port. Be sure the port is allowed in your Security Groups. The basic syntax is as follows:

server:
nc -l PORT
 
client:
curl SERVER-IP-HERE:PORT
nc SERVER-IP-HERE PORT


Here is how it looks when I test on my instance:

server:
nc -l 5201
 
client:
curl MY-IP:5201
or 
nc MY-IP 5201


In the above example when curl connects you should see the GET request on the server or if you test with netcat anything you type in should be displayed on the server terminal if you are able to establish a connection.

Is there a local firewall running on this instance that could be blocking this connection? Verify by using the following:

sudo iptables -nvL

Brandon"
Amazon EC2	"subnets and sec groups with ec2-run-instances and ec2-request-spot-instance
I'm building automation around ec2-request-spot-instances and ec2-run-instances in the java ec2-tools. I'm using 1.7.5.0 2015-04-15, which is the latest at the time of this writing.

When I'm using ec2-run-instances to create an instance in a vpc subnet, it throws an error complaining about using sec group names because for reasons I don't understand, sec groups have to be defined by ID rather than name when the instance is in a vpc subnet. OK, switched to using IDs, and now all is well in that world.

However, if I try to create a spot instance request using the same group syntax and ID's when using ec2-request-spot-instances (as the documention would suggest I should do since it matches the docs for ec2-run-instances) it errors out with the same error I was getting before.

This suggests to me that the ec2-request-spot-instances command is doing something different internally. Not sure if this would be a functional bug or a documentation bug, but it seems like it must be one or the other. In the meantime, is changing my security-group selections via the --network-attachment option a viable workaround? It seems that using that forces a lot of things to be manually decided that I'm currently getting automagically, so I'm reluctant to spend time restructuring and adding logic to make those decisions if it's ultimately not going to work either.

Amazon EC2	"Re: subnets and sec groups with ec2-run-instances and ec2-request-spot-instance
Hi,

I have confirmed that you can't specify both a subnet and a security group in the launch specification for a Spot Instance. You can specify a subnet and security group using a network attachment in the launch specification:

ec2-request-spot-instances ami-xxxxxxxx -p 0.05 --key my-key-pair -a "":0:subnet-xxxxxxxx:::sg-xxxxxxxx"" 

I will update the documentation.

The 91.227.208.117 can ping the instance. The instance cannot ping 91.227.208.117 (this is maybe due to a firewall). The problem is that 91.227.208.117 can telnet port 80 of the instance, but not port 25 of the instance. So the problem is about incoming connections on port 25."
Amazon EC2	"Re: Cannot receive income connections from 91.227.208.117
Hello,

I apologize for the issues you've encountered. I am also able to ping this IP address from my instance as well as other servers not located within AWS' network. It is interesting to know that a successful connection can be made from 91.227.208.117 on port 80 but not on port 25. As this confirms that a connection can be established to the instance. I reviewed the instance and the Security Groups and they are defined correctly. There are no Network ACLs or Egress rules that would be blocking this connection. For the sake of being complete have you verified there is nothing running locally on the instance that would be blocking connections to this IP, iptables for example?

I tested my ability to connect to port 25 on your instance and found that I am able to establish a connect.

nc -vz X.X.X.X8 25
Connection to X.X.X.X8 25 port [tcp/smtp] succeeded!


Since this host is not under your control it will make troubleshooting difficult unless you can work with them to run some further testing. If you can coordinate with them I would perform a packet capture on the instance while they attempt to connect to port 25 and port 80, it would also be helpful if they could also do a packet capture during the same time. By having a packet capture from both ends we'll have a much better idea of what is going on at the network level on both sides.

If there are no packets arriving at your instance on port 25 from their endpoint, I would request that they run a TCP based traceroute to port 25 on your instance as this should help identify how far the packets are making it.

Examples:

sudo tcpdump -w i-2ff8da60.pcap
sudo traceroute -T -p 25 YOUR-IP-HERE
telnet YOUR-IP-HERE 25

Brandon"

Hi Brandon,

they say that they cannot do a traceroute -T because they are on a Windows machine. They say that there are two different IP addresses on the machine and they can telnet the port 25 of our instance only using one of the IP addresses and not using the other.

Amazon EC2	"Re: m3.medium CPU Usage Spikes at 100% and slows down
Hi there,

CloudWatch measures the CPUUtilization as the percentage of allocated EC2 compute units that are currently in use on the instance. This metric identifies the processing power required to run an application upon a selected instance. So when your server CPU Utilization is high, CloudWatch metrics should also show them high.  Refer - http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/viewing_metrics_with_cloudwatch.html 

Now, since we don't have the instance Id details, I am unable to find out the jobs that might be running on the server which is causing the utilization to go high during that time. If you could PM the Instance ID, I will be able to look into it and provide you some more insights.

Amazon EC2	"SELinux on Amazon Linux AMI
I recently enabled SELinux on Amazon Linux 2015.03 (kernel 3.14.48-33.39.amzn1.x86_64). All went well, except for some SELinux AVC's logging in audit.log, pertaining to dmesg, nrpe, syslog, /dev/urandom, and shutdown.

nrpe

I resolved this using a custom policy, but should be incorporated into the distro policy I guess:
require {
        type nrpe_t;
        class capability dac_override;
}
 
#============= nrpe_t ==============
allow nrpe_t self:capability dac_override;

Custom policy to fix this:

        type kmsg_device_t;
        type proc_t;
        type dmesg_t;

This one is again easily resolved using a custom policy:
require {
        type syslogd_t;
        type sysctl_vm_t;
        class dir search;
}
 
#============= syslogd_t ==============
allow syslogd_t sysctl_vm_t:dir search;


/dev/urandom
Resolved by allowing global access:
# Make sure that /dev/urandom can be read by all domains
setsebool -P global_ssp on


shutdown
A whole bunch of devices can't be getattr'ed by the shutdown binary. Resolved by:

Conclusion
I am not a SELinux expert, nor do I know if (some of the) abovementioned AVC's are a result of the hypervisor virtualization architecture used, but I just wanted you to know. Maybe you can incorporate some of the (alleged :-D) fixes into the distro.

Amazon EC2	"Re: Three wordpress sites running on  a m1.small instance one is non responsive
Hi  swelldesigns

Regarding your wordpress hosting, my suggestion would be to have a look first at the apache access logs. Usually this is stored in /var/log/apache2/access.log.
The access logs should tell you which URL(s) is the most called.

A common issue that can be diagnosed using the method above is when robots are calling the ""xmlrpc.php"". Such script which is used for (mostly) inter-site communication can consume a lot of CPU.

A possible solution is to prevent access to this specific files. My suggestion would be to implement a .htaccess rule to prevent the access, or to remove permissions on the file itself.

In addition to the above, you may also want to check the CPU load using ""top"".
This will tell you which process is consuming most of the CPU. It may be possible that other processes may be consuming CPU.

Hope this helps."

Hello,

Your ELB has 2 IP addresses because you have 2 subnets defined.  Both IPs are your ELB, but one of them has no instances behind it.  If you go into the AWS Console->EC2->Load Balancers, then right-click the load balancer and select ""Edit Subnets"".  You then need to remove the subnet that you're not using from the list and hit Save.

The screen shot is for a load balancer for EC2-Classic, so you can change the Availability Zones rather than the subnets. The ""Add and Remove Availability Zones"" dialog box shows you which of your Availability Zones have instances and which are selected for the load balancer.

All this does is allow us to change zones for our instances, which is not the problem. Both of our instances are running only one zone us-east-1a. Again, the problem is that the actual load balancer itself named LB2-206376517.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com resolves to 2 A records from Amazon's DNS server which is wrong:

174.129.27.32
184.73.206.114

174.129.27.32 is not an instance and not in our subnet. 184.73.206.114 is the IP of our load balancer

Coming at it from a different direction -- what about your SSL configuration prevents you from switching to a different ELB?

Amazon EC2	"Re: CRITICAL - LB2-206376517 resolves to 2 different IP addresses
Hi Jason - 

I appreciate the time you took to respond to this thread.

The server residing at 174.xxx.xxx.xxx is owned by someone else and hosted at Amazon. We have no control over that server and it does not match an IP address we've ever had at Amazon. Yet somehow, Amazon's DNS lists this as a second IP address for our load balancer for reasons unknown to us and we see no means of removing it short of setting up a new load balancer. Installing SSL certs on the load balancer has been problematic for us for a myriad of reasons, so we were trying to avoid having to redo that if at all possible, although that likely would solve the issue. We just had no idea we'd be on day 5 of this problem with no resolution. Hindsight I suppose.

Adding to the mystery is the fact that on the foreign server, the www CNAME record correctly resolves to their website (looks like a clothing website of some sort). Yet entering the canonical name of the site displays our website via some sort of URL cloaking.  We've confirmed the website shown when entering their URL is our live site, and not a copy of it, which is what you saw as well with your test.

As I mentioned, we have temporarily mitigated part of the issue by pointing our A record to the 184.xxx.xxx.xxx IP address of the load balancer to ensure the correct IP is used for DNS resolution. That of course will break if Amazon switches our load balancer to a different IP address which say they can do at any time without warning.

The bottom line is we are pretty certain something went bump in the night at Amazon and only Amazon is going to be able to fix the issue. It's been very frustrating that of the two responses we've received from Amazon in the past 5 days that neither addresses the problem.

Amazon EC2	"Re: CRITICAL - LB2-206376517 resolves to 2 different IP addresses
Thank you for escalating the matter and getting the A record for 174.129.27.32 unassigned from our LB. I'll ask the person that handles our DNS to point our A record back to the LB CNAME. Am I to assume that the new IP of 107.20.253.7 that's been assigned to our LB is simply a failover LB and has no chance of being associated with someone else's LB or server? Right now, typing that new IP into a browser brings up our website as it should. I just want to make sure we have no chance of the issue we ran into happening again. I'd also like to better understand what caused this issue to occur in the first place to see if we can avoid it happening ever again.

Now to the consequence of this issue for us. 174.129.27.32 is the resolved IP when navigating to fellipekrein.com.br. This is not our domain and we have no knowledge of it or who owns it. Yet navigating to that domain brings up our website, Partstat. For some reason Google has assigned 6-7 million of our pages to this other domain, which makes addressing the underlying cause very important for us. This morning I put a global 301 redirect in place to try to get Google to move these pages back under our Partstat domain. Prior to the redirect change, typing fellipekrein.com.br into a browser would show our live website while showing their URL in the address bar (URL cloaking?). We've reached out to the website owner per WHOIS but have not received a response. We don't believe this is something intentional on their part, but instead, yet another issue with the configuration of the load balancers and/or servers. Are you able to do something to ensure that their load balancer at Amazon for their domain is NOT pointing to our Partstat instances?

Hello, 

Latency between AZs is designed to be as slight as possible. With that being said you will likely get better response times within the same AZ. My own testing with pinging between some T2.micro instances shows that:

Instances in the same AZ get 0.4 - 0.6ms response times
Instances in different AZ get 1.2 - 1.3ms response times

Amazon EC2	"""Server refused our key"" popping up one day after successful connection
Hi,

I set up several micro instances and use the same key pair for all of them. Each time I set up a new instance I can connect to it successfully with Putty. I generated a .ppk key with Puttygen as suggested and I use ec2-xx-xx-xx-xx.compute-1.amazonaws.com as a hostname and ubuntu as a username. 

I can always connect without any problems after generating a new instance. The problem is that if I try to connect to the same instance a day later or any time after that, I get ""Server refused our key"" and ""Disconnected: No supported authentication methods available (server sent: publickey)"".

Each time, I don't change any of the settings that got me successfully connected the day before, except for updating the host name to the current ec2-xx-xx-xx-xx.compute-1.amazonaws.com. If I create a new instance with the same key pair at that moment I can connect to it right away but the new instance will also stop working about a day later and so on.

The same is true for the Java client offered through the AWS dashboard. I can connect via the Java client after creating a new instance but not any more after a day or so.

Thank you very much, Ahmed, for your quick response. 

Yes, this is the AMI I'm using. I get exactly the same response though if I use the username rstudio instead of ubuntu. 

Also, I was able to successfully and repeatedly connect with the username ubuntu right after creating the instance. It's really only on the next day that I can't connect anymore with the same settings/configuration (and with neither rstudio nor ubuntu username). 

I can connect to the instance via port 80 and a browser at any time, it's just that I want to upload files and connect via SSH which doesn't work. 

I've looked at the two links that you provided but I didn't find any hints on what could cause my problem. 

Any other ideas? Thanks.

Amazon EC2	"Novice Question about MS Office on EC2
I do almost all my work on a Linux platform, except that I need MS Word for document compatibility with the rest of the world. The Office alternatives that run on Linux (Openoffice, LibreOffice) don't produce .doc or .docx files that are completely compatible with MS Office. I would be happy to buy MS Office for Linux if it were available, but it isn't.

A solution that has occurred to me is to create an EC2 instance of WIndows, install MS Office on it, and run this instance ONLY when I need Word.

So here is my question: Is this feasible? When I searched the EC2 forum for ""MS Office"" I saw problems--about licensing and installation. But that's natural: people are going to post about problems, but aren't going to post when they encounter no problems.

What I would like to do is this:

1) Set up a single (small) EC2 instance of WIndows that I run only when I need MS Word.
2) Install MS Office on that instance, and not have to re-install it or run into any licensing or other problems whenever I run that instance again to use Word.
3) Access that Windows instance with some type of terminal from my Linux platform, that allows me to view its Desktop, open Word and edit documents, and save the documents either by copying them to S3 or back to my own Linux machine.

Is the above a feasible scenario or can I expect issues?

If it's feasible, it would be great if someone were to point me to the necessary documentation and/or threads about how to accomplish the above steps, but my main question is whether I should pursue this at all--I would rather not if I'm just going to be pulling my hair out because of problems.

Amazon EC2	"Re: Official AMI changes and updates
Hi Jonathan,

Many thanks for this. That's helpful and will make it a little easier to keep track of the AMI updates. I've got a couple of further questions! Hope that's okay:


It sounds like this is quite a manual process. Is there any way to use this in Cloudformation, short of manually redoing the recipes with the new AMI ID each time we get a notification of an update? For example, can I somehow specify the family name of the AMI (WINDOWS_2012R2_BASE) rather than an AMI ID which will become obsolete? 


I guess if that's not possible, the best approach will be to parameterise the AMI name and write scripts to launch Cloudformation after determining the new AMI ID programatically.    Big problem with this is that the Get-Ec2ImageByName call seems to be powershell-only, and we launch our CloudFormation instances from Linux or Mac workstations... Is there a cross-platform way of doing this?


Maybe I'm missing something - but this command doesn't seem to return the Core versions of these operating system versions! Most of our Cloudformation recipes reference the core versions of the AMIs. How can we work out what the AMI IDs for these are when they change? Maybe I've overlooked something with this command, but surely it must have to return all Windows server AMIs, not just the full graphical environment ones?

Hi there, 

Looking at the instance in Cloudwatch, I can see that you are spiking up and hitting 100% CPU usage at times. This would definitely affect your performance of the instance. 

Take a look at the CloudWatch CPU metrics of this instance from your AWS console, and see if the times that you have experienced these issues, matches with the CPU spikes that are showing on the CloudWatch graphs. 

The underlying host of the instance is confirmed healthy, and not experiencing any issues. 

I would also recommend that you take a look at your windows Event Viewer logs, for any errors or warnings that could be related to the CPU spikes.

Amazon EC2	"Re: node very slow recently
Hello,
thank you for getting back to us.

I reviewed your i-35076bf6 instance details and noticed it is a t2.micro one.
Please let my clarify that t2 instance types use a CPU credit model [1]

When a T2 instance uses fewer CPU resources than its base performance level allows (such as when it is idle), the unused CPU credits (or the difference between what was earned and what was spent) are stored in the credit balance for up to 24 hours, building CPU credits for bursting. When your T2 instance requires more CPU resources than its base performance level allows, it uses credits from the CPU credit balance to burst up to 100% utilization. The more credits your T2 instance has for CPU resources, the more time it can burst beyond its base performance level when more performance is needed.

Having a look at this Cloudwatch metric, it seems that your instance exhausted its CPU Credit balance and therefore performances dropped to baseline ones, even if there are no logged in users or much activity on it.

Hi,

Your Elastic Beanstalk environment has a Load Balancer in it and port 25 is not configured as a listener port in that load balancer. You will need to edit the listener configuration of your load balancer and have it listen to TCP port 25.

You can learn more about ELB listener port configuration here: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/elb-listener-config.html

Amazon EC2	"Issue with EC2 - Auto Scaling Policy not executed
Hello, 

I am looking to use EC2 Auto Scaling feature to spin up an EC2 instance when there is 1 or more messages in an SQS queue. 

To achieve this, I have 2 Cloud Watch alarms. One for when there are messages to process and one when there are not.  Both alarms fire as expected. However, only the spinning up works. 

Where I set the threshold on ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible, the options are for <, <=, >, >=.  I was getting the following error message when this was set to <= 0 and the no messages alarm fired. 

{
  ""actionState"": ""Failed"",
  ""notificationResource"": ""..."",
  ""error"": ""Auto Scaling Policy not executed because it does not specify any action for a metric value of: 0.0"",

Amazon EC2	"System Status Check failure
Hi

I've received ""system check failed"" error messages on i-eaaa3040 (today), and (on the 8th) i-1348d6b9. The most recent failure is visible in the CloudWatch graph for i-eaaa3040 today at around 19:00 GMT on the StatusCheckFailed_System metric.

Hi,

Could anyone please tell me what is the impact if I restart the instance ?

1. Will I loose the current configuration ?
2. Will the IP assigned to it will change( Private VPC used) ?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: Impact of restarting Instance
Hello,
thank you for your contacting us.

Regarding your questions, if your instance is EBS-backed [1], you will not lose any data or configuration either across an instance reboot or a stop/start as they are storage volumes that persist independently from the life of the instance, while if you are using instance store [2], data in the instance store is lost under the following circumstances:
 - The underlying disk drive fails
 - The instance stops
 -  The instance terminates

Regarding ip addresses [3], when you launch an instance, we allocate a private IP address for the instance using DHCP. Each instance is also given an internal DNS hostname that resolves to the private IP address of the instance; for example, ip-10-251-50-12.ec2.internal.

For instances launched in a VPC, a private IP address remains associated with the network interface when the instance is stopped and restarted, and is released when the instance is terminated.

If your instances also have a public ip, we release it when it's stopped or terminated, but not when it's rebooted. As you might it need to perform instance stop/start, we recommend you to consider using Elastic IPs [4] as public ip as they are persistent across stop-starts.

Hello, 

Are you still facing this issue? 

It'd help us troubleshoot if we knew exactly what AJAX calls were being made (To which instance). We'd probably want to take a look at that particular instance's route table and configuration and verify if it's using the new NAT instance and troubleshoot it's own connectivity when in a down state. 

Offhand I think we'd want to know: 
1. Can it reach the internet? 
2. Does it's route table have the correct NAT instance as it's default gateway? 
3. Provide a traceroute to verify traffic is traversing the 'correct' NAT instance. 

Let us know and we can further assist.

Amazon EC2	"Re: ec2 Failover NAT causes 504 Gateway Errors
I ended up fixing the issue in a slightly different way.

If the nat goes down, everything in that AZ is taken down.

On reboot it takes a look at what is working, and what isn't and update the load balancers to bring everything up.  A bit of a brute force sort of item.

1. Can it reach the internet?
 -- Yes it can 

2. Does it's route table have the correct NAT instance as it's default gateway?
 -- The VPNs route table does have the correct gateway

Hi!

I am looking at the possibility of reserving c4.xlarge instances and was using AWS Calculator to determine the cost.

Two questions:

1. We currently use CentOS 6.4 (our own AMI) - do I select Linux/Unix or Red Hat Enterprise when I purchase reserved instances?
2. Apparently there is no 3 year upfront option for c4.xlarge instances in US Standard zone if I select Linux/Unix but there is for Red Hat Enterprise. I am confused by that since AWS Calculator shows me the prices for 3 year upfront for Linux/Unix. Does AWS have some kind of limit on how many instances they sell in each region?

Ive had a few incidents more recently where my ec2 instance became inaccessible. Happened again overnight. Rebooting this morning didn't resolve the problem. But stopping and restarting the instance did. My understanding is that a stop/start will likely result in a change in hardware that the instance runs on. Is the inaccessible problem due to AWS hardware problems or a problem with my Ubuntu instance?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: reboot inacessible ec2 doesn't work. stop/start resolves. ??
Hi,

Its difficult to know exactly where the problem lies without additional information from your instance.  Is your instance peaking its CPU or any other metrics without CloudWatch? 

You are right in thinking that a stop/start will likely spin up the instance on another piece of hardware, so on this occassion it could have been an underlying host issue if a restart didnt work.  Were you getting status check failures? 

I would monitor your CloudWatch metrics to see if issues are arising as time goes on.

Hi,

Even though you are not using EC2 does not mean you have no EBS Storage.  Log in to your AWS Console.  Select 'EC2', select 'volunmes' under 'Elastic Block Store' to see if you have any volumes. If so then this is why you are being charged.

Amazon EC2	"Re: Can not configure auto-recovery on an eligible instance
Hi mehmetdemir

Thank you for your patience.

You are getting this message is because when you first launched your EC2 instance i-3db40930, you have (or via the AMI settings) left the Instance store device mapping.
It's also worth noting that such settings cannot be altered once the instance has launched.

In order for you to use the recovery option, please follow the steps below:

  1 - Log in to the EC2 management console
  2 - Stop your EC2 instance i-3db40930 (double check it's all fine to stop this instance)
  3 - Take an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)(1) of your EC2 instance.
  4 - Then, launch a new EC2 instance using the EC2 management console and ensure there's no extra extra block device mapping when setting your instance storage.
    or alternatively, use the CLI
  4'- aws ec2 run-instances --key-name $KEY --image-id $AMI --instance-type $TYPE --query 'Instances[*].InstanceId' --output text --block-device-mappings '[{""DeviceName"":""/dev/NAME"",""NoDevice"":""""},{""DeviceName"":""/dev/NAME"",""NoDevice"":""""}]' --debug

  5 - Once the instance has launched, enable the instance recovery feature for that new EC2 instance in CloudWatch.

-Change the ""Ec2WindowsActivate"" plugin state to ""Enabled"" (case sensitive)

Amazon EC2	"Re: Reserved instance . Does one pay the hourly fee when it it not running.
The answer to your question is buried in the middle of the EC2 FAQ: http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/
*Q: How do the payment options impact my bill?*

When you purchase an RI under the All Upfront payment option, you pay for the entire term of the RI in one upfront payment. You can choose to pay nothing upfront by choosing the No Upfront option. The entire value of the No Upfront RI is spread across every hour in the term and you will be billed for every hour in the term, regardless of usage. The Partial Upfront payment option is a hybrid of the All Upfront and No Upfront options. You make a small upfront payment, and you are billed a low hourly rate for every hour in the term regardless of usage.
The key words are ""regardless of usage"". 

Reserved instances only make sense when you plan to have an instance running for a large fraction of the time anyway. (Note that it doesn't have to be a single instance continuously running; the reservation will apply to whichever instances happen to be running at any particular point in time.)"

Amazon EC2	"Cannot log into ec2 via ssh even if i create new instance.

Amazon EC2	"Re: Cannot log into ec2 via ssh even if i create new instance.
Hello,

Thank you for the post.

I took a look at your account ending in: 0342 and found that there is only one instance:  i-XXXXXX71 in running state. 

I performed a netcat command on the Elastic IP of this instance and I was able to connect successfully on port 22 (SSH). Please see the command below:
 nc -v 54.X.X.X 22
Connection to 54.X.X.X 22 port tcp/ssh succeeded!
SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_5.8p1 Debian-7ubuntu1

From the above output, it seems that the instance is listening on port 22 (SSH) and accepting connections on it.

Can you please check if you are using the correct SSH keypair? Are you receiving any errors while trying to SSH via PuTTY?

You can refer to this documentation for more information about 'Troubleshooting Connecting to Your Instance': http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstancesConnecting.html

I hope the above information helps.

Hello,

Thanks for posting. Looking at the image you've attached as well as the instance that are running under your account I believe you are attempting to connect to instance i-26e7def5, if this is the case and you wish to connect over the public network, you'll need to configure an IGW in the VPC/Route Table. Currently I only see a local route:

Route Table: rtb-fb00fd9f

172.30.0.0/16 	local 	active

Hello ,

Thanks For the reply , i have seen previously i used all default settings and have continued  to do so , and had no problems in that. However As per my mistake you pointed out , I added the rule 0.0.0.0/32 in the route table with default IGW option that was available. You Can see in the screenshot , also inbound rule in security group is default which allows it ssh to be connected from any place.

Screenshot is Attached.

Also I created A new vpc , a new subnet and allowed rule 0.0.0.0/32 and used default 10.0.0.0/16 as local ips everywhere , and launched new instance into it , it does not show any private nor public ip in ec2 instance Details ?

Looking at the screenshot I do see a private IP of 10.0.121.94. When you created the new VPC/subnet did you enable Auto-assign Public IP?

Auto-assign IP

I would also change your default route for the IGW to 0.0.0.0/0. Please see the following link:

I am trying to add a Comodo wildcard SSL certificate in the Console. I have done this before without too much problem (once I found decent documentation on the correct way to put the cert chain in...). Now I get:

Error creating certificate
Unable to parse certificate. Please ensure the certificate is in PEM format.

I opened the certificate just fine in openssl, DigiCert's Certificate Utility, SSL Shopper's Tools, and in Windows. I used openssl to convert it to DER and back to PEM format just to make sure it was PEM format. I have triple checked there are no extra spaces or empty lines. I've tried submitting it to the ELB with and without the cert chain in the correct order as in the ELB SSL docs (and with and without the Root CA at the bottom of that chain).

I have followed these instructions and many others which say pretty much the same things about converting the private key and chaining the intermediate certificates: http://gc-taylor.com/blog/2013/03/29/namecheap-essentialssl-cert-chain-aws-elb/

Please, can someone suggest something new? Or try to get this cert to work?

Hello,

Can you provide the exact syntax you are using? It amy be that you are not specifying the file correctly.

there is difference in specifying <cert_file> or file://<cert_file> the first option will treat <cert_file> as the body of the certificate (which will result in an invalid certificate error, while file://<cert_file> will use the content of the file as a certificate.

I experienced a similar issue which turned out to be due to my private key not being in PEM format (not the certificate itself).

The private key file should start with:
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

If it starts with:
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----

openssl rsa -in yourdomain.key -outform PEM -out yourdomain_pem.key"

Thank you! I am pretty sure I did that conversion before and it hadn't fixed the issue.

However, Comodo sent me this link which I believe is a bit different from the instructions for Apache OpenSSL that they give during the issuing process:

http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/InstallCert.html

In these instructions it generates a PEM key in one step, and the CSR in a second step.

Anyway, whether that was it or not, this time it worked, and I've made detailed notes for next year!

Amazon EC2	"Re: EC2 instance won't connect even after reboot
Hi,

There might have been an underlying hardware host issues causing the instance to be unreachable.  When restarting your instance it will just restart on the same host.  However, if you stop and restart your instance there is a chance that it would spin up on a different physical host and therefore boot correctly.

Even in the cloud, hardware fails and software becomes unresponsive.  To prevent failures such as this you need to architect such a design.

Hope this helps,

Since the 2014.03 update, most systems with LVM volumes are not able to be checked at boot by fsck.ext4, and thus systems fail to boot (press CTRL+D ...)

I'm able to work around this with the 'nofail' option in /etc/fstab, but just wondering if there is anyway to fix this in the Amazon Linux 2014.03 update?

Previously this was working just fine without the 'nofail' option; LVM volumes were checked properly at boot without issues.  Now all of the LVM volumes (LVs) show as ""nonexistent"" to fsck.ext4 (see below).

The output below is from a machine that had ""nofail"" in the /etc/fstab entries for LVM devices, and thus the system boots fine (and mounts these volumes just fine).  However, I was blindsided when several machines were updated via configuration management and all failed to boot due to this issue. Shame on me for not testing the update on one system first, luckily these were all development systems.

Thanks BenC,

We are in the midst of monthly patching/maintenance, and I had a cluster of 5 systems have this issue, but other systems are not.  I think it may have something to do with ""-"" in the vg/lv names.  However, on one system with ""-"" in the VG name, I renamed it to have a ""_"" with vgrename, and the problem still persists.  With yet another instance with a similarly named VG with a ""-"", it doesn't seem to be a problem.

I missed the Seattle event, though several of my colleagues were there. Maybe next time!

Amazon EC2	"Re: 2014.03 fsck checks fail at boot
Because it's an intermittent failure, you may be able to work around the failure by issuing reboot commands to the instance through the API or using the web console.

If the instance is using EBS for the root volume, you can stop it, detach the volume, attach it to another host, mount the filesystem, and edit /etc/fstab to add the ""nofail"" option to the LVM filesystems. Then reverse the process to attach the volume back to the original instance.

If the instance is using an S3-backed AMI with the root volume stored locally, you should not stop the instance as that will cause the data on the root filesystem to be lost.

Amazon EC2	"Re: 2014.03 fsck checks fail at boot
Hi Victor -

Your issue seems different from the one earlier in this thread: your root filesystem may be corrupt, leading to the errors running modprobe and loading the libext2fs.so.2 shared library.

You can try detaching the root volume as outlined earlier, then run fsck on that volume from a different instance. If the repair is successful, you should be able to mount the filesystem and verify that the contents are intact.

I'd also recommend rebuilding the initramfs on that filesystem to rule out possible corruption there.
chroot /mnt/<dir> /bin/bash
initrd=$(grubby --info=DEFAULT|grep '^initrd='|cut -d= -f2-)
kernel=$(grubby --info=DEFAULT|grep '^kernel=.*/vmlinuz-'|cut -d- -f2-)
dracut -f ${initrd} ${kernel}
exit


Those steps are a bit involved but should work even if the instance you're using to repair the volume is running a different kernel.

Alternatively you could edit /boot/grub.conf to set an older kernel as default.

Then you can unmount the volume and reattach it to the original instance and try the boot again."
Amazon EC2	"Re: 2014.03 fsck checks fail at boot

Hi there,

We are trying to clean up some of these old posts and saw that we have missed responding to this issue, so I apologize for that.

Were you able to see this through? Based on your last response, it appears that initramfs didn't work. Did fsck work? It may be best to update the OS before running the fsck in case there have updates on it to address the issue."

grubby: error while loading shared libraries: libglib-2.0.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

I apologize that I missed your followup response in this thread, and haven't gotten back to you before now.

If I understand correctly, you were using LVM for /usr on the original instance. Libraries such as libglib-2.0.so.0 which live in /usr/lib would be missing if only the root volume was attached to a second instance. This would explain the grubby error.

It would also explain the fsck error - an update to e2fsprogs in the 2014.03 release caused the libraries to move from /lib to /usr/lib. The contents of a separate /usr filesystem would not yet be online when fsck is run on the root filesystem, leading to boot failure.

If you're still attempting to recover this instance, please send me a private message and I can help troubleshoot."
Amazon EC2	"Re: 2014.03 fsck checks fail at boot
glam85 - can you provide more details on your setup?

Do you have /usr on a separate filesystem as well? That could explain why disabling fsck for the root filesystem allows your instance to start."

SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_6.2

From the above output, it seems that the instance is accepting connections on port 22 (SSH). Also, looking at the debug output of the SSH command, this seems to be a permission issue.

You can check the following information in order to troubleshoot this issue further:

Check if the permissions are set up correctly for 'authorized_keys' file under '.ssh' folder and '.ssh' folder under 'ec2-user' home folder and also check if they have the correct owner
Verify that you are connecting with the appropriate user name for your AMI and SSH key pair
You can also check the SSH logs under /var/log/auth.log or /var/log/secure directory to get more information about login failure


Also, for more information about 'Troubleshooting Connecting to Your Instance', please refer to this documentation: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstancesConnecting.html

I hope the above information helps.

Amazon EC2	"Can't stop my instance. It is stuck in the process.
Trying to stop the EC2 instance. It has been stuck for a while. Instance ID: i-7eda543d. 
Also, I'm unable to see my Public DNS and Public IP of my new instance with this ID: i-2673908b.

Can someone help me?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: Can't stop my instance. It is stuck in the process.
Hello,

Thank you for the post.

I took a look at your instance: i-7eda543d and found that this instance is in 'stopped' state at this point in time. If you continue working on this instance, you can perform a start operation which will migrate the instance to a new underlying hardware.

For more information about 'Troubleshooting Stopping Your Instance', please refer to this documentation: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstancesStopping.html

Furthermore, looking at the instance: i-2673908b, I see that this instance is launched in a default VPC. Instances that you launch into a default subnet receive both a public IP address and a private IP address. Instances in a default subnet also receive both public and private DNS hostnames. However, if you change your subnet's default public IP addressing behavior, then your instance may not receive a public IP address and public DNS hostname.

More information about 'Default VPC Public IP address' can be found on this documentation: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-vpc.html#differences-ec2-classic-vpc

I hope the above information helps.

Hello,

Thank you for the post.

I took a look at the instance: i-b9e94672 and found that this instance is terminated at this point in time. Furthermore, it seems that there was an issue with the underlying hardware when you performed a 'terminate' operation, therefore, the instance stuck in 'shutting down' state.

Amazon EC2	"Server becomes unreachable - change root device?
I'm new to AWS so this might be a simple fix - I'm not sure.

I have an EBS-Backed Linux AMI, which starts fine, then sometime later, becomes unreachable. The instance ID is: i-8d9f62c8 and is the volume ID is: vol-4a612856

I've stopped and started the instance and read through the console log (attached), and it sounds like I need to change the root device in the kernel command line but I'm not sure if I can do that while the instance is running.

The log reads: ""You might have to change the root device from /dev/hda-d to /dev/xvda-d in your root= kernel command line option"".

The grub.conf file currently reads:
# created by imagebuilder
default=0
timeout=1

Should I change the root device in the command line or attach the EBS volume to a different root device, and what should that be?

Instance becomes randomly unresponsive; nothing can be reached. I can reboot it, and it works for awhile. The server is virtually unused and Cloud Metrics show it (max 25% cpu spike. hardly any IO, http installed but only available to me as a private server). Centos 7, updated.

Amazon EC2	"Re: Server becomes unreachable - change root device?
My instance just randomly stopped communicating with my RDS instance today, and the logs I'm seeing are almost identical. Any updates on this?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: Server becomes unreachable - change root device?
I'm not sure which steps fixed the issue, but I did the following:

1. I stopped the instance (didn't just restart it) to keep it from constantly throwing alerts.
2. I started the instance to check a few things
3. Upon login, I saw the following:
130 packages can be updated.
64 updates are security updates.

4. I ran the following to update:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

5. I restarted the instance.

Everything is now moving quickly, and my processes ran without issue. I hope this helps."
Amazon EC2	"Attempt to Mount Produces ""wrong fs type""
I have an EBS volume that I have used as a root volume (and am currently using as that). I am attempting to mount it as a secondary volume on another running instance of the same type (Amazon Linux). The volume attaches as /dev/sdj in the AWS interface without a problem, but when I attempt to mount it on the new volume (mount /dev/sdj /mnt     or   mount /dev/sdj /mnt -t ext4) is says it is not an ext4 volume!  But it IS because I can boot off of it as a root Linux partition!

How can I get this volume to mount?

I need to mount it to change some access rules because it currently won't allow me to access it via SSH when booted as a root volume."
Amazon EC2	"Re: Attempt to Mount Produces ""wrong fs type""
In case anyone else runs into this I'll post what I learned:

When attaching as a secondary volume I used to name /dev/sdf

When mounting the secondary volume (using /mnt as the mount point):

mount /dev/sdf1 /mnt -t ext4

(The 1 specifies which partition of the volume to be mounted.)"
Amazon EC2	"High outbound traffic, growing every month
Hello!

We have five instances and the communication between then are through private IP, same AZ. Another instance from another account was recently configured to communicate with peer connection, so traffic is billed as between AZs and not as external.

The ammount of output data reaches 50-100 GB per day. This is not the actual throuput of our application.

We installed Bandwithd but something is not logged.

Our instances:

Until February, the output data was always the same. After that, we looked some new functionality on our application that should justify the double+ output data, but there is nothing.

We would appreciate any help to discover what is going on, because this ammount of output data is growing up every month and we are not happy with the bill 

Thank you!"
Amazon EC2	"Not getting any CPU Credits
What reasons might there be for having a t2.medium instance not accruing any CPU credits for a week-and-a-half despite the maximum CPU usage charts for the last week not going above 10% ?

The credit usage chart shows a total of 61 credits used on the 12th July - but the chart just stops thereafter. The Credit Balance chart shows an average of around 570 from the 10th to the 13th - and then just stops. Neither chart shows anything after those dates - doesn't drop to zero, the line just stops dead.

Thanks in advance."

I have a Windows 2012 RC2 Server instance set up with a server running and a mobile application that connects to this server in order to communicate.

Everyone,
I am trying to install Japanese language support on my 32 bit Amazon Linux AMI and it is proving far more difficult than I imagined.  Has anyone done this yet?"

One clue is that the AWS Linux repo doesn't have any Japanese fonts, but the CentOS repo does. (do --enablerepo=centos on yum installs.)

vlgothic-fonts.noarch : Japanese TrueType font

I'm sure if that fixes the whole problem though."

Amazon EC2	"Re: Asian font support
Hello,

What follows should be a pretty comprehensive list of all the fonts that are in the Amazon Linux AMI repositories, and available for installation on a Amazon Linux AMI 2012.03 instance.

In particular, one of the things we added to the Amazon Linux AMI 2012.03 was Japanese font support with ipa-gothic-fonts, ipa-mincho-fonts, and vlgothic-fonts.

Is there a particular font package that you need which is not on the list?

Amazon EC2	"Best practices for moving a program to the cloud
My company has just started to investigate the best method for moving our software to the cloud without a complete rewrite.  The program is a WinForms program developed in Visual Studio 2010 using the dot Net 4.0 framework with a MySQL database.

We have experimented with several different EC2 setups including RDP and using an OpenVPN server, both approaches have there positives and negatives.  Is there a different approach using what is available through Amazon Web Services that might be a better setup for this type of program?

Beside Cost is there anything to be gained by using Reserved Instances over On-Demand(better performance)?

Any feedback on this kind of setup is greatly appreciated."
Amazon EC2	"Re: Best practices for moving a program to the cloud
Hello,

I think you'll get the most value by trying to go as native as possible, meaning using RDS for the MySQL database and if possible using Elastic Beanstalk for the .Net components.  Granted, that may require some level of rewriting and I don't know if there is any tolerance for doing so.  It wouldn't be complete but could be non-trivial if the application isn't tiered already.

Another option would be something like Amazon Workspaces to which you could deploy the WinForms components.  The simplest, which you've identified, is to deploy Windows servers on EC2 instances.  That has the advantage of getting things into the cloud but, in my mind, I would want to make sure there's a compelling reason for doing so (lack of internal expertise for server admin, cost of internal maintenance, etc).

Though it's not entirely clear from your post, a VPC connection with a hardware VPN is probably necessary if the WinForms are accessed only from your internal network.

Another consideration is the amount of bandwidth needed if internal users will be using the WinForms in the cloud.  That may change lag/latency for the end users.

Finally, keep backups in mind.  Make sure data is copied off of AWS regularly and securely.

If you're intent on moving to the cloud, then I would try for the goal of using as many native services as possible.  RDS is a logical and typically easy first step that shouldn't require much rewriting.  If possible to use Elastic Beanstalk then doing so enables better scaling.

Hope this helps.

You cannot verify domain ownershop via mx records, but via txt or cname record. Or via a html file.

So maybe thats why.

I am trying to import a Windows 2003 Server, Web Edition into EC2.

Amazon EC2	"How can I know why requests are queued into SurgeQueue?
Hi folks,

According to https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/elb-capacity-troubleshooting/,  some of the reasons that a load balancer can have a high max statistic for the SurgeQueueLength metric include:
Overloaded back-end instance(s) – Back-end instance resources—CPU, memory, and network—might be overloaded and unable to adequately process incoming requests.
Application dependency issues – Modern web applications can have multiple depencencies on external resources such as databases, S3 buckets, or other applications. If there are performance issues with an application's external dependencies, the application's performance is affected. For example, if an application is dependent on a database table that is not properly indexed, database performance can hinder the application's performance.
Max connections reached – Back-end web servers might have reached their maximum allowable connection limit and be unable to process new requests.

What I am wondering is how to identify which reason among Overloaded back-end instance(s), Application dependency issues and Max connections reached  causes it happen actually? When request is queued in SurgeQueue."

Amazon EC2	"Re: setting an alarm for multiple instances
Hello,

Thanks for posting. In order to select 'Across All Instances' you'll want to make sure you have detailed monitoring enabled:

Aggregate statistics are available for the instances that have detailed monitoring enabled. Instances that use basic monitoring are not included in the aggregates. In addition, Amazon CloudWatch does not aggregate data across Regions. Therefore, metrics are completely separate between Regions. Before you can get statistics aggregated across instances, you must enable detailed monitoring (at an additional charge), which provides data in 1-minute periods.


Please see the following Detailed Monitoring.

Amazon EC2	"Cannot connect to EC2 Instance via Remote Desktop Connection
Hello everybody,

I have created an Instance of SAP Business Warehouse 7.4 incl. SAP Business Objects BI 4.1 SP2 on SAP HANA 1.0 SP in the SAP Cloud Application Library.
After activation it shows green in CAL (status is active). In the AWS Account in EC2 it is also showing the instance as active.

But when I try connecting to it using the Remote Desktop Connection it is not working.

I get an error message: ""Remote desktop cannot connect to the remote computer for one of these reasons: 1)Remote access to server is not eabled 2)The remote computer is turned off 3) The remote computer is not available on the network.

Neither did it work by using the the provided RDP from SAP nor by entering the IP manually.
I tried it from my home network, via vpn (company network) and UMTS. 

Results were all the same...

RDP is activated in the security Group in AWS and when I try to reach the Port 3389 by portquiz.net:3389 it's working fine.
I also tried Telnet IP:3389 in the cmd and got the following message:
A Connection with the host couldn't be established, on Port 23: Connection Error.

Another Person also tried to Telnet the instance but also got an error. But he is definitely able to Telnet other AWS instances with this port from the same Network.
At the Moment the instance is stopped as I can't connect to it anyway but i can activate it anytime if needed.
It's just frustrating when it causes costs and can't be used

Hi there,

The one thing that you want to make sure is that your Security Group associated with that instance is set up to receive traffic on a specific port that Plex Media Server needs to function. Presently, I only see SSH port explicitly specified in your security group.

Looking at Plex's troubleshooting page, what you can do is set a static port number and make sure that you've allowed that port number in your AWS EC2 security group from the source IP of the client machine. Then from your machine, you can run a quick test to make sure that the port is indeed open and ready to serve traffic by running the following (let's pretend your instance IP is 1.2.3.4 with port 32400):

$ telnet 1.2.3.4 32400
Trying 1.2.3.4...
Connected to 1.2.3.4.

If you see something like this, then you'll know that traffic is servable at that port. I hope this helps!"

Brian,
The way that httpd22, httpd24, php, and php56 are packaged in Amazon Linux does not allow them to be installed on an instance at the same time. This is why they are marked as conflicts. We did change the packaging in php55 and php56 that allows them to be installed on the system at the same time, but this work has not been done on older version of php (php and php54).  What you are trying to accomplish cannot be done with Yum or RPM using the packages provided in the Amazon Linux AMI repositories. 

One way to solve this is to use docker and containers to be able to run both of these versions in their own container on the same instance.

Amazon EC2	"Re: Upgrading httpd and php without uninstalling
There is a short way, and long way to upgrade. The short way is to just launch a new instance, install the php version you want on it, and move you data over. The long way requires that you remove all php packages, and install a newer version (except if you are moving from php55 to php56). 

To upgrade, you'll need to completely uninstall all php packages, and any packages that depend on the core php packages. There is no solution for doing in-place PHP upgrades using yum when going to php54, php55, or php56 from the default php packages. How I typically do it is this:
1. I get a list of all php packages installed. For example: 
 rpm -qa | grep php 

2. From that I build a list of packages to install, replacing any core, and php binary module packages with the equivalent php55 package. Any php-module package (such as php-mbstring) will need to be changed to php55-module name. Also, any pecl package will need to match the version of php being installed. 
3. The command:
 sudo yum remove php-common 

will remove almost all php packages. There might be some clean up needed.
4. Once the packages are uninstalled, install the new, later version php packages. 

As mentioned above, your exact method might be different depending on your operational procedures and application requirements."

  3) Configured default-ssl.conf with the correct VirtualHost directive (example.com:443)
  4) Added an allow from all HTTPS rule to my security group
  5) Used iptables to (theoretically) open port 443
  6) Enabled the default-ssl site via a2ensite
  7) Restarted apache many times during this process, rebooted the machine a couple as well just for good measure

Apache starts without error, and reports that OpenSSL/1.0.1f is resuming normal operations.

Does your configuration include the

You can use the netstat -an command to see what ports are in the listen state. If it's not listed in there, then the OS will refuse the connection automatically."

Yes, I've got ""Listen 443"" in my ports.conf file (This is Ubuntu 14.04, so much of my confusion may be stemming from the fact that the conf files don't behave like many other distros).

Additionally, if I attempt to put Listen 443 directly in the apache2.conf file, I have the same result (i.e. a closed 443 port).

netstat -an in fact does not list 443, despite all my efforts. 80, 22 and 3306 (mysql) are there and working fine. I'm completely at a loss how to get 443 on that netstat list under a LISTEN state.

One change: I remembered putting ""Listen 443"" in my ports.conf file but apparently during my many forum trawls I had changed that to ""Listen 80 443"". I separated the ""Listen 80"" and ""Listen 443"" into two separate lines, and now netstat -an reports a LISTEN listing for :443.  nmap -p 443 localhost (executed from server I'm configuring) reports that 443 is open.

Amazon EC2	"Re: 443 closed, 80 fine, exhausted all options after 6 hrs of debugging
OK, what does the line in netstat -an look like? If it's 0.0.0.0:443, then that is listening on all IP ports, but if its the locahost 127.0.0.1, then it'll only work within the machine.

No, that looks fine. It's just ip6 formatting.

There may be a problem with your iptables configuration. While that rule allows new traffic, there needs to be rules that allow existing connections to keep working.  Check what the default action is on the INPUT table. It's the policy given in the title of the table.

I don't use iptables to control traffic, I use the AWS VPC configuration to control what protocols and ports are open. I find its easier."

EC2 instances come with an ENI, but if you need additional ENI's you can provision them as needed. To do what you describe, you can route traffic to a particular ENI/EC2 instance with your VPC's route table. You can read more on Route Tables here:

Amazon EC2	"Re: Creating a Network
Thanks for the response.

I think using a route table will partially accomplish what I need. It looks like with the first entry of the route table (Destination:10.0.0.0/16 Target:local), all traffic between two instances within the subnet will not be routed to the particular instance that will be recording the packets. Is that correct? If so, is there a way to get around that?

Edit: After giving more thought to my goal, I have figured out that it is not important if the internal traffic is not routed to the instance.

After the traffic has been routed to the instance (Destination:0.0.0.0/0 Target:<instance_id>), how is it then forwarded to the internet gateway?

Hi guys,

We are trying to move our application to a Autoscaling cluster but we're having one very annoying issue. 

The app we're trying to move is pretty big, the S3 bucket is about 400 mb of code. When I copy this from S3 onto a EC2 server ourselves it takes about 5 minutes max. But if I run this as a User-data script in Auto-scaling it takes an eternity. All our script does is:

sudo mkdir -p /var/www
sudo aws s3 cp s3://<bucket-name>/code/latest/ /var/www/ --recursive
sudo chown -R www-data.www-data /var/www/ 
sudo service apache2 graceful


An t2.medium instance created by auto-scaling that runs this script runs at 100% cpu for at least 20 minutes.

Top shows tee and aws fighting for cpu time.

I however cannot connect.  I don't believe I ever even get to the key exchange:

telnet 52.4.82.235 22
Trying 52.4.82.235...
telnet: connect to address 52.4.82.235: Connection timed out

I get a similar result with my ssh client.

Hi,

When troubleshooting connectivity to your instances check the following:

1. Ensure the correct ports in the Security Group are open that is associated with your instance
2. Ensure the NACL associated with your subnet that the instance resided in have the relevant ports open
3. Ensure you have an Internet Gateway associated with your VPC
4. Ensure there is a route associated to the subnet that your instances resided in that points out to the public internet, for example.... 0.0.0.0/0 via IGW
5. Ensure you have a public IP address associated to your instance

Amazon EC2	"Re: Cannot SSH into new instance
Hi,

No, that is just an explicit DENY at the end of the rule table.  The rules are read from the lowest number first.  At the end of every NACL there is an explicit DENY, which is what the * is denoted by.  

You can also deleted Rule 200 from the inbound connection as that is a duplicate of rule 100.

The free tier offers 30 GB of storage, which has been exceeded according to this information. Any usage outside of the free tier limits will be charged. The 30 GB limit means that you can keep a single 30 GB EBS volume for a full month. A larger volume would consume the 30 GB limit in less time.

Amazon EC2	"Re: Auto Scaling Launch Configuration with c4 instance as a Spot Instance
After a bit of playing around with Chrome's JS debugger, it appears the issue is only with accounts/regions that have access to both VPC and Classic.  When an account has both VPC and Classic in a region, the launch configuration JavaScript will attempt to display the Classic spot prices; however, there aren't any for the latest instance type classes, such as c4.  AWS reps are normally unable to reproduce this because they test using VPC-only accounts/regions by default, in which cause the launch configuration screen will correctly display the VPC spot prices.

I've contacted AWS support, and they're looking into the issue.  In the meantime, you can work around the problem by creating your launch configurations using the CLI toolkit.  You can also use your browser's developer tools (i.e., ""Inspect Element"") to change the ""Not available"" spot status text to anything else, which will bypass the broken JavaScript check."

The strangest thing happened this morning - an elastic IP that I had associated with an instance for the past couple months suddenly disassociated itself.

Hello, 

The EC2 instances themselves have been running for over 100 days. You can verify this by looking at ""Launch Time"" under under your EC2 instance's description from the management console. 

This tells you how long the instance has been up and running, but is completely unaware of the OS's restarts. You can generally gather some information form the system console logs by right clicking on your instance, clicking ""Instance Settings"", and clicking ""Get System Log"". However in Windows by default not much information is recorded here, it does however look like it captured that the restart happened. 

To further investigate you'll want to take a look at your OS's system logs and event viewer to verify why these systems restarted.

Hello, 

Where you able to resolve this issue? 

A few things you'd want to verify:
1. The route table in use has a default route pointing towards your IGW and that an IGW is attached to your VPC. 
2. Network ACLs on the subnet your instance is launched into aren't blocking the traffic. 
3. That you launched the instance with a public IP. 

I see that presently the instance is terminated, and I'm not able to historically verify this information for you.

Amazon EC2	"Beginner Question about Deleting Snapshots
I wanted to be 100% sure about this before I deleted any snapshots.
To create a snapshot I go to my AWS Console and click ""Create Snapshot"", pick a volume, name the snapshot, and it runs just fine.  I plan to setup an automated snapshot, but that's a different topic.  I now want to go and delete unnecessary snapshots but wanted to make sure that would not alter any of the data on the volume the snapshot is based on.
So, deleting a snapshot does not remove any data from a volume or affect and instance in any way, correct?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: Beginner Question about Deleting Snapshots
Hello,

When you delete a snapshot, only the data exclusive to that snapshot is removed. Deleting previous snapshots of a volume do not affect your ability to restore volumes from later snapshots of that volume.

If you make periodic snapshots of a volume, the snapshots are incremental so that only the blocks on the device that have changed since your last snapshot are saved in the new snapshot. Even though snapshots are saved incrementally, the snapshot deletion process is designed so that you need to retain only the most recent snapshot in order to restore the volume.

Note that you can't delete a snapshot of the root device of an EBS volume used by a registered AMI. You must first deregister the AMI before you can delete the snapshot.

Amazon EC2	"Nginx HTTP 499 caused by ELBs issue, any ideas?
Hi,

for the past few days we've been encountering weird behaviour from two of our Load Balancers:

alchemy-1914954519.eu-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com
alchemy-tracking-lb-25465845.eu-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com

For what is now the second time in 4 days both ELBs have started misbehaving without any apparent reason. In diagnosing the issue we noted multiple things:


The latency goes to the 60s limit, with the EC2 instances reporting no load and being reachable and apparently working fine (reported as InService).
We are running Nginx as our backend server, and when the issue starts Nginx begins to reply in HTTP 499 only. We are not running anything heavy and the typical response should take no longer than a 100ms or so. 


I am not entirely sure how these symptoms are related, but we are being left without any option as we have fully ruled out an issue on our back end code, and the investigation we have lead only gave us clues and no answer. Apart from the fact that issue is most likely on the ELBs, which we can't properly diagnose.

Has someone encountered similar issues? Can someone at Amazon take a look at these ELB instances to check if everything is in order?

For the second time now the issue seems to have resolved itself after a few hours. However we are still without any ideas as to what happened and how to prevent it from happening in the future.We are extremely worried at the behaviour of these ELB and the overall black box that they are prevents us from doing diagnosis on any occurring issue, specially a critical one such as this.

Not sure how often supports comes here, but given the nature of the issue, should we not hear from AWS on this we'll just take our servers to Linode, as this is the second time in less than a week ELBs have cause significant interruption of service for our clients.

We have two instances running nginx each in a different availability zone in US-WEST-1. We serve our customers domains, they simply just create an A record at their DNS provider pointing to our IP.

Hello,
thank you for your request, I understand your use case: I'm sorry to hear that AWS Elastic Load Balancer don't fit your needs.
Regarding your questions:
 1) Unfortunately it is not possible to associate a single Elastic Ip address to both instances, you can just associate it to only one of them. [1]
 2) No, as described in RFC 1033 [2], it's not possible to create a CNAME at zone apex: however, as you might already know, Route53 has ""Alias"" support for specific use cases (ex. Cloudfront distributions, ELBs, S3 buckets or other Amazon Route 53 resource record set. [3]

If you have a huge number of domains requiring SSL, we would recommend you to consider using SSL Server Name Indication (SNI) and buying multi-domain certificates to avoid running (and managing several certificates) on multiple instances.

Amazon EC2	"Apache: ""[mpm_prefork:error] server reached MaxRequestWorkers""
We are running a news website which has large volumes of spikey traffic at unpredictable times. And most of the times, whenever concurrent traffic goes high, our EC2 apache error_log says: ""mpm_prefork:error server reached MaxRequestWorkers"" and fails to process further visitor requests - it hangs. The only way to come out of that state is to SSH login to the EC2 instance and do a 'sudo service httpd restart' every time this happens and only then the server starts processing normally again. Sometime later, for another volume of spikey traffic we will again see it happen the same way which would require us solving it the same way again.

The default MaxRequestWorkers setting given by apache is 256. Then we raised it to:
512 - still facing same problem after a larger concurrent traffic
1024 - still facing same problem after an even larger concurrent traffic
2048 - still facing same problem after an even even larger concurrent traffic
It can't keep going on like this.

I want to know, why can ""mpm_prefork:error server reached MaxRequestWorkers"" happen? What do I need to work on to ensure we don't hit these limits for spikey traffic?"

Hi there syedrakibalhasan,

I am unable to find any EC2 instances associated with your account. If you would like to continue investigating this issue please provide the relevant resource IDs.

Moving on to generic information. Looking at the issue that you are having and the information around for it, it seems that if you are going to be increasing the MaxRequestWorkers you also need to increase ServerLimit, as documented in the below


https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mpm_common.html#maxrequestworkers\


Once we have the resource IDs we can look at the details of your use case and make architectural recommendations as required to implement things like Auto Scaling Groups, Elastic Load Balancers and Cloudfront, depending on the scale required.

I ended up fixing my problem. For others who might be having the same issue, here's what I did:

1. Create new instance with the same OS as your broken instance.
2. Stop instance that is not allowing connections.
3. Detach root volume from broken instance and attach it to the new instance.
4. Login to the new instance and mount the attached volume.
5. Navigate to the ""authorized_keys"" file on the attached volume from the broken instance, and chmod the ""authorized_keys"" file with 755 permissions (this should only be temporary).
6. Stop the newly created instance, detach the volume that you detached from the broken instance, and re-attach the volume to its original instance.
7. Start the instance, and now you should be able to login. Remember to chmod the ""authorized_keys"" file to your desired settings."
Amazon EC2	"High IO wait times
Over the last couple of days I've been seeing higher than normal io wait times on one of my instances. Yet looking at my disk stats for the last 3 weeks, nothing has really changed from a usage perspective. I have a normal daily spike when backups are being run, but then that settles down prior to the server's peak operation times.

The AWS status page is not reporting any issues, yet I can't see anything out of the ordinary on the server to indicate why this is happening.

The instance is in the ap-southeast-2a zone and I am seeing the wait value sit between 30-60% fairly consistently. Server load, which normally operates at about 1-2 during peak times has been fluctuating between 4-12 most of this time. All other usage values seem to be within the norm, but IO Wait is still high.

Any ideas on what might be causing this? Any issues that have not made their way to the status page yet?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: High IO wait times
What type of volume and what type of instance? 

Ephemeral drives are local to your host machine, and you compete with other users for that host computer's bus for access to the drive controllers.  Getting a new neighbor with different usage patterns could impact your performance, although we try really hard to limit that.

EBS drives are remote, so you compete for network resources, but we offer some optimizations that control a lot of that variability.  

A large-scale problem that impacts a significant number of customers would be posted to the status page, but day-to-day variability, and issues on a single host machine will not be."
Amazon EC2	"Re: High IO wait times
Thanks for the response Michael, the instance is an M3.Large and the volume is an EBS.

Funnily enough though, about 20 minutes ago the IO Wait times dropped right back down to what they normally sit at, which is generally no more than about 5%. However, nothing is different from a usage perspective and iotop is showing the same disk usage patterns, so I can only think that another user's instance or a platform issue was causing problems.

UPDATE - scratch that, after about 30 minutes of normal low wait values, it's all of a sudden back hovering between 35-85%, but again usage stats from the server have not changed. CPU is low, disk read/writes are only a few MB/s but IO Wait is really high and causing massive load surges. There is nothing reported on the status, but there must be something causing this.

My instances are in Availability Zone ap-southeast-2a.

Amazon EC2	"Re: High IO wait times
OK, Thanks for that Michael, it's settled back down again now.

I had simply tried rebooting the instance using the standard OS commands. However based on your comment I'm assuming that this keeps it on the current host as it's not being fully stopped and started again. Am I correct in thinking that?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: High IO wait times
Yes, exactly.  When you reboot your instance, it stays on the same host.  You have to shut down your instance to get it to jump hosts.

If you think of the virtual hosts like real hosts, then rebooting is just hitting the reset button and your machine doesn't move.  However, when you power-off a machine, we unplug it, pull it out of the rack, and put it in storage.  When you launch it again, we pull it out of storage, put in in a different rack, hook back up all the cables, and hit the power button."

Hello Mong,

I did check your instance i-9701ab5b and it is passing 2/2 status checks.
Also, I did run a netcat session against port 22 and 80 of your instance and it returned me the following.
$ nc -zv 54.xxx.xxx.57 22

$ nc -zv 54.xxx.xxx.57 80

This indicates that SSH service is running properly on your instance and you should be able to connect to your instance using SSH. However, your instance was refusing connections made to HTTP port (TCP Port 80). This indicates that there is no service listening on TCP port 80. This could be because the web service on your instance is not started or is failing to start. I would recommend you to login to your instance and check this. If the web service is failing to start, you will have to take a look at the logs to see why it is failing.

I have been given the business logic of 

a) A customer makes a request for services through

c) Data retrieval

Currently this is implemented by statically giving each user an EC2 instance to use to handle their requests.  (This instance actually creates some sub instances to parallel process the data).

What should happen is that for each request, an EC2 instance be fired off automatically.

Amazon EC2	"Re: Are Spot instances auto-starting and persistent?
Hi,

Yes, your Spot Instance request is fulfilled when there is available capacity and your bid price is greater than the current Spot price. If you create a one-time request, we won't automatically launch another Spot Instance when the Spot price decreases; you can submit another request when you would like another Spot Instance.

You will need a persistent data store for your session state, such as an Amazon S3 bucket or an Amazon EBS volume. If you store your data on an Amazon EBS volume, you can ensure that it persists after the instance is terminated when you create it. The EBS volume is automatically detached from a Spot Instance when it terminates, and you can ensure that it is attached to your new Spot Instance when you submit your request.

Greetings,

Today we have received an Abuse Report 12834920818-6 from a claimed domain that we don't have contact with. Yet our server -as per our audit- didn't attempt to connect with or attack (as claimed ).. However this kind of message could put our business at risk and would like to know how to handle this or assure that the reporter is contactable party (so far we couldn't reach the reporter and the domain for us looks not a real party.

Kindly advice on how to act and what should be the next to secure our business with AWS without the risk or losing our data..

the following are a quick brief of the message/report we have received.

Thanks in advance.

Amazon EC2	"Re: Your Amazon EC2 Abuse Report [12834920818-6] !!
Hello,

Thanks for posting. I apologize for the issues you've encountered. The very first thing I would do is to implement an iptables rule on this instance and log any attempts to connect to the IP mentioned. This way you can review your logs and and verify that there are no actual attempts trying to connect to this IP. Please see the following example, replace <IP-HERE> with the IP in question and that if you reboot or stop/start the instance you'll have to add them again (alternatively you could add them to rc.local so they would be executed at boot time):

sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -d <IP-HERE> -j LOG --log-prefix 'EC2 ABUSE: '
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -d <IP-HERE> -j DROP


You mentioned that your investigation has not appeared to turn up anything on this so I'm assuming you've done the basics like verifying software/applications are up to date and that you've thoroughly reviewed your logs for indications of intrusion or issues with the software that is currently running within your instance. The above is outlined in the article that was also included in the email.

Once you've completed that please continue to monitor the logs and if you do find that there are attempts to connect to this IP or if you find other indications that your instance has been compromised or an application is not behaving properly you will have to look into this further. 

Regards,
Brandon"

Many Thanks for your prompt response.

Does this kind of reports puts our server on risk of sudden termination/suspension or there will be alerts/notifications before you do so? Sorry for confusion but we are worrying since we heard stories of sudden accounts terminations without prior notice. Of course from our side we will do our best to follow and respect the AWS's terms of user..

From my personal experience as long as you are responsive to the notifications and show an effort to fix the issues then you should be fine. So it's important to make sure the abuse notifications you receive aren't being filtered to an unmonitored account/folder.

Are the instances in a Subnet which has a proper route to your client? Do your security groups allow access inbound on port 22 from your clients IP?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: ssh connection refused
Hello,

The message connection refused indicates that there are no service listening on the associated port. This means that sshd service is not running on port 22. Could be that it failed to start due to some reason or you have a custom sshd configuration which runs on a different port instead of TCP port 22.

I would recommend you to verify your sshd configuration and also check the logs if there is something indicating the failure of ssh service during instance start up. Or may be you could have disabled the sshd to start automatically during boot.

You'll usually see this response when the service isn’t running or a firewall is rejecting the connection.

I see your security groups are allowing tcp 22 connections at this time. I'd check to make sure there isn't a software firewall or other application blocking the connection. I'd also check to makes sure the sshd service is running.

If you don't have another way to log into the instance then you'll need to do an offline recovery.
This means you'll need to stop the instance, detach the root volume, and attach it as a secondary device on another working instance.

When you stop a running instance, the following happens:

• The instance performs a normal shutdown and stops running (the status goes to stopping and then stopped)
• The instance retains its instance ID
• Any Amazon EBS volumes remain attached and the data persists
• Any instance store volumes don't persist
• The instance won't keep its public and private IP addresses. The exception is that instances launched in a VPC keep the same IP address when stopped and restarted.
• Any Elastic IP address mapped to the instance is unmapped. For Amazon VPC instances, the Elastic IP address remains associated with the stopped instance. When you restart the instance, the Elastic IP address is active. While the Elastic IP address is associated with the stopped instance, you're charged for the Elastic IP address.

Amazon EC2	"aws cli filter matching when it shouldn't (gotcha)
Just prior to posting I figured this out, but thought it worth posting in case is helps someone else out, perhaps a clarification in the official docs?

Be very careful with quotes and commas - and pass each filter option as a separate argument (don't put them in a single argument even if you do separate each pair with whitespace as per the guide at 
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-images.html.

This is just wrong (all the options are seen as valid values of the ""tag:Stage: name:
aws ec2 describe-images --filter Name=tag:Stage,Values=deploy,Name=tag:Env,Values=test --query 'Images[].[ImageId,Tags[?Key=='\''Stage'\''].Value|[0]]'


This is better but - it matches ""test"" instead of deploy?!
$ aws ec2 describe-images --filter ""Name=tag:Stage,Values=deploy Name=tag:Env,Values=test"" --query 'Images[].[ImageId,Tags[?Key=='\''Stage'\''].Value|[0]]'
ami-0d28e066	test
ami-3f2ae254	test


This is correct - you must pass in the filter list as separate arguments, the docs are unclear here as it says ""space"" so as a good sysadmin I carefully had the space in quotes in the version above.
$ aws ec2 describe-images --filter Name=tag:Env,Values=test Name=tag:Stage,Values=deploy --query 'Images[].[ImageId,Tags[?Key=='\''Stage'\''].Value|[0]]'
ami-4128e02a	deploy
ami-8d12dbe6	deploy
ami-b312dad8	deploy
ami-e916de82	deploy


You can of course also put each argument in quotes (normal shell protection):
$ aws ec2 describe-images --filter ""Name=tag:Env,Values=test"" ""Name=tag:Stage,Values=deploy"" --query 'Images[].[ImageId,Tags[?Key=='\''Stage'\''].Value|[0]]'

Amazon EC2	"Instance stuck in Stopping State
We have a production instance (i-187f6576) that is stuck in a stopping state.  This is on hardware that has failed and we received email notice of this failure.  I'm concerned about ensuring the integrity of this volume since there is data that has not been backed up.

Steps I've taken:
1)  Tried stopping this instance.  When I began the stopping process, the console said it couldn't communicate with this instance.
2)  Taken a snapshot of the volume as the instance has been in this stopping state.

Not being that familiar with AWS, unsure of my next steps.  Should I a) force detach the volume and start a new instance from the AMI? or b) create a new volume from the snapshot and re-assign our elastic IP to this new instance?  or c) Should someone from Amazon stop this instance and I can create a new instance based on the AMI with the current volume.

Thank you for any help."

Hi Matt,

Your EC2 instance has successfully stopped. Your EC2 instance was residing on a underlying-host that was experiencing an issue. You may start your instance back up again so it can migrate over to a new healthy underlying-host.

Amazon EC2	"Re: Access Instance SSH - Permission denied (publickey)
Hi  tempotelecom,

A couple of things you could try.

1.) Confirm the permissions on the KEY.pem file are 400
2.) Looks like it's attempting to load a key from a known_hosts file, you could attempt to delete the key from the known_hosts file and try again.

Regards,

Amazon EC2	"Re: Access Instance SSH - Permission denied (publickey)
Hi Rodney;

Thanks for the replies. I realized both items and the problem persists. Do you have any more suggestions?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: Access Instance SSH - Permission denied (publickey)
Hi  tempotelecom,

I would double check the permissions on /home/ec2-user/.ssh and also the authorized_keys file, make sure they are readable by the user attempting to log in. 

If you don't have another way to log into the instance you'll need to stop said instance and detach the root volume and attach it as a secondary device to another working instance.

When you stop a running instance, the following happens:

• The instance performs a normal shutdown and stops running (the status goes to stopping and then stopped)
• The instance retains its instance ID
• Any Amazon EBS volumes remain attached and the data persists
• Any instance store volumes don't persist
• The instance won't keep its public and private IP addresses. The exception is that instances launched in a VPC keep the same IP address when stopped and restarted.
• Any Elastic IP address mapped to the instance is unmapped. For Amazon VPC instances, the Elastic IP address remains associated with the stopped instance. When you restart the instance, the Elastic IP address is active. While the Elastic IP address is associated with the stopped instance, you're charged for the Elastic IP address.

Amazon EC2	"Troubleshooting CPU Spikes / Non-Responsive T2.Small Instance
I have a T2.Small instance hosting a client web site utilizing SQL Server Express on the same instance. 
Our site usually has around 30-40 unique users login daily so it is not super high traffic. 

About once or twice a day we see a CPU spike to 100% for a few minutes and the site/SQL becomes completely unresponsive.  The main side effect we see are SQL Timeouts with clients attempting to Login or perform various tasks on the web site. 

At this point I am trying to understand what is occurring with the site. I am running a SQL Trace today to try and identify if there are specific SQL queries/procs etc that is bogging down or locking a table in SQL but I am not convinced SQL is the issue. 

We were running a T2.Micro instance and saw the same behavior so I upgraded the T2.Small when we saw the CPU Spikes in CloudWatch. With T2.Small, we are seeing the same behavior. 

Does a T2.Small instance ""throttle"" CPU if too many CPU Units are used up in a given period?   Could there be other factors hitting my instance I am not considering? Any advice would be appreciated. 

The instance having problems is the single instance in the N. Virginia region.

I am transferring data from a New York datacenter to AWS-Oregon (instanceid: i-e4a69512).

I am guessing that when I LAUNCH the AMI... that the correct selections for the AMI are launched. Maybe the AMI will not launch on a T2.Micro?  But that seem weird.  Shouldn't it be AMI + EC2 = Free tier... Or can't Amazon calculate that?

Amazon EC2	"Re: Step 2: Choose an Instance Type = ""Free tier eligible"" but Step 7: Review I
Stooby and all,

Thanks to Stooby, 

Yes... you are right the amount of storage requested by the AMI is over the free tier limit. Amazon AWS does no checking to tell where and overage might occur. In this case, the AMI is requesting (see attached) Root of 30 gp2 and the free tier limit is, ""Free tier eligible customers can get up to 30 GB of EBS General Purpose (SSD) or Magnetic storage."" 

I know this for sure because when I got the combination of EBS and Magnetic under 30 (I tried 15  and 15), then I did not get the ""Costs More Than Free Tier Message.""

Of course then I got another error, the AMI requires EBS of 40GiB... different problem, but now I get it! I can buy the extra storage and run the AMI or not run the AMI. Easy decision."

Amazon EC2	"Re: Volume Availability
Hello,

Thank you for the post.

If you are attaching a newly created EBS volume, after you attach it to your instance, it is exposed as a block device. You can format the volume with any file system and then mount it. After you make the EBS volume available for use, you can access it in the same ways that you access any other volume. Any data written to this file system is written to the EBS volume and is transparent to applications using the device.

For more information about 'Making an Amazon EBS Volume Available for Use', please refer to this documentation: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ebs-using-volumes.html#using-ebs-volume-windows

I hope the above information helps.

Hi people!

I've several weeks, trying to find any solution for improve the startup time for each instance that I need to launch.

First; I tried to know the time trought bootchart, but I believe that not is real time. I tried fter see it with bootchart with VNC server and webmin. (Of course webmin, I believe not is the correct tool). And bootchart just gives us only the proccess of instance not extra packages.

Second; I thought, in to delete unnecessary packages, but reading several forums; this is a hard task; and means compilate again the kernel (pckages like bluetooth comes with the kernel); but knows the correct list to know which packages, is hard.

Third; when I tried to install VNC server/service, I can't used it fine. Someone could install it good?

Fourth; with xcfe4 I could to use sudo but with ubuntu-desktop no. Any idea?

Fifth: Is possible to do this? http://lwn.net/Articles/299483/

Thanks so much in advance.

Really I need help!"
Amazon EC2	"Re: How to improve startup time instance?
There's some overhead time that you, unfortunately, can't do much about.  Sort of like how your home PC sits around counting memory and doing BIOS things before finally hitting GRUB, there's a little bit of overhead while we're creating your machine, connecting all the devices to it and configuring it.  However, if you use EBS-backed AMIs, they will launch faster because we don't have to copy them anywhere, first.

Once the virtual machine starts, you're in the realm of the kernel.  A recompiled kernel that skips useless drivers can cut the launch time quite a bit.  If you don't want to recompile, you still might be able to disable a number of drivers using the command line arguments in grub.conf.

After that, there's the user processes.  Making boot processes run in parallel, and skipping useless ones can save you enormous amounts of time.  Turning off unused services helps.  

Unfortunately, since you can't watch the boot messages scrolling by, it is sort of difficult to see what is taking the time during boot and what is providing the most benefit.  If you have timestamps in the output of 'dmesg', that will help, although they're usually in 'seconds-since-boot' in the early phases, and unix-time for later.  

Some of our community AMIs have been doing a lot of work on minimizing boot times.  In particular, take a look at the Arch Linux AMI.  They've got a minimal system that boots really quickly."

$curl -o /dev/null -s -w %{time_connect}:%{time_starttransfer}:%{time_total}n <your website>
0.189:0.351:0.351

Could you please provide more information about the 'network out' issues to troubleshoot this further?

I hope the above information helps.

Amazon EC2	"Re: Configuring Squirrel mail.
An external mail server would look up your domain name in DNS for an MX record, then connect to the indicated server on port 25.  You will need to ensure that your public MX record is correct and that port 25 is allowed to reach your instance. Then, your instance will need to have a Mail Transfer Agent running that will accept those connections.

Hello,

Thank you for posting.

I took a look at your account ending in: 8463 and I couldn't find the ENI: eni-8b02daef under this account.   

In general, you must first detach an elastic network interface from an instance before you can delete it. Deleting an elastic network interface releases all attributes associated with the interface and releases any private IP addresses or Elastic IP addresses to be used by another instance. Also, you cannot detach a primary network interface from an instance. Therefore, you cannot delete the primary network interface without terminating an instance. 

For more information about 'Deleting an Elastic Network Interface', please refer to this documentation: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html#delete_eni

Underlying hardware issues are unpredictable and not all results in an instance being stuck stopping. It is therefore difficult to quantify how often this issue occurs.

It may be helpful to design for failure by having your instances behind a load balancer, or in an auto-scaling group that can automatically compensate for the failed instance. Additionally, tools such as EC2 Auto-Recovery can be a great help in mitigating failure of instances:

Amazon EC2	"Using D2 instances for permanent storage
Hello, we are currently using M3 instances to run a Riak cluster which we then use to store customer documents.  Our store ends up growing pretty rapidly so we find ourselves adding EBS volumes to the cluster a bit more often than we'd like.  

One thing we were looking at was the use of D2 instances in place of the M3s since they offer so much local storage.  We have concerns around this though since all instances will be located within the Ireland region (albeit in different AZs) and if I am reading correctly, a region wide power outage could cause us to lose all data stored in the cluster permanently as it goes away any time an instance is stopped.  Although we have 3 replicas of any document across the cluster, if we lose all of them, that doesn't do us a lot of good.  If that is the case, it seems that this would not be the ideal instance type for store of customer documents, is that correct?  Any thoughts or insight on the matter would be greatly appreciated."
Amazon EC2	"Re: Using D2 instances for permanent storage
Hi,

If you are storing customer data that isnt easily reproducable, using local (ephemeral) storage is generally a bad idea as like you say, if you lose power or experience any other hardware fault with the instance that causes it to stop, then all data on that instance is lost.  I would highly recommend using EBS Volumes as these provide persistant storage and by default utomatically replicate your data within the same AZ should that volume experience a problem.

Ensure you have your instances spread between the different availability Zones for maximum resiliency.

I would also ensure you are taking regular snapshots of your data which is then backed up to S3 which has a durability of 99.999999999% against data losss.

Also, its hugely unlikely that the whole Region will fail, however with regular snapshot backups and ensuring you have an up to date AMI ready to use then migrating your data to another region will not be an issue.

Amazon EC2	"Re: Where did my instance storage go?
Hello,

I have taken a look at your instance and it doesn't appear that you have added the instance store when launching the instance. 

Unfortunately after you launch the instance you cannot add ephemeral devices (2 X 80 GB SSD). Ephemeral storage can only be configured when an instance is launched. To overcome this issue, you could do the following:

Create a new AMI from this instance and specify the storage device ""instance store volumes"" that you want to be attached to the configuration:

1- Right click on the running EC2 instance.
2- Select Create Image.
3- On the button ""Add New Volume"" select the 2 devices you want to be added and continue with all the other configuration.

More details on how ephemeral storage works: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html

In addition, EBS volumes are persistent across start/stops while ephemeral devices are not.

In response to your questions,

When you launch your instances, they will persist until you manually terminate them. There are however AWS services such as Elastic Beanstalk that are stateless and automatically replaces unhealthy instances. If you take some time to fully understand the service you will be deploying and you deploy your applications following AWS best practice, you will not lose any instances or data.

Amazon EC2	"AWS Signature Version 4 Test Suite Issue
Hi,

I'm currently implementing an application that uses the signature version 4. The provided test suite puzzles me a little, though.
More specifically, my question concerns the format of the 'Date' or 'X-Amz-Date' HTTP header field.

In the documentation, the following is stated: 
""The date header looks for a time stamp and the credential scope looks for an eight-digit string representing the year (YYYY), month (MM), and day (DD) of the request. Requests are rejected if the two dates do not match. For example, if the date header contains the value 20111015T080000Z and the date component of the credential scope is 20111015, AWS allows the authentication process to proceed.""

From live tests I can confirm that Amazon only accepts signed requests with a Date header in that format. Using another format (e.g. RFC 2616) doesn't work.

In the test suite, however, all test cases contain the following Date header:
DATE:Mon, 09 Sep 2011 23:36:00 GMT

So to make the test suite run, I'd need to write code that also accepts this kind of Date header, which in turn is not desirable when actually running the code and generating live AWS signed HTTP requests.

I'd be thankful for some clarification on that matter"

Amazon EC2	"Re: Cannot SSH to linux server after reboot
Hello,

Looking at the output of the SSH connection it appears to me that the key you are sending is ""Trying private key: ECCl"" which does not match what I see instance i-e8e99f12 was launched with. This does not mean that this key is invalid as it could have been renamed or the public key for this private key could have been added after the instance was launched.

As Imthian stated the key that this instance was launched with is ESS_ECC_BPC.

If you believe you've tried a valid key and the correct username then there are a couple of ways to deal with this situation.

Option 1:
Create an AMI of this instance and then launch an instance from the AMI. At launch time specify the key you wish to use. Once the instance has fully booted you should be able to SSH to this instance using the key. If you cannot, then I suspect there is some change within the instance that is blocking access and you'll need to try Option 2.

Option 2:
Stop this instance, which it appears the instance has been stopped, detach the root volume taking note of how the volume is currently attached to the instance (/dev/sda). Attach the volume to an instance you can access (it must be in the same availability zone as this volume), mount the volume and review the logs in /YOUR-MOUNT-POINT/var/log/ for information as to why SSHD is not accepting your login. Typically SSHD will log to secure or auth.log. If you can identify the issue, make the necessary changes. You could also add a new public key to the authorized_keys file that resides in the user's home directory under the .ssh directory. Then revert the steps above, unmount the volume, detach, attach and start the instance.

Kiet"
Amazon EC2	"Re: Cannot SSH to linux server after reboot
Hello,

If you are still unable to access this instance I would recommend launching a replacement instance and then detach the root volume from the 'bad' instance and attach it to the new instance, Option 2 from my previous post. Once attached you can mount the filesystem to the replacement instance and copy any necessary data off of the old volume into the new instance. This of course is not ideal, but you'll have access to all the data that is on the 'bad' instance.

I apologize, but there is no way to access the instance from our end, nor is there any way to SSH to the server without the private key unless you've configured the system to do so. Going forward I would highly recommend that you create frequent Images or Snapshots of your environment and test those. That way if something like this happens and you cannot identify the root cause you can always launch a replacement instance. I typically create a Image before making any configuration changes this way I always have an Image before my edits.

Hi IsaacNK,

I'm in a similar situation, having received a retirement notification just yesterday. I did a complete shutdown and then started my EBS-backed instance, at which point the degraded hardware notice was removed from the ""Scheduled Tasks"" area of my EC2 Management Console. Everything seems good with the server and with the AWS management console.

The reason I'm writing is, I have an automated script that runs a ""ec2-describe-instance-status"" command to check the state of the virtual server, and it's still saying the server is ""Completed The instance is running on degraded hardware"" and is due for ""instance-stop"" on 2015-07-28.

I get the same result when I run the ""aws ec2 describe-instance-status"" command as well.

So, it seems like the CLI interfaces are saying my instance is still due for an ""instance-stop"" event on the 28th, even though the AWS console doesn't show that message anymore? Do you know what could explain the disconnect in the 2 methods (web vs. CLI)? Is there one source that should be trusted as more accurate over the other? I'd prefer not to rebuild my server on a new instance if I don't have to.

Amazon EC2	"Re: What Plan I Should Choose
That is a good question. EC2 is the right choice when you simply need a server where you can install and tinker with some software. The specifications of said server does matter, but the first thing you should consider is the distance between you and the machine. EC2 is available in a number of locations around the world. Your choice of region determines where it will be running. See Global Infrastructure. In the AWS Management Console, you'll find the region selector in the upper right corner. Select your preferred region before launching the instance. But if you want to set up a VPN in the US specifically and happen to be far away, all you can do is select a region on the right coast. Keep in mind that access from EC2 IP ranges may be restricted in some cases. 

Regarding the specifications of the server, the t2.micro may be a good starting point. Use the available metrics to determine if something bigger is needed. As you pay by the hour (for anything outside of the free tier), you can try different instance types without getting a scary bill. In many cases, you can simply stop the instance, change the type, and then start it back up with all data still there."

Amazon EC2	"Instance crashes after a few minutes (every time!)
For some reason every time I set up an instance it crashes after a few minutes...

I do the same thing every time:

1. Create an SSH security group.
2. Create an instance (tried with t2.micro and t2.small ), Amazon Linux. and attach the security group to the instance.
3. Create a key pair and convert it using putty key generator.
4. Connect to the instance using Putty.

And EVERY TIME I do this (even when I bring the instance down and bring it up again and even if I never connect to it), it crashes after a few minutes (2 -3 minutes) and I cant connect to it anymore.

Why does this happen? I only do what I described.

TO MAKE THINGS CLEAR: I do connect to it at first and its working fine but then it crashes. (So its probably not a problem with the SSH security group, the key or something like that).

If you can SSH to this instance over the private IP, a packet capture when you are trying to connect over the public IP would be extremely helpful as this will clearly indicate if the packets are arriving at the instance.

Amazon EC2	"Re: m3.xlarge instance has only 8 GiB storage?
What AMI are you running? What is the output of ""lsblk"" or ""fdisk -l /dev/xvde""?

When you create a new instance, Amazon takes an EBS snapshot of the root filesystem and clones it onto a new EBS volume of the size you requested. However, the snapshot is taken at a block level. So even if you have a 128GB disk, it contains a partition table and a filesystem that are sized to 8GB.

When you run a standard AMI like Amazon Linux or Ubuntu, one of the things that happens the first time an instance boots is that it detects the size of its disk, and resizes its root partition to use all of the available space. Normally, this is handled by the preinstalled ""cloud-init"" tools. (There's no ""someone at AWS"" involved; it's an entirely automatic process.) 

It sounds like either your AMI isn't properly configured to run cloud-init, or it somehow failed to resize its root partition. Check the logs from when your instance was first started. If you're feeling brave and have good backups, it's possible to manually resize the root partition while the instance is running."

Amazon EC2	"Re: m3.xlarge instance has only 8 GiB storage?
Hello,

The disk image on your instance is partitioned. cloud-init is unable to resize the filesystem without the partition being resized first. On systems where this works as you expected, it's done by some scripts in the ramdisk. It looks like CentOS 6 ships with cloud-init, but without the scripts to resize the root partition. Resizing the root partition can be tricky and dangerous to do manually, so we don't recommend it. You might supply extra space to your instance by attaching a separate volume and formatting and mounting that instead. Or you might try one of the other operating systems available on EC2.

I hope this explanation is helpful to you.

Best Regards,
Andrew"
Amazon EC2	"Re: m3.xlarge instance has only 8 GiB storage?
Hello,

Taking Andrew's points into consideration, if you would still like to resize the partition, you can follow our documentation found here:

Amazon EC2	"Re: m3.xlarge instance has only 8 GiB storage?
Thanks, AndrewJ and JustinG for your responses.

As I understand it, even though CentOS has the cloud-init scripts installed, it was unable to resize the root partition due to some missing scripts on the RAMdisk. That seems to explain the issue, but it doesn't explain why our other CentOS based instances don't have this problem. 

We're going to work on a solution and will report back once we have it solved. In the meantime, when I brought up another instance based on a snapshot of this CentOS instance, it also had only an 8 GiB root partition, so it seems like the partition issue is ""baked in"" to the snapshot."

In general, a connection refused message comes directly from the Operating System not accepting the TCP connection, and instead sends a TCP RST packet back to the requesting, signalling that the connection is closed.

Typically this can happen if your operating system does not have any application running and listening on that specific port.

The first thing I would check is that your application is listening on Port 5223:

sudo netstat -tunlp | grep 5223

If nothing is returned, you application is not listening on that port."

Hey Guys, 

Have an issue with defining the security group for an instance 'A' running CoreOS with service running inside a docker container exposing ports 9092 and 2181. 

These ports will be accessed via its public static IP by services running in its own containers on another CoreOS EC2 instance 'B'. These instances are NOT within the same VPC and are deployed under the EC2 classic mode. 

If we enable access to 'A' for everyone then things work fine for services in instance 'B'. However when we try to restrict access to specific IP ranges for the traffic that originates from B we loose access to 'A'. 

Can provide more info on the specific AWS resources upon further request. Any help would be appreciated here.

Hi,

You could introduce ClassicLink - Information here:  https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/classiclink-private-communication-between-classic-ec2-instances-vpc-resources/

It enables you to put your Classic instances into your VPC security groups allowing tighter security between your VPC and Classic environment and hopefully should resolve your problem.

Normally building a Ubuntu server it's very quick.  I'm either using the micro or small instance.  However, all of Tuesday/Thursday this week (regardless of how many instances I try to spin up) the install process with apt-get is shockingly slow.

I have built a mail server using mailenable and can successfully receive emails. Unfortunately, I cannot seem to send e-mails... my test app says the email has been sent but they do not seem to go anywhere. I am assuming I will receive mail undelivered messages soon.

-I have created the relevant security groups to allow inbound/outbound access for port 25
-I've created the relevant rules in Windows Firewall as well.
-I have sent the Amazon form asking for permission to send emails which they have granted.

One thing I haven't done is provide Amazon with the reverse DNS records - do I need to do this? What do I need to provide?

Other than that I am pretty stuck with this. I have another dedicated server with another hosting company and it works fine with pretty much the same setup, I'm thinking it's something to do with Amazon's firewall/servers?

Yes, you need to provide reverse DNS for the EIP addresses as specified in the application form to remove these restrictions.
The Reverse DNS name should be identical to the DNS name as advertised in the mailserver when it sends out the EHLO/HELO command.
So if your mailservers advertises mail.mydomain.com then you should have them create a Reverse DNS mail.mydomein.com for the EIP address of your instance."

Amazon EC2	"Re: Severe Packet Loss to Oregon Regions
Hello, 

Are you still experiencing this issue? 

A few things I noticed on your MTR:
1. Your MTR is to two different IPs. 
2. Neither of them show any packet loss to the target node (54.69.12.103 or 54.191.225.113), only some packet loss at the intermediary hop which as you stated earlier, is due to ICMP deprioritization. 
3. 15ms is very healthy, and shouldn't lead to 5-15 second load times. 

If you're still having reports of issues, it may be worthwhile to leave a ping or MTR up for a significant period of time to verify if any packet loss is seen. Packet loss to a single hop in the middle is not indicative of a problem. Packet loss to a single node in the middle indicates that node is deprioritizing replying to ICMP, and you'll notice every hop past that doesn't show any packet loss at all.

Amazon EC2	"Questionable AWS Reliability
To my horror, I received an email communication for my AWS Account 629716523433 that my C4 Large instance i-6996c899 is unreachable and it will be stopped or terminated by 28-July. It was horrific because when I received the email, I had only 2 hours before an important business meeting on which revenue of around $20,000 was riding. Not a small amount of money for an Indian start-up like ours. Important meeting because it included L&D Head of one of Big 3 Indian IT companies.

Thankfully, I was not in a flight and my techie was also available and we could start a new instance in flat 22 minutes. But thats what made me thinking about reliability of AWS. I have been having a good time since shifting from GoDaddy since end of March 2015, since AWS machine is really more powerful. But in my 2 years of stay with GoDaddy, I didnt had such an unreliable moment.

What would have happened if I missed the message or was not around to take it? What if my techie was not available? While AWS is good in promptly sending the message and even better in having a system wherein a new instance can be setup in ligthening quick time. May I know if this all that AWS can do on the reliability front? While I understand that physical infrastructure can be unreliable, why cannot AWS do the following to prevent instances of mental torture for the customers-

(a) Enable sending of instance failure email & sms to several email addresses / mobile and not just the owner.

(b) Enable a system wherein a similar instance is automatically created for the damaged instance and EBS and elastic ip (if any) gets automatically attached to new instance. I required this much; others may require more options

I would like to add that mine is a global-audience start-up, which means it is frequented 24*7*365 and because it is a start-up, we cannot have a 24*7*365 techie watchman. Perhaps, being at AWS may increase our cost as it is forcing us to have one.

And this is not an isolated incident. My friend in another start-up faced the very same issue 6 days back! He didnt raise it with you since it was his testing server. But I have implored him to raise it with you, so that AWS, a supposedly customer-centric company, improves its reliability quotient; it is definitely lacking currently."
Amazon EC2	"Re: Questionable AWS Reliability
First of all, you are in the ECS forum which is for the EC2 Container Service, a specific service that is unrelated to your issue.

What you're describing is a natural consequence of cloud computing. You need to architect for failure. EC2 is not to be treated as a standard colocation provider, otherwise you're in for some pain. Typically the standard way to handle such a scenario is to create an Auto-Scaling Group of minimum size 1 and maximum size 1, and set up the group to spin up a new instance if the old one fails. You would use the corresponding launch configuration to automatically configure the machine upon instantiation. Here is the getting started documentation for auto-scaling:

I'm having issues forcing HTTPS with a site that I'm deploying through AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

I've come to the conclusion (still not sure if this is right) that it is not within EBS that I force HTTPS. I'm allowing both HTTP and HTTPS through my EBS Load Balancer, and am attempting to redirect on the server. I have tried variations of this, such as only allowing HTTPS traffic through EBS, but that does not redirect.

This is where I'm running into problems. I'm finding many answers about rewrite rules without mod_rewrite which are based around the X-Forwarded-Proto Header, but that file does not exist on my EC2 machine according to a find search.

I'm using EB CLI and I've also tried creating a config file within the .ebextensions directory, but that did not work either.

Hello,

Upon reviewing your EBS snapshot snap-7e2c7cef, I can see the current progress is at 68%. Please allow a few more hours for completion. 

The time to create an EBS snapshot is based on the number of changed blocks since the last snapshot. A few small changes would result in a very quick snapshot creation, many changes would require more time to capture on a snapshot. It would take a longer time if this is the first EBS snapshot of the EBS volume you are snapshotting.

Amazon EC2	"Re: EC2 with Multipul EIP's
Hello,

The reason why you are not able to connect to one Elastic IP is due to the assymetric routing issues. You will have to do some manual configuration in your instance level to make it work. This is documented here.

Other option is to add an additional IP to your existing ENI (eth0) and attach an additional Elastic IP to the same interface. The number of supported IP addresses varies by instance type. Consult the Elastic Network Interfaces documentation to see how many addresses are supported by the instance types that you use. Depending on your use case, you may also need to configure your EC2 network interfaces to avoid asymetric routing. In Amazon Linux, the package ec2-net-utils will this issue.

Amazon EC2	"EC2 Instance Just... Stopped
Hi,

I have an EC2 instance that doesn't want to do anything (serve web pages, SSH, stop or start). However, if I create a snapshot, then AMI, then copy from that instance, the copied instance seems to work fine. Any suggestions what might be happening?

Details as follows.

Just had a problem with an EC2 instance that I don't understand.

The first we knew of the problem was when our EC2 instance (i-df23ba10) stopped serving web pages.

So, I tried to login to the instance via SSH terminal, but the the system didn't respond.

Then, I tried rebooting instance via Amazon Console. Nothing happened.

So, I tried to stop the instance. The state turned to stopping but seemed to hang there, it didn't actually stop.

Since the instance serves a dozen production sites I didn't want the server down for an extended period. So, I created an AMI and then copy of the instance from our daily backups and switched the Elastic IP to that.

Once the crisis was over, I created a snapshot, an AMI, then a Test instance from the original (i-df23ba10) hung instance. That test instance seemed to run fine although, I had trouble stopping it too.

Then, I discovered I could right click on the original instance in Amazon console and ""Forcefully Stop"". That worked. However, when I tried to start the original instance (i-df23ba10), it just hung.

I've had a look at some of the OS logs, but don't see any red flags there.

Any suggestions on why or how to fix or how to stop happening again?

Thanks

Amazon EC2	"EC2 Instance Status Check Failed - No logs available to know why
Hi, 

This morning one of our production EC2 instances(i-8f0d7862) was unreachable. When I logged into AWS it showed that it had failed both system status and instance status check. I have attached a screenshot for reference.
I had to stop (the stop action took some time which was unusual) and start the server through AWS. The server did come back up online after that. I went into the Server logs but there is no logs out there indicating why the server was unreachable. 
Am i missing something here? Is there any way to identify what went wrong? Please let me know, any support would be appreciated. 

Thanks,
Jai"
Amazon EC2	"Re: EC2 Instance Status Check Failed - No logs available to know why
Hi there Jai,

I have looked at the history of this instance and I can advise that the issue that you are talking about occurred while the underlying infrastructure that the instance was running on was having an issue.

When you have these issues the first step of stopping and starting the instance will move it to healthy underlying infrastructure. When it takes some time for the instance to stop as it did in your case that is usually an indication that there might be an issue with the infrastructure that the instance is running on.

For the future you can create a support case if your instance in failing these health checks for longer than 20 minutes with the below information

https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/faqs/#sfhc20

If it suits your use case you can also create an alarm to perform an action for you

Amazon EC2	"Can't connect to Ubuntu EC2 instance after running out of memory
I am running an EC2 Ubuntu instance on AWS and have been able to SSH into it perfectly ever since it was launched in early June. 

About a half hour ago, a process running caused the server to run out of memory (A person in my group was working on the server and notified me of this. I was unable to ssh into it after they told me about it). I rebooted the server and am still unable to ping or ssh into the server. Whenever I try one of these, the connection times out. The instance ID of this server is i-f94e6429.

I know it isn't anything with the security groups since myself and my friend in my group has been able to ssh into it many times before and even earlier today. I feel like it's just stuck or something because of the memory running out but I don't know how to solve this issue.

Any help on this would be greatly appreciated.

Amazon EC2	"Unable to connect via other networks
Hi,

I have been attempting to allow others to connect via RDP to my EC2 instances, but I can't seem to allow access. From my network where I work I am able to ping, RDP, etc. As a troubleshooting step I tried allowing ICMP from anywhere in my security groups, but I still cannot even ping my instances from other networks. I am a bit confused, as I do not see my network at work defined anywhere, and the VPC rules are allowing traffic from 0.0.0.0/0.

I have not ruled out the possibility of firewalls being the cause of my issues, but I have no way to verify that currently. I would like to be sure I have done everything on my end before reaching out to others.

Thanks in advance."
Amazon EC2	"Re: Unable to connect via other networks
Hello,

I took a look at your account and could see that you have both Windows and Linux instances.
As per the security group assigned to all your EC2 instances, it accept ICMP ping from all source (0.0.0.0/0). I did try to ping to your instances and was able able to get a reply back.  Opening your instances publicly especially for ICMP is not a recommended approach. So, I would recommend you to close this down once your testing is over.

Also, I noticed that none of the windows instance's security group are allowing ingress connection on RDP port 3389. You will have to allow ingress connection on TCP port 3389 from your trusted sources to get connected via RDP. Similarly, for Linux instances, you may have to enable ingress port 22 for SSH access.

Amazon EC2	"Re: Unable to connect via other networks
Thank you for the reply.

I made a hasty assumption when I was working on this last week, as a colleague could not connect via RDP and neither could I from a different network. It turned out that the network I was attempting to connect from had some apparent firewall policies blocking my access (and I'm guessing my colleague also was being blocked by a firewall). I created a security rule allowing access from my phone's 4g address and I was able to connect. That at least confirmed that I was performing the correct steps to allow access.

I'm a bit confused by the second half of your reply. Not only does it appear to me that ingress connections on port 3389 are allowed, but I have been connecting to those instances without an issue from my work's network. Alas, I seem to have discovered my problem is not my EC2 settings."

Amazon EC2	"Permission denied (publickey). Again.
Hello!
I know, that on this forum or in the Net a lot of topics with same problem and many solutions. But I guess, my case is strange.
For all actions I used Putty. My local os is Windows and on the server - Amazon Linux.

I've been using ec2 since April under ec2-user. In last Saturday I created two users for developers without permissions for sudo, it's important. Now they are working well. After that I logged out of ec2-user.
Sunday morning, I tried to log in as ec2-user and had an error: 
Permission denied (publickey).

Okay, I tried to use ssh command from MinGW. I had same error.
I thought, maybe when I was creating new users, I accidentally killed a ec2-user's authorized_keys file.
I decided to regain access to this user to use manual. I launched new instance with current key pair (because I know old private key), mounted a volume from old instance and copied authorized_keys (with old public key) to /mnt/tempvol/home/ec2-user/.ssh/authorized_keys etc.
I tried to connect to my old instance and I had error again. But few minutes ago I used these private and public keys for connection with new instance.
After that I used manual again and created (by ssh-keygen) new public and private keys for ec2-user. This time I temporarily set  777 permissions to .ssh/authorized_keys and now I can change keys without replace instances. It didn't work too.

Amazon EC2	"Re: Permission denied (publickey). Again.
I did it.
I set all permissions for other user on ec2-user home directory. It was the main reason of trouble. sshd(8) doesn't like it.

From sshd(8) man page:
~/.ssh/authorized_keys
Lists the public keys (DSA, ECDSA, Ed25519, RSA) that can be used for logging in as this user. The format of this file is described above. The content of the file is not highly sensitive, but the recommended permissions are read/write for the user, and not accessible by others.
 
If this file, the ~/.ssh directory, or the user's home directory are writable by other users, then the file could be modified or replaced by unauthorized users. In this case, sshd will not allow it to be used unless the StrictModes option has been set to “no”."

I assume that you are referring to your instance i-e192a62d. I did check it's Network ACLs, Security Group etc and they all look fine. Can you try stopping and starting your instance and see if you are login as root user. If the issue still exists, I would think that some of the start up configuration which is supposed to run while launching a new instance would have failed. For example tasks like setting up the public key in the authorized_keys file and setting correct permissions etc. You can a new replacement instance if this instance is a fresh instance and do not have any of your data. If this data has some data, then you can consider creating an AMI of your existing instance and launch a new instance using that newly created ami.

Hi there, 

With dedicated as well as shared tenancy there is a small chance that the instances will be stuck in the stopping state, if the host is experiencing difficulties and you are attempting to move to a new healthy underlying host. 

Looking a the underlying host of the instances, I can confirm that it was experiencing difficulties which impacted the instances in the stopping state. You can attempt a force stop by attempting the ""Stop"" action again, however if that does not successfully stop the instances you will need to contact AWS support by creating a case, or through the forums here and we can then take a look at the Underlying host for you.

Amazon EC2	"Re: Connection Refused
Hi,

I took a look at the instance. I see now it is giving a ""Connection refused"" error when testing it on SSH, HTTP, HTTPS and other ports. 

There should be something wrong with the instance at OS level but from our end we do not have visibility of the instance OS operations. You mentioned that you restarted several times but this didnt help. Did you try doing a stop/start?

You might need to try these:

1) Create an AMI of the instance and launch a new one to see if it has the same problem
2) Stop the instance, detach the root volume, attach it to a working instance (and mount it in the OS). Then check the OS / SSH log files on the volume in an effort to determine if there are any problems with SSH. This will also allow you to check your SSH configuration files and other application logs files.

Note: Before performing any changes to your instance, we would recommend backing up your EBS volume(s). You can do this using EBS snapshots: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSSnapshots.html

Also, please keep in mind that the second troubleshooting option will require you to stop the instance, which can have various effects. Please see the following documentation for full information: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Stop_Start.html

It sounds like KeepAlives for PuTTY isn't configured. As such the network connecting is closing after a period of inactivity.

An example for setting up KeepAlives within PuTTY:

1.) Open the PuTTy application and navigate to the Options panel.
2.) Select Connection
3.) In the field Sending null packets to keep session active change the default value from 0 to
60
5.) Check the Enable TCP keepalives (SO_KEEPALIVE option) check box.

Amazon EC2	"Re: Unable To Enable Hardware Acceleration on Windows Server 2012 g2 Instances
Hi there vexellon,

Most of the issues that I come across where the hardware GPU functions are not available comes down to the client that you are using to connect to the instance. The most common being the regular Windows RDP client. When connections are made to the instance using this client it uses a software display driver making the GPU inaccessible.

What I would recommend is to change the way that you are connecting to the instance using something that does support hardware acceleration, such examples are VNC and TeamViewer.

Once you are connected to the instance using a hardware accelerated client then you should be able to use the full hardware GPU capabilities."

Amazon EC2	"OpenGL hardware acceleration on a G2 instance?
I have a rendering application, written in C++/OpenGL, that I'm trying to launch on a g2.2xlarge instance, but with every approach that I've tried, the only available display device uses software emulation of OpenGL 1.1.  Unless specified below, these tests were run on Windows Server 2012.  Here's a summary of my dead ends:

Remote Desktop: The only available display device (RDPUDD Chained DD) uses software emulation of OpenGL 1.1.  In Windows Server 2008 R2, there are 3 equally useless display devices (RDPDD Chained DD, RDP Encoder Mirror Driver, RDP Reflector Display Driver).

RemoteFX: Enabled this feature (which is supposed to allow GPU access via Remote Desktop) on a Windows Server 2008 RC2 instance.  It had no effect on the available display devices.  According to the documentation for RemoteFX for Windows Server 2012, support for VMX -- hardware-assisted virtualization -- is required.  Unfortunately, coreinfo.exe reports that this hardware feature is unavailable.

VNC Server installed via Remote Desktop: Same as above and only accessible with the VNC Viewer when  the Remote Desktop is also running.

SSH with Cygwin: No display devices available at all.

Auto launch on reboot from startup folder: This offered a different display device (Microsoft Basic Display Adapter), but it still appears to use software emulation and doesn't support OpenGL 4.

Windows PowerShell: I tested this by creating a localhost session on the server (Enter-PSSession -ComputerName localhost).  No display devices available at all.

Are there other ways of connecting that I haven't considered?  Could it really be possible that you can't run a hardware-accelerated OpenGL applications on these instances?  Isn't that the entire point?

It sounds as though you have a couple of steps that you might need to check.  Take a look at the below steps when troubleshooting connectivity to your instances:

1. Ensure the correct ports in the Security Group are open that is associated with your instance (which you have already done!)
2. Ensure the NACL associated with your subnet that the instance resided in have the relevant ports open
3. Ensure you have an Internet Gateway set up
4. Ensure your IGW (Internet Gateway) is associated with your VPC

Amazon EC2	"Failing Hardware Trumps Maintenance?
Hi Folks:

On 23 June I got an email from Amazon that said, in part:
""One or more of your Amazon EC2 instances is scheduled for maintenance on 2015-07-12 for 2 hours starting at 07:00 UTC. During this time, the following instances in the us-east-1 region will be unavailable and then rebooted:""

Looking at the email and the instance name, it did, indeed, have something to do with my instance.

On 8 July I got an email from Amazon that said, in part:
""EC2 has detected degradation of the underlying hardware hosting one or more of your Amazon EC2 instances in the us-east-1 region. Due to this degradation, your instance(s) could already be unreachable. Running instances will be stopped or terminated after 12:00AM UTC on 2015-07-24.""

Both messages say:
""You can see more information on your instances that are scheduled for retirement in the AWS Management Console (https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1#Events)""

When I go to this link it says that my instance is scheduled to stop NOT on 12 July, but on 24 July.

Does this mean they are no longer doing the maint. on 12 July and the maint. on 24 July has overridden it?

Hi Dan,

This is most likely your problem. You'll need to stop your instance and detach the root volume and mount it to another instance. From here you can generate new keys and replace them as needed.

Hi Dan,

The reason for that error is because the original root volume for the ""sacrificial"" is still detached. You'll need to re-attach the root volume using /dev/xvda as the device id when it asks for it. For reference the volume id should be vol-df591a2a, as this is the original root volume for ""sacrificial"".

Can you confirm if you took the necessary steps to generate a new key and replace said public key in your ~/ec2-user/.ssh/authorized_keys on vol-df591a2a while also downloading the new private key to work in conjunction with your new public key?

The process for said task can be found here - Generate new EC2 Keys

If you look at the CloudWatch CPU metrics for your instance you will see this is the case: https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=ap-southeast-1#metrics:graph=!NS0!MN1!ST2!ET3!SS4!PD5!D06!E07!VAAWS/EC2~CPUUtilization~2015-07-10T00%3A23%3A06Z~2015-07-11T00%3A23%3A06Z~Maximum~60~InstanceId~i-d5e7f780

I strongly suggest you look into using Auto-Scaling to handle the increases in load during these busy periods.  More information on Auto Scaling can be found here: http://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/

If you have any further problems please let me know.

Hello Manuel, 

Looking at the System Log you have attached I can see towards the bottom a Kernel Panic just under the line 'Begin: Running /scripts/init-bottom ... done'

To edit and debug this script it is possible to detach the root volume of this instance and attach it to another fresh instance under a different mount point.  This will allow you to inspect or disable the scripts that you have mentioned, as well as having access to any additional logging to help debug your code.

The high level steps to achieve this are: 
1. Launch a Debug Linux Instance under the same region and Availability Zone 
1a. Be sure to note down the instance-id's and volume-id's of your instances 
2. Stop (do not terminate) your broken instance 
3. Detach the root volume of the broken instance 
4. Attach this volume to your Debug Instance under /dev/sdf 
5. Mount the volume under a mount point of your choosing on the Debug Instance (sudo mount /dev/xvdf /mnt/oldDrive) 

Once these steps are done, you will have access to all your files and can edit/tweak them as necessary. You can then reattach this volume back to the original instance.

I have included some documentation that goes into greater detail:  https://aws.amazon.com/articles/5213606968661598 (reading from 'Start a Debug Linux Instance')

Amazon EC2	"Re: ELB 504 ERRORS
Hi,

The ELB service is designed to autoscale by itself as demand increases, ELB will provision itself to handle new loads and to communicate with additional EC2 instances behind it.  

However note:
When you create an elastic load balancer, a default level of capacity is allocated and configured. As Elastic Load Balancing sees changes in the traffic profile, it will scale up or down. The time required for Elastic Load Balancing to scale can range from 1 to 7 minutes, depending on the changes in the traffic profile. When Elastic Load Balancing scales, it updates the DNS record with the new list of IP addresses. To ensure that clients are taking advantage of the increased capacity, Elastic Load Balancing uses a TTL setting on the DNS record of 60 seconds. It is critical that you factor this changing DNS record into your tests. If you do not ensure that DNS is re-resolved or use multiple test clients to simulate increased load, the test may continue to hit a single IP address when Elastic Load Balancing has actually allocated many more IP addresses. Because your end users will not all be resolving to that single IP address, your test will not be a realistic sampling of real-world behavior.

Source of this where you can find more information on how ELB manages scale etc is found here:
http://aws.amazon.com/articles/1636185810492479

Ubuntu, by default, doesn't detect multiple IP addresses associated with a single network interface. In order to have multiple IP addresses assigned to the network interface, you can add the following lines to the 'interfaces' file under /etc/network/ directory on your Ubuntu instance:

Amazon EC2	"sporadic network errors in EC2 instance (localhost <--> localhost)
Background:

I run trading simulations inside AWS EC2-classic instances.

On each AWS instance, I start 2 separate Java programs--call them A and B--that communicate with each other using ordinary TCP sockets.

Since both these programs are on the same (AWS virtual) machine, the sockets always use localhost for the IP address host name.  Program A creates a server socket at localhost on port number 12300, and waits for program B to create a client socket connection to localhost:12300.  After an initial connection on that port, some information is exchanged between A and B, and further localhost socket connections between them will be made on a few subsequent port numbers (e.g. 12301, 12302, etc).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem:

Sometimes my simulations work perfectly, other times they soon fail due to networking errors.

The most common networking error that I see is with that initial socket connection.  From my logs, I know that A successfully created a server socket on localhost:12300, and that B repeatedly tried to establish a client socket with it, but that B's attempts all failed.  The fundamental networking error seen by B is
	java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused
		at java.net.PlainSocketImpl.socketConnect(Native Method) ~[na:1.7.0_67]
		at java.net.AbstractPlainSocketImpl.doConnect(AbstractPlainSocketImpl.java:339) ~[na:1.7.0_67]

		at java.net.Socket.<init>(Socket.java:208) ~[na:1.7.0_67]
		...

Sometimes, that initial localhost:12300 connection succeeds, but then one of the subsequent socket connections fails.  Last night, I saw a connection to port 12302 fail with that same
	java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused

Also, even before programs A and B attempt to communicate, B first downloads some configuration data from a MySQL database.  Last night, for the first time ever, I saw one of my simulations fail because of this networking error:

Some more information:

1) whether or not a given simulation fails is somewhat random

2) that said, certain times of day (evenings, Friday evenings especially) seem to be especially hazardous
	--anyone know if AWS is particularly busy with jobs at that time?
	--does AWS do system maintenance on Friday evenings?

3) if a simulation attempt failed, I can often get it to work simply by retrying it one or more times
	--I re-execute the exact same command that previously failed
	--the fact that it subsequently works indicates that there is nothing wrong with my code, but is an AWS issue
	--further proof that AWS is to blame: I have never seen any networking errors when I run my simulations on my personal workstation

4) I run each simulation on a newly created AWS instance (more details below)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Security Group (probably not the cause):

I initially created a new security group using the AWS CLI, and added these ingress rules:
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-name <MySecurityGroupName>
 --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr <CompanyPublicIp#1>32
 
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-name <MySecurityGroupName> --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr <CompanyPublicIp#2>/32
 
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-name <MySecurityGroupName> --protocol tcp --port 3306 --cidr <CompanyPublicIp#1>/32
 
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-name <MySecurityGroupName> --protocol tcp --port 3306 --cidr <CompanyPublicIp#2>/32

The egress rules are the default (allow all outbound connections).

I have a hard time believing that my security group could cause the network problems described above, because it should always cause a problem, instead of cause sporadic problems, right?

That said, I tried adding this ingress rule to allow every inbound connection to localhost (127.0.0.1):
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-name FxSimSecurityGroup --protocol all --port -1 --cidr 127.0.0.1/32

(An analogous egress rule for VPC security groups is described at the end of this link)

This new localhost ingress rule had no effect, as expected.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

AWS instance initialization (probably not the cause):

I mentioned above that each simulation runs in a newly created EC2-classic instance.

You might be thinking that maybe I am running my simulations too soon after instance creation, and therefore that certain stuff like networking on the virtual machine is not fully ready.

While this may turn out to be the explanation, note that before I start running a simulation, I first do these checks (in the order listed) to try to establish that the instance is ready:

1) I poll until I can confirm that instanceId has propagated thru the AWS system
	--I do this with the AWS CLI by calling ""aws ec2 describe-instances  --instance-ids $instanceId"" until the exit code is 0

2) I confirm Monitoring.State is enabled
	--I do this with the AWS CLI by calling ""aws ec2 monitor-instances  --instance-ids $instanceId"" with a query that gets me the Monitoring.State value
	--I wait till it has the value ""enabled""

3) I confirm SystemStatus.Status is ok
	--I do this with the AWS CLI by calling ""aws ec2 describe-instance-status  --instance-ids $instanceId"" with a query that gets me the SystemStatus.Status value
	--I wait till it has the value ""ok""

4) I confirm InstanceStatus.Status is ok
	--I do this with the AWS CLI by calling ""aws ec2 describe-instance-status  --instance-ids $instanceId"" with a query that gets me the InstanceStatus.Status value
	--I wait till it has the value ""ok""

Note that 4) is especially relevant to this current issue: my understanding from this link is that once I see the instance status check pass, then it
	""confirms that we AWS are able to deliver network packets to the operating system hosted on your instance.""

Is there any further check that I should do to confirm that my instance is ready?

To aid diagnosis, I am attaching a file to this message which contains the output of running ""aws ec2 describe-instances  --instance-ids $instanceId"" after all the checks above have passed.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So what is the cause of these networking errors?

Sporadic failures like this are extremely frustrating to deal with!"
Amazon EC2	"Re: sporadic network errors in EC2 instance (localhost <--> localhost)
How many times does the client (B) retry the connection if it fails, and how long does it wait in between each retry? If it works sometimes but not others it sounds like it could be caused by a race condition where the client (B) starts and retries even before the server (A) has set up the socket, whereas, other times A properly starts before B and the connection succeeds.

Are both A and B started automatically, or manually by you? If you can start them manually then I'd try starting A, waiting a few seconds (or more, depending on how long it takes for it to set up the socket), then starting B. Do this a few times to make sure it connects consistently. If that works consistently then the issue above is likely the cause. In that case, modifying your retry settings would help so that it 1) waits longer in between each retry, 2) retries more times, 3) Waits a specified amount of time before trying to connect to A, etc.

Also, how many connections are you making? Could you be exhausting the connection limit or max open files?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: sporadic network errors in EC2 instance (localhost <--> localhost)
theartoflogic: thanks for your response.

How many times does the client (B) retry the connection if it fails, and how long does it wait in between each retry?

Client B tries to connect with A.  If the socket connection fails, then it sleeps for 1 second before a retry.  If more than 100 seconds have elapsed without success, then it assumes that the situation is hopeless, and throws an Exception (that is what crashes my simulation).

If it works sometimes but not others

Let me be more detailed here.

For a given AWS instance, sometimes the first time that I try a simulation it immediately works, and sometimes that simulation fails.

If a simulation fails (for the most common cause described in my initial post), it only fails after ~100 socket connection attempts within that original process all failed, as explained above.

Now if a simulation failed, I can then re-execute the command that I last used to run the simulation, and often this time the simulation immediately works. It looks like B is immediately able to connect with A this time.

it sounds like it could be caused by a race condition where the client (B) starts and retries even before the server (A) has set up the socket,

From log file time stamps, A seems to always have its server socket created before B's first attempt.  (I expect this.)

But even if the first attempt by B happened before A had set up the server socket, I am sure that by 100 seconds later A has.  So, this cannot be the explanation.

Are both A and B started automatically

A bash script starts A first, then immediately starts B.

The connection retry logic and long (100 s) time allowed mean that there should be no need to do things like start A, wait a few seconds, and then start B.  (I used to do that, and hated it as a hack.)

Also, how many connections are you making? Could you be exhausting the connection limit or max open files?

The total number of sockets opened between A and B in a successful simulation is about 11.  Please, there are some other processes going on that use sockets (e.g. MySQL).

I highly doubt that I am hitting any kind of connection number limit, but by all means please educate me.  Maybe AWS imposes some very tight constraints?

But, like security group rules, I have a hard time believing that connection limits are an issue, because they should not cause sporadic problems like this, but either always work or always fail.

I want to update the time of day effect that I mentioned in my original post.  When I tried doing test simulations this morning to investigate the network failures, I was not seeing them all morning!  Then, the last attempt that I did this afternoon had 1 out of 10 simulations fail.  I bet that I see more as the afternoon goes by..."
Amazon EC2	"Re: sporadic network errors in EC2 instance (localhost <--> localhost)
Thanks for the additional info. Hmm, that's definitely an interesting problem. Your retry logic sounds fine, and 100 seconds should be plenty of time to wait for A to start.

In your initial post you say:

From my logs, I know that A successfully created a server socket on localhost:12300, and that B repeatedly tried to establish a client socket with it, but that B's attempts all failed.


Have you tried verifying manually (besides looking at your logs) that A really is listening on the IP/port that B is trying to connect to in those times when it fails (do a `netstat -an | grep 12300` or something)? Maybe A is crashing sometimes, making it so B can't connect, whereas, other times it doesn't crash."

Funny that you asked.

I had come across this aws forum posting yesterday.  I have been meaning to implement its suggestion and call stuff like netstat to see what ports really are being used.

I am sure that the networking bug is something particular to AWS, since I never see it in simulations run on non-AWS machines.

My guess is that either the new AWS instance is not fully initialized, in spite of all the checks that I test for, or else sometimes the network interface that gets used is different.  In particular, maybe A's server socket is not created on localhost but on some other IP address.  (AWS instances seem to have a bunch of different IP addresses, like public and private)

Stay tuned..."
Amazon EC2	"Re: sporadic network errors in EC2 instance (localhost <--> localhost)
I can't tell you the results of running ifconfig, netstat -l, and traceroute localhost because as of about an hour ago, every time that I try to create AWS instances, they all almost immediately die.

For example, just now, I ran a bash script on my local machine that started 10 AWS instances.  With the first one, it passed the first check that I described in my initial post (poll until I can confirm that instanceId has propagated thru the AWS system).  When my local bash script attempted to proceed to the second check (confirm Monitoring.State is enabled), every call to ""aws ec2 monitor-instances --instance-ids $instanceId"" had this error message print out:

""A client error (InvalidState) occurred when calling the MonitorInstances operation: Instance i-9e9b454d not in a monitorable state.""

When I looked about 30-60 seconds later in the AWS web GUI (EC2, Instances), I saw that all 10 of my AWS instances were terminated.

How the heck did this happen?  Certainly not by me!

Is this the dreaded ""Friday evening AWS goes all to hell"" phenomena that I noted in my initial post?

Anyone from AWS support listening?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: sporadic network errors in EC2 instance (localhost <--> localhost)
For the benefit of anyone following this issue: the instances all immediately dying problem that I last reported turned out to be due to a different bug that suddenly kicked in last Friday.  I was unaware that the AMI that I was handed was configured to NOT delete an instance's associated Volume upon instance termination.  That led to a huge pileup of Volumes that eventually triggered a SDD quota error, which forbid me from creating new instances.  I have solved that issue now.

The original networking being flaky on startup bug described above remains...

Amazon EC2	"Re: sporadic network errors in EC2 instance (localhost <--> localhost)
This is bizarre indeed, thank you for the very detailed write up as this is interesting to me.

I feel that maybe the networking stack is getting reset for some reason(?) by an AWS process after your listener creates the listening socket. This would cause the listening socket to become invalid/unbound - meaning that your client can never connect to it. That shouldn't happen with localhost but we never know...

Could you add some debugging on the listener side? Try shutting down and recreating the listening socket every 10 seconds and see if that fixes things."
Amazon EC2	"Re: sporadic network errors in EC2 instance (localhost <--> localhost)
michaelnixonjp: thanks for your response.

I am sure that the issue is related to some bizarre way that AWS initializes their virtual machines.  I intend today to start adding some network debugging to try and get more information.

Unlike running on real native bare metal, it seems as if my AWS VMs do not get the full resources that they should (e.g. CPU and/or SSD) at start up.  Reason: not only do I see the networking failures detailed above, but even if my simulation starts, I initially see really slow performance in all kinds of computations.  It is as if AWS needs to warm up, and get an idea of what resources your code needs, before it actually gives you your final resources.

Note: I am using normal On-Demand Instances (not spot, dedicated, or reserved).   To be precise, r3.xlarge instances.

Do you know of a good link that explains in detail how the AWS virtualization works?  In particular, of what kind of performance guarantees AWS makes to your instances?

Amazon EC2	"Re: sporadic network errors in EC2 instance (localhost <--> localhost)
I have made progress diagnosing this issue by carefully examining time stamps in my log files.

It turns out that the failed networking was a symptom, not the cause.  Networking is actually working fine on my AWS instances.

Instead, the cause has been narrowed down to abysmal MySQL performance on AWS.

I mentioned in my initial post that ""B first downloads some configuration data from a MySQL database.""

On my local box, that operation takes ~100 ms.  I had naively assumed that it would be roughly the same on AWS.  But no: on AWS, I now see that it can take many minutes or fail completely.

With my original code, if that MySQL call took > ~3 minutes, a timeout happened in process A which caused it to shut down (which is why when process B finally tried to connect with it, it got that Connection refused error).  Other times, as reported in my initial post, that MySQL call itself dies.

I have adjusted my code so that process A has a much bigger timeout, so it is now more robust.  But this change is no help if the initial MySQL call in process B fails.  Sure, I could also make process B retry the MySQL call in case of failure, but I have decided not to, because if an operation that should take ~100 ms is actually taking 100X longer, than I have all kinds of other problems.

So, why does MySQL perform so abysmally on AWS?  My guess is bad AWS I/O performance.

I am currently interacting with AWS support on this, so hopefully I will nail this down soon, but I just learned some related stuff from them that I want to pass on.

The big surprise to me is learning what I/O hardware my on demand AWS instances are actually using.

I mentioned in my last post that I am using r3.xlarge instances.  From this link you can see that this instance type has ""1 x 80...SSD Storage (GB)"".

I thought that this meant that when I start up a new on demand AWS instance from a stored AMI, that my instance will run on an SSD that is directly attached to whatever physical CPU my virtual machine is being run on.

Nope.  That is not what happens.

Instead, what happens is that my AWS instance is actually created with its Root volume on a 75 GB General Purpose SSD that actually resides on EBS.  So, I am running it from a network drive, not a local drive.  In particular,  the 75 GB General Purpose SSD turns out to have crap baseline I/O performance (e.g. it guarantees only 225 IOPS).  See this link on EBS volume types.

Oh, that ""1 x 80...SSD Storage (GB)"" mentioned above: that IS a direct attached to the CPU SSD (i.e. local instead of network), but to use it, you have to specially mount it as a new volume, and copy whatever data you want over to it.  That is awful, since it makes it really inconvenient to use.  (If not impossible: my operating system, for example, will always be run from the slow EBS root volume, I think?)

What I really want is for my new instance to have its root volume be automatically created on the direct drive from the start.  Anyone know if that is possible?

Amazon EC2	"Re: sporadic network errors in EC2 instance (localhost <--> localhost)
Hi,

It is possible to have your instance start automatically from the instance storage (when deploying from an AMI) however you need to be careful because all data on instance storage is LOST PERMANENTLY if any of the following happens:


Instance stopped and then started (moved to new hardware)
Sudden hardware failure
Instance retirement (this means Amazon detected imminent hardware failure), you will be sent an email in this case and given up to 2 weeks to move your instance to new hardware.


Make sure you create regular snapshots. There is an easier option that I recommend instead but requires a little effort on your side to write a couple of scripts. Have a script in your AMI that runs at boot time when your instance is brand new. This script checks if the instance store has been setup - if not, it partitions it and sets up a swapfile there and also redirects /tmp there. Thsi should give you a significant speedup. Be very careful before putting production data there because of the risk of loss but in some situations it is a very good thing to do.

For example, if you are running an ElasticSearch cluster you can have several machines mirroring shards between each other, and have them all store data on the very fast instance store. If you lose a single instance it does not matter because you can create another and mirror the data back. In addition, you would want to backup to S3.

On your MySQL performance worries, are you using RDS? If you are note there are sometimes DNS resolution problems (just try again in a few seconds to get around it).

Kind regards

Amazon EC2	"Re: can not connect with the remote server instance
Hello,

Thank you for posting.

I took a look at your instance: i-eb5044e3 and found that the instance was launched from the AMI: Windows_Server-2012-R2_RTM-English-64Bit-Base-2014.06.12 and it is failing instance reachability checks. 

Also, on the system logs, I could see the error: 'difficulty detecting PV driver details for console output'. This error is due to a feature in Windows Server 2012 R2 (Plug and Play Cleanup) that scans for and disables inactive system devices every 30 days. Windows is identifying the EC2 network device as inactive and removing it from the system. If this happens, the instance will lose network connectivity after any subsequent reboot. 

For more information about 'Windows Server 2012 R2 (Plug and Play Cleanup) feature', please refer to this link: http://aws.amazon.com/windows/products/ec2/server2012r2/network-drivers/

In order to remediate this issue, please follow the steps below:

Stop the instance
Create a backup (Right click the instance in the AWS Management Console, Select Image, Create Image)
Change the instance type to C3 (any c3)
Start the instance
RDP into the instance
Download the AWS PV upgrader from this link: ec2-downloads-windows.s3.amazonaws.com/Drivers/AWSPVDriverSetup7.2.5.zip
Unzip and run AWSPVDriverSetup7.2.5.msi
The OS will reboot automatically after running the upgrader, and install the driver. During this time the instance will be unavailable (5-15 minutes). Once complete, the instance will again be accessible.
Verify driver has been installed by checking device manager and under storage controllers look for AWS PV Storage Host Adapter and check the driver properties and make sure the version is 7.2.5.1
Stop the instance
Change instance type back to the original instance type
Start the instance, login, and use as needed

Hi all,

I'm trying to upgrade ssh on default Amazon Ubuntu t2 micro instances, which use ssh 6.6.1p1. In order to pass PCI compliance, ssh needs to report v6.7 or higher, otherwise Trustwave scans fail PCI compliance.

This is what I tried:

launched default t2 instance.
first did a sudo apt-get update, upgrade-dist to make sure everything is up do date. Rebooted instance, ssh still works ok.
then downloaded ssh 6.9p1 and installed it, per this blog:

https://kenkoehlerca.wordpress.com/2015/01/07/upgrading-to-openssh-6-7p1-on-ubuntu/

All good, no errors, sshd is confirmed running, but when I try to ssh, the authentication fails and the key, which was generated by the AWS console and used successfully to login until now, no longer works. The ssh -vvv debug always ends with:

<snippet..I can provide full log>
debug2: we sent a publickey packet, wait for reply
debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey
debug2: we did not send a packet, disable method
debug1: No more authentication methods to try.
Permission denied (publickey).

After some digging, I found another article stating that Amazon authentication relies on PAM.
So then I redid the whole thing on a new instance including the --with-PAM option in the ssh .configure script. But still I couldn't login.

I compared the upgraded instance ssh debug with another default instance ssh debug and I cannot tell the difference, except for some of the ciphers (weak ones disabled after upgrade). I also tried detaching the upgraded, volume, attaching to a good instance and comparing directory permissions, ssh config files, authorizedkeys, etc and found no differences (doesn't mean there aren't, but I couldn't find them). The only relevant change I noticed is the upgraded instance had a couple extra keys generated by default in the /etc/ssh, but I don't see why that would be relevant. The authorizedkeys was the same, so I expected I'd be able to login with ""ubuntu"" as before.

In short, my one and simple question is: does anyone know the steps to successfully upgrade to ssh 6.7 or later on a default Ubuntu EC2 ?

Hello,

I can verify that several customers are reporting slowness or timeouts with eu-west-1.ec2.archive.ubuntu.com.

Unfortunately, this repository is completely managed by Canonical who provide the Ubuntu AMIs, so we do not have the ability to fix the issue ourselves.

We have contacted them regarding the slowness and timeouts and will push them to resolve the issue.

In the meantime, I would suggest adjusting your apt settings to utilize the public mirrors, instead of the AWS specific mirrors with the following command:

Amazon EC2	"VZ-FIOS-US-EAST
Hi Everyone, 

I have been experiencing this issue since 1/1/2014, There Here is my history on the matter thought i would share(so we can all benefit from and maybe reach a solution together): 

After much research and Testing, I Found out that any AWS Customers who have Verizon FIOS in the North EAST region of the United States will experience an increased latency and packet loss and bandwidth degradation to AWS Region in Virginia US EAST, between 12 PM EST -12AM EST time, this has been happening for the past 1 months with no clear answer from Verizon why this happens. (It is Clear that the route to AWS Networks in VA US-EAST-1 Region using Verizon FIOS this will always happen). I have tried this from 3 different sites: Pittsburgh(~666 miles away from Philadelphia), Philadelphia, and Surrounding Philadelphia.

FIOS is available in NY, NJ, Delaware, and all over the Northeast Quarter of USA. Now that’s a huge Gap. This issue happens to any Verizon FIOS customers. FIOS has the highest internet speeds and greatest bandwidth at the lowest price that is symmetrical that you can buy for a business or home. 300/300 Mbits 150/150 Mbits etc. From what seems to me is the whole Northeast Quarter of the USA this happens too (I only have data from 3 different sites).

Comcast Customers here in the NE Quarter of US do not experience any of these issues. But Comcast speeds here in the NE Quarter at its highest speeds 150/20 UP/Down.

Now were talking about public internet providers ISP’s. Which impacts everyday people, and small to medium size businesses who rely on a reliable consist connection to the internet at the speeds we signup for. Who cannot afford over $500-$1500 private internet connection. We shouldn’t accept speed and bandwidth to change if I want to visit a certain site or make a connection with specific provider. It’s VZ and the other Major providers responsibility to route internet traffic fairly, consistently, and without degradation to any resource over the internet). It’s their responsibility to maintain Net-Neutrality, but from this evidence it’s simply NOT. This impacts application performance over the internet, any hosted application on AWS US-EAST, VZ FIOS customers will always have a degradation between 12 pm and 12 am est. This affects all AWS Resources in US-EAST. 

We have been having bandwidth/latency Issues to AWS (Amazon Networks in Virginia) from WEST Conshohocken , Pennsylvania (PA) , Valley Forge, PA and Pittsburg, PA . Between the hours of 12 am –to 12 pm EST we are at normal/best performance but from 12 pm(noon) - 12 am (midnight) there is a significant drop in bandwidth and latency. About a 3x-4x drop in both. We have found that the problem lies with VZ public routing to AS209 which is routing the packets incorrectly (strong statement). I have attached all the required trace routes (LFT) and an alternative AS number to be routed to. Packets should leave the AS701 to be routed to AS7922( I have performed test on this AS and it is routing properly to Virginia with the least amount of latency compared to the AS209 which seems to be the troublesome AS).

I have zipped attached folder with all the data gathered for best and worst (Results tested from the Verizon FIOS Boxes, from different sites)
Please Review!!!. 

My results from LFT tell me there is an Issue with AS701 that it should not be passing traffic to Qwest AS209 and a better Route Would be AS7922 (Comcast) to get to Virginia (AS16509)(Amazon).

I have reached out with this information to VZ more than once and long times on the phone…… and they believe it’s an acceptable degradation in service, and they do not have control over a big public route like the one traffic is taking from the VZ-FIOS customers to AWS. While I did reach out to the other provider Qwest AS209, They to said that they cannot change the route for VZ –FIOS customers to AWS, that a bigger Internet power controlled the route, they cannot assist any further.

So my only conclusion after a year of fighting this, is for:

AWS to provide a workaround to this public routing issue for VZ-FIOS Customers ( this the one possible solution I have thus far):

AWS allows its VZ FIOS Customers to route their traffic to Virtual Private Gateways and Public Gateways that are on different networks AS’s ( a colocation for example CoreSite NY1 & NY2, Equinix DC1 - DC6 & DC10) , that take a different Route to AWS EAST-1-Region so it bypasses the normal route traffic and not get degraded. Basically an entry point for VPN traffic and Public Traffic to AWS EAST-1. AWS customers can changes configuration in their router for certain AWS IP-Blocks to always be routed to this Virtual Private Gateway or Public Gateway. So somehow traffic needs to be routed around bad AS’s. or AWS puts the pressure on the ISP’s to fix these issue. 

If AWS does not provide a viable option:
Possible solutions? Please add more here? Want to know what can possibly be done so you get the best connection for VZ-FIOS customers to AWS EAST-1

-An organization can make Virtual Router or Physical Router that is in one of AWS colocations or anywhere on the internet that has a reliable consistent connection to AWS-EAST-1 (obviously test the route make sure you getting the best performance out of each route and make sure the route doesn’t change for a period of time , test latency and bandwidth using tools like mtr and iperf). And Route all AWS traffic to that router for routing to AWS P for Public and Private traffic.

I've noticed the same with both a FiOS residential and FiOS business account (w/ static IP). Have you gotten any response or further resolution on this?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: VZ-FIOS-US-EAST
I can also confirm this issue.  I have two FiOS connections, one commercial in ZIP 20191 and on residential in 20147.  If ZIP code 20147 looks familiar, it may be because it's Ashburn, VA.  I literally live less than 2 miles from the AWS EC2 us-east-1 datacenters and my connection drops packets at a rate of about 30% between about 8:00pm EST and 12:00am EST almost every night.  I have been logging this loss for at least 6 months.  The bad peering (or whatever is causing it) makes the connection grind to a halt.  Downloading anything from S3 in us-east-1 is going at a rate of about 1Kbps right now on my 150Mbps connection.  Interestingly, when I connect from some of my servers in EC2 back to my servers on FiOS, there is no problem (although I can see it going out a different route).

When using an Elastic IP, you need to request additional SMTP traffic for that IP in This Form. It's pretty annoying because you have to have your A record pointing to this IP whilst AWS decides if your request is satisfactory and in the meantime you don't get any mail.

The way to do it is to use the standard external IP for the host for the time being as your MX record with a different A record. Then, set up another A record to point to your EIP, make the request, and await the email from them saying they allowed SMTP traffic. At that point, then you can bind the EIP to your instance and change your MX records accordingly. Frustrating, but that's how they do it."

Amazon EC2	"AWS AutoScaling Default Termination Behavior
Does anyone know or does anyone have recommendations on how best to handle instances that fail in Autoscaling Groups?  Is it possible to simply remove the instance from the ASG and place it aside for postmortem as opposed to simply terminating it?

Any input would be appreciated."
Amazon EC2	"Re: AWS AutoScaling Default Termination Behavior
Hi! Once an instance has been marked for termination by Auto Scaling, either because the instance failed health checking or if there is a scale-in activity, it will be terminated. However, if you want to debug the instance you can add a lifecycle hook to  your Auto Scaling group for instance termination. You will have a maximum of 48h to complete your debugging activities. During this time you will need to heartbeat Auto Scaling to let us know you are still working and have not completed the hook. Hope this helps."

Amazon EC2	"Security group seemingly ignored
Hi,

I'm using Atlassian bamboo elastic cloud which creates dynamic EC2 instances as build workers. The process that spawns the instance assigns two security groups. One provides basic inbound access to some ports and outbound is open all protocols to 0.0.0.0/0. The other group is empty with the same outbound rules. The instance that is created cannot connect to the internet at all. 

I have another group which is identical (same VPC etc) apart from the name, if I apply that group to my instance then it can access the internet immediately. I've tried taking a copy of this group and applying the name supplied by bamboo but this also doesn't work.

Amazon EC2	"Multi AZ Autoscaling - How does the balancing work?
Hello,

We are planning to use a multi-az autoscaling group to have a more resilient infrastructure. However we are dealing with a small amount of instances in the scaling group, so we're worried about how does the balancing between AZ:s work. Instance count can range around 2-10.

I'm under the impression that if an AZ goes dark, autoscaling will start creating instances on the another (working) AZ, until there are the minimum limit of instances running again. However how aggressively does it balance instances when both AZ:s are working?

Lets say everything is working properly, and az-a has 1 instance and az-b has 2 instances. Now the load decreases and we would scale down by one instance. Would it in this case always terminate the instance that's found in az-b, so both availability zones would have an equal instance count?

Also if the case was that our ASG had a preferred size of 2 instances, and two instances currently reside in one AZ only. Would ASG then actively rebalance the instances by terminating one instance and recreating it in the empty AZ?

I know AZ:s don't go dark every day, but this would help us understand better how the ASG:s work under the hood."

Hi! Auto Scaling does actively rebalance across all of your AZs for you. In your first example, if az-a has 1 instance and az-b has 2 instances, and you need to scale-in by 1 instance, Auto Scaling will terminate the instance from az-b. 

In your second example, if you have specified two AZs (az-a and az-b) in your Auto Scaling group, and you have a desired capacity of 2 instances but they are all in az-a, Auto Scaling will first launch an instance in az-b, and then terminate an instance from az-a.

Amazon EC2	"Re: ELB saying ""Instance is stopped"" but its running
Hello, 

Thanks for your post. 

This is expected behavior from the ELB. If an instance is stopped while assigned to the ELB, then restarted it takes a very long time for the ELB to recognize it again. We recommend de-registering the instance before stopping it and registering back when it is up and running again. 

Since you are already using the CLI to stop the instance, you can add the de-register command to take it off the ELB. 

Here is a link to the documentation to de-register the instance from the ELB via the CLI:
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/elb/deregister-instances-from-load-balancer.html

And here is a link to the documentation to register the instance to the ELB via the CLI in case you are interested in scripting that as well:

Hello,

You are looking at the correct directive to understand the status of your EBS volume.

The reason you are seeing a discrepancy for a some time just after you creating the volume would be due to eventual consistency.  All distributed systems are eventually consistent. The same applies with Amazon EC2 APIs. This is described in the following documentation URL:

the documention you refer to says:

Confirm the state of the resource before you run a command to modify it. Run the appropriate Describe command using an exponential backoff algorithm to ensure that you allow enough time for the previous command to propagate through the system.

is it safe to repeat trying the failing command until it succeeds or a maximum time is reached? so far it seems to work.  now, i start with a 1 second delay to the next try, doubling it each time, and give up when it passes 64 (i may extend that to 128).

Amazon EC2	"How to reference multiple IPs in security groups
Hi,

I'm new to AWS, and have spent about 4 hours reading articles and searching the web but can't find the answer to this one. 

Scenario: I have multiple ext IP addresses which I need to allow access to about 8 different ports on an EC2 instance.

It looks like I can't add multiple IP addresses against a single port rule in AWS security groups (which seems unnecessarily awkward and illogical to me, but whatever) I see you can reference other security groups, but I've tried creating a new security group (lets call it ""ext IP group""), adding all my IPs to that, and then referencing it against the port rule which is assigned to the AWS instance, but it didn't work.

Under the ""ext IP group"" what I didn't understand was, what are you supposed to use for the protocol types and ports etc? I want to use the same IP against several different protocols and ports so I don't want to restrict it. I even tried using ""all traffic"" (which seems like a security risk) but even that didn't work.

When I referenced it in the security group which is linked to my EC2 server, it auto-completed it form a list as I started typing ""sg..."" so I know I've referenced it correctly.

I must be doing something very stupid, or missing something very simple here. Can anyone help me please?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: How to reference multiple IPs in security groups
the reference to another security group is a reference to the INTERNAL AWS addresses using that group. it allows all those instances to match that rule.  it is not a means to include a rule.  a rule can have just ONE external address and either one port or a range of ports. so if you need to allow access to 3 separate ports from 5 external IPs exactly, that means 15 rules!

what i usually do is open a CIDR block and/or port range in SG rules and refine it in the instance OS by an appropriate means there."
Amazon EC2	"Re: How to reference multiple IPs in security groups
Thank you for your reply and explanation.

It seems crazy to me that you can't add a list of IPs somewhere, and then apply them all to a rule. Unfortunately I can't use a CIDR block as the external IPs aren't in a block! Creating a rule for every single IP is really inefficient, and I think I read that you can only add 50 rules per SG.. so I'm going to run out really quickly.

I was able to create a new instance and save all my data and applications within an hour or so. Here're the steps I took:

The moment I noticed 'Terminated' next to my instance, I didn't waste much time as I had a feeling the instance as well as the Volumes attached to it would disappear soon. If you have Delete on Termination flag true during the launch of the instance, chances are you will lose your volumes in a few hours after the instance is terminated. 

1. I clicked on the Volumes tab, and created snapshots of the two volumes that were used by my terminated instance (root volume and an additional 20GB EBS volume). 
2. I created a new instance in the same Availability Zone and launched it. I then stopped that instance, detached the root volume of this new instance, attached my root volume of the terminated instance at /dev/sda1, and attached my second volume as xvdf.
3. I attached my previous Elastic IP from the old instance to this new one, started the new instance and it tested fine.

Amazon EC2	"TCP Retransmission Errors
We have an application that makes around 40 web requests per second to another server in EC2.  The application hits a ELB as shown below:

Server A > ELB > Server B

We have a couple times an hour that a batch of web requests will take around 20 seconds to all finish.  I have run tcpdump on the server and when this occurs Server A has to retransmit the TCP packet multiple times before receiving an ACK from Server B.

Sample Request with sample timestamps
Server A > Server B SYN  0.000
Server A > Server B TCP Retransmission  3.003233 seconds
Server A > Server B TCP Retransmission  6.007996 seconds
Server A > Server B TCP Retransmission  12.032007 seconds
Server B > Server A SYN, ACK

I have changed my application to kill the request and retry it if the socket doesn't receive the first ACK within 750 milliseconds.

Amazon EC2	"Re: TCP Retransmission Errors
Wow, I'm experiencing issues almost identical to what's described in this thread:

latency is typically very low (under a second), but for ~5% of requests, the latency is 30-90seconds+
when I bypass the ELB, and connect directly to the backend, I have no high-latency requests whatsoever (even when doing it simultaneously with the other latent requests)
tcpdump on the backend server indicates that retransmissions are happening exactly for the cases when the latency spikes.


This only happens when there is a reasonable load -- I'm sending about 500-1000 requests per second, and each request is about 100KB request + reply.  Judging from the ELB logs, it seems like there is only 1 ip address assigned to the ELB (which I take to to mean there is only 1 instance working on behalf of the ELB).

Amazon EC2	"Re: TCP Retransmission Errors
I think we narrowed down the problem.  The ELB was configured for cross-az load balancing, and had all 5 AZ's enabled (us-east-1a through us-east-1e).  Only a couple of the AZ's actually had instances in them at the time.  When we ""unchecked"" those unused AZ's in the AWS console, the problem went away.

The only theory I have at this point is that there is non-trivial packet loss between 2 of the AZ's (not sure which ones). And that when traffic flows to an ELB instance in one AZ, but then hits backends in another AZ (to which is has packet loss), high latency ensues.

I'm still playing around with the ELB to see if I can pinpoint which pair of AZ's are to blame.

Hope this helps other people out there."

Amazon EC2	"Re: Scheduled event and other notifications
Hello,

I understand that you would like to be able to receive scheduled event notifications about specific topics in addition to the account's main email address.

Based on my understanding with account settings, all email notifications for account changes are sent to the root account email address, but it is definitely possible to set-up Billing, Operations, and Security Alternate Contacts. These can be configured to include email lists and changes can be done via the ""My Account"" page-

1. Navigate to the ""Account Settings"" page of your Billing Console here:
https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home?#/account

2. Click ""Edit"" next to ""Alternate Contacts"".

3. Fill in the information for your alternate contact, and click ""Update"".

The email address of your Billing contact will be sent a copy of your monthly PDF invoice
The email address of your Operations contact will be sent account maintenance notifications
The email address of your Security contact will receive security related event notifications


For more information about changing this and other information for your account, check out our documentation here:

Amazon EC2	"Re: Machine unavailable
Hello  M. Rodrigues,

I did take a look at your instance and could identify the following things which could possibly making your instance to fail the status checks.

Kindly note that your instance was failing System Instance Status Checks. This check verifies that your instance's operating system is accepting traffic. These checks monitor your software and network configuration for this instance.

I could see that your instance was hitting 100% CPU utilization at certain periods. This could result in the instance to not respond to the health checks.

Also, I could see that your instance is using a 10GB General Purpose EBS volume. Though general purpose volumes can burst upto 3000 IOPs, once there are no IO credits left, they will be providing an IOPs rate of 3 IOPs per GB which means your volume gets limited to 30 IOPs till it gain IO credits. If you try to push more IO to the volume during this period, it will result in having high IO wait on your instance level and you could see processes going to D state in ps command output and also the load average might increase due to this.

So, considering the load you are putting, I would recommend you to choose an instance which is atleast bigger than a t2.micro and have bigger EBS volume which will provide your volume a better base IOPs rate, more IO credits and shorter IO credit refill period.

Regards
Shiroy"

I have been buying a variety of books through Amazon , and have long known AWS, have been hoping to use what AWS services , so although not very specific needs , I immediately entered the page.

My English is not good, and it is the first time I use AWS services, so I use the Chinese language interface. When I use the admin UI in AWS. I think it just launched a free service ( because of the AD ), I don't know there is such a cost. So I built a AWS as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud running Linux/UNIX.

After that, I did not used this server, you can check my account operational records. And, because it is the first time, I do not know how to query the cost, what happens in case I did not know, until yesterday received from the bank sent a debit message, say my credit card was charged $ 723.49.

I can not afford this high cost. I am an ordinary Chinese entrepreneurs, my hole year host cost is $230 for my website.

我的英文不好，而且是第一次使用AWS服务，所以当时我使用的是中文界面，我认为只是开通了一个免费的服务，并不清楚会有这么高的费用，也就捆绑了信用卡（通常都会捆绑）。

开通后，我完全没有使用过这台服务器，可以查询我的账号操作记录。而且，由于是第一次使用，我并不知道怎样查询发生的费用情况，在我并不知情的情况下，我的AWS一直在产生费用，直到今天收到银行发来的扣款短信，说是我的信用卡被扣款723.49美元。

Amazon EC2	"Creating new AMI from running PV instance store instance
Hi,

I'm trying to create a new AMI from a running paravirtual instance-store instance (Ubuntu 12.04 LTS x86_64), to no avail.

I've tried following the documentation both at 

http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/creating-an-ami-instance-store.html

and 

http://blog.tcs.de/create-instance-store-ec2-ami-from-running-instance/

but, while I can succeed in creating an AMI bundle and registering it, when I try to create a new instance from the new AMI, the AWS console shows it as booted, but I can never reach it. Additionally, the AWS instance status checks never pass, and the console output is always blank.

$ aws ec2 get-console-output --instance-id i-ebc53c43                                                                                                                 
 
'Output'


I've kept the above instance  i-ebc53c43 up and running (though utterly nonfunctional) in case any AWS staffers see this.

FWIW, I have no reason not to convert to HVM, but the existing instance, whose general configuration state I'm aiming to store (it's a long, sad configuration-management story) happens to be PV and instance store. The first link above (AWS doc) says early on ""HVM instances only"" but the context of that constraint is not entirely clear.

Thanks!"

Hi Giorgio,

Thanks for replying. We understood that our kernel does not have xen supporting modules and we think that this is causing the failure.

So what I'm looking for is information on the xen related modules that are required by AWS. I built the kernel with the config options mentioned in this page http://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/Mainline_Linux_Kernel_Configs and then tried to import it into AWS. But it still failed. Can you let me know what additional config options that we need to enable?

Taking a look, it appears the subnet chosen for that AZ (""subnet-c074d1b7"") has a path for 0.0.0.0/0 in the route table to a NAT instance.  For public accessibility, it will need to mirror your ap-southeast-1a subnet (""subnet-1fd0557a"") and have that path point to a VPC Internet Gateway.

Amazon EC2	"ENI fails to pass traffic for VPC NAT/route table
I have a VPC (172.x.0.0/16) with dual NAT instances, and I am starting to migrate instances into the private subnets from EC2 Classic. The NAT instances are configured to attach a permanent ENI (with an EIP associated) after boot as eth1. This had previously seemed to be working, but after extensive testing, one of the ENIs seems to be failing to pass traffic properly. 

The route tables (one for each AZ) are similarly configured, and the flow logs indicate that test traffic is not being rejected. VPC security groups are not the problem, as I can create 2 instances in the same security group, and ping/curl fail to the internet from one AZ but not the other. When I switch the VPC route table to the ""good"" AZ, traffic flows normally.

The issue is preventing EC2/Opsworks instances from completing their initial build, as they are unable to curl/download necessary files.

Has anyone run into a similar issue, or have thoughts on how to troubleshoot the traffic to this ENI?"

Amazon EC2	"EC2 Instance (Ubuntu 14.04) Not Accessible After Reboot

The minute I stop/start or reboot the instance, I am no longer able to connect (PuTTY message: ""Network error: Connection timed out"").  Any insight on how to resolve this issue will be greatly appreciated."
Amazon EC2	"Re: EC2 Instance (Ubuntu 14.04) Not Accessible After Reboot
Hello,

You may wish to check your networking configuration which is located here: /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts

The file you will want to look into will look similar to this: ifcfg-eth0

The contents of the file should look like this:

DEVICE=eth0
BOOTPROTO=dhcp
ONBOOT=yes
TYPE=Ethernet
USERCTL=yes
PEERDNS=yes
IPV6INIT=no
PERSISTENT_DHCLIENT=yes

If you find that none of these fixes the issues, then take a look at the following logs from the time you performed the last reboot to now:

/var/log/secure
/var/log/dmesg
/var/log/cloud-init.log
/var/log/boot.log
/var/log/messages
Including any related application logs. It's possible that these logs may provide some insight into why your instance is receiving status check errors.

I'd also confirm that sshd is starting successfully during boot. Also, if you issue a stop/start and your instance is not within a VPC then the instance IP will change. So I just would check to make sure you are connecting to the correct IP after a stop/start and reboot.

We also got a pretty detailed guide here on troubleshooting instance status checks - http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstances.html#InitialSteps"

This issue still needs addressed. I am having the same problem and the logs show that my two ENI's are not being brought up after reboot. After sorting through various logs from the down instance I saw odd issues with DHCP but this doesn't seem like the issue since the interfaces aren't up at all.

I have lost two instances in the last 3 days from this now. My reproduction of this is probably fairly easy.

I create a new instance from the Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (non-HVM) AMI, I login and setup UFW with some additional rules (fully verified, very simple port exceptions), and after a reboot there all is good,. Then I installed the following packages:

mysql-server
postfix
postfix-mysql
postfix-cluebringer
postfix-cluebringer-mysql
postfixadmin

You need to create a default route pointing to an IGW (Internet Gateway) to access this instance.
To do, you first need to create an IGW and associate it with your VPC. Once done, in VPC route table rtb-afe310cb, add a default route pointing to your IGW.

I terminated that instance that I had and deleted the VPC and all resources tied to it. I then tried to create a new instance and I get the error again...""There was an error creating the VPC. An unknown error occurred.""
So there was no VPC and when the EC2 instance tries to start up it tries to create a new VPC to be in but it errors out. 
Is this because there is no VPC already created? Previously I did not have to have a VPC already created and I could spin up an instance without one."

Amazon EC2	"Re: A box became not reachable
Hi cvpbsc,

""Calling 'http://169.254.169.254/2009-04-04/meta-data/instance-id' failed""

Cloud init needs to call 169.254.169.254 to pull meta-data for a successful boot.
A couple of common reasons why it might be failing:

1. IPTables may have somehow become enabled and enforced to block a range which includes 169.x.x.x
2. SELinux or other firewall application may have been enabled and set to enforcing which is blocking the connection
3.) Network misconfiguration

If this is an IPTables issue, you will want to check the /etc/sysconfig/iptables file to examine your chains. To do this, you will need to detach and attach the Volume of the Instance to another Instance. Here is some documentation to assist you with that.

Detach Volume: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-detaching-volume.html
Attach Volume: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-attaching-volume.html

If you find the rules are correct, you may wish to check your networking configuration which is located here: /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts

The file you will want to look into will look similar to this: ifcfg-eth0

The contents of the file should look like this:

DEVICE=eth0
BOOTPROTO=dhcp
ONBOOT=yes
TYPE=Ethernet
USERCTL=yes
PEERDNS=yes
IPV6INIT=no
PERSISTENT_DHCLIENT=yes

Additional:
Check the /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 file and see if you have a MAC in there, if so disable it.
Check to see if you have a udev rule for the NIC in /etc/udev/rules.d/  if you have a rule try disabling it.

If you find that none of these fixes the issues, then take a look at the following logs from the time you performed the last reboot to now:

/var/log/secure
/var/log/dmesg
/var/log/cloud-init.log
/var/log/boot.log
/var/log/messages

Additional information which may prove useful in your diagnostics:

Status check errors and what they mean - http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstances.html

Recover an unreachable Linux instance - https://aws.amazon.com/articles/5213606968661598

If the above doesn't help to resolve the issue then it would be best to restore your instance to state before you started making changes.

Amazon EC2	"Re: SYN Flood Protection?
Is there anything I can do to secure my instance?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: SYN Flood Protection?
Hi. When you say your local load balancer, what do you mean? If you are referring to ELB, it does not look like those connections are coming through that but rather that they are coming directly to the instance. An ELB should not put through the SYN packets in HTTP/HTTPS mode. 

If you are indeed using an ELB (and it looks like you are), you can follow this documentation in order to only allow connections from your ELB and hence you should not receive the SYN flood anymore:
http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-elb-security-groups.html

Hope this helps. If the procedure for allowing only your load balancers to connect doesn't work for you or you have questions, let us know.

Best regards

Amazon EC2	"Re: SYN Flood Protection?
My application does application level load distribution, so I do not need elastic load balancing.  But, I am concerned about SYN Flood and other DOS attacks, and would like to insure TCP handshake completes before packet is forwarded to my server.  Is the ELB the best solution for this?

If I also control the software running on legitimate clients, are there other techniques like SYN-cookie that would work just as well?"

Amazon EC2	"AWS instances unreachable
I've had 3 instances become unreachable within the last week or so and I can't figure out what's going on.

The first time was close to a week ago and it happened to an established server that I'd had for a couple months for testing purposes.  I only had very limited time to look into it, but when I tried I was unable to connect to it at all, which is the first I've had a problem like that.  I figured I'd have to mount the volume on a recovery instance to get it reachable again so I destroyed the original instance, retaining the volume.

This morning I finally had time to try to look into it.  I created instance i-817c4776 and loaded the standard AWS Linux image onto it, confirmed I could log into the instance, turned it off, attached my old volume to it, was able to log in and make some changes that I thought would make the old instance accessible again.  I then turned off the instance, detached both volumes and attached my original volume as the root volume to see if I could boot it and access it now.  I couldn't, so I detached the volume and re-attached the original testing volume back to the instance so I could boot back into it and do some more checking.  This instance was never reachable again.  I tried several reboots and using my original Elastic IP and not using it.  I made sure to use the new IP address after each reboot when I wasn't using the Elastic IP, since those change.  Never did get back into it.

I terminated that instance and created i-c9665d3e, once again with the standard Amazon Linux image.  This instance has never been reachable for me.  I've even removed my more restrictive Security Groups from the instances and applied one that doesn't restrict traffic at all.  

I can see from the System Log that the network interface came up and in fact Yum updated 4 packages for security fixes upon boot, so I know that it has a working network connection. I've also tried connecting to these from two different locations using different ISPs so it's not something to do with my outgoing connection.

I don't know what's going on here but it would be great if someone could look into it and let me know, please.

Thank you!"

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/UsingConfig_WinAMI.html

Amazon EC2	"Re: Can Not Get password after creating an instance
Hi Philip,

We can not ""turn on"" the password for you, and the AMI owner will need to update it fix the issue. 
However, as can be seen by the link here that AMI is almost 2 years old. You may want to consider using a fresher AMI.

Amazon EC2	"Convert public ip assigned to instance and make elastic (sticky on reboots)
I have around 10 instances I created, and I did not assign elastic ips to them (though they have a public ip). I'd like to change this and take the current public ip assigned to each instance, and make it elastic (sticky across reboots). Is this possible? How?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: Convert public ip assigned to instance and make elastic (sticky on reboots)
Hello,

Unfortunately, converting a public IP to an EIP is not supported at the moment. 
You will need to allocate new elastic IPs and then associate them with your instances. 

By default, there is a limit of 5 EIPs per region for each AWS account which can be increased upon request: http://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/eip_limit_request/

When associating an EIP with an instance, the currently associated public IP will be released and cannot be recovered:
""We release the public IP address for your instance when you associate an Elastic IP address with your instance, or when you associate an Elastic IP address with the primary network interface (eth0) of your instance in a VPC. When you disassociate the Elastic IP address from your instance, it receives a new public IP address. ""(http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html)

Amazon EC2	"Re: Not able to connect using RDP to a Windows server
Is the instance in a subnet with a proper route to your RDP client, and does the Security Group that your instance is a member of take this into account?

For instance, if you are connecting to the instance via the Internet then the instance MUST have a public IP address (unless you are using port forwarding via a NAT Proxy). Your security group must allow inbound traffic on port 3389 from your Client. The software package you use shouldn't really make much difference, it's the basic network setup you will need to look at.

Well, i've found the solution and this maybe can help someone with Centos installation.
I had a previous problem like this. basically if you create a VM with a centos image the network won't work.
So since the only way to access the remote machine you have to do this:

1) Follow the guide to detach and reattach a disk to a working machine here

2) When you are able to access the disk from the new instance follow this instructions Here. Basically you have to do this:


cd /etc/udev/rules.d
cp 70-persistent-net.rules /root/
rm 70-persistent-net.rules


Watch out! This must be done in the mounted volume and not in the ""real"" /etc. So if you have used the link above to mount the disk you have /bad/etc..

Hope this help."

Amazon EC2	"i-5d31a39c  Status Reason: Instance became unhealthy while waiting
Hi,

A couple of days ago, while autoscaling is creating new instances, we started to experience the following situation [1] . 

Since some forum posts suggest that hitting some AWS limits may cause this problem, we tried to increase the desired instance number as high as 10 (normally our setup only ranges from 1 to 3) but we couldn't reproduce the same situation.

edit:
The interesting part is, almost always a successful scale up operation follows the ""Cancelled"" one. For example;


autoscaling decides to add 2 more instances, (going from 1 to 3)
it fires up two events to create new instances
one event creates 1 instance successfully
then the next one gets cancelled with the error message below [1]
after that another event creates 2nd instance successfully


Is there a way to get more information on this event and determine the true cause of this behavior?

Thank you.

Hi Htike, 

Sorry for the delay here. 

I think you may have missed one of the steps from my colleagues process: 
When you attach the root volume from the instance that is having issues to the new temporary instance, you will need to mount the registry from the defective instance. You may wish to consider taking a snapshot of the corrupted root volume in case anything happens during the steps below with the problem volume. 

More precise steps are listed below: 
1. Stop the problem instance. Detach the root volume and attach it to another working instance at xvdf.
2. Login to the other instance; Open up Disk Management (snap-in) and bring the disk online. The disk will now become accessible in Windows Explorer.
3. Launch REGEDIT.EXE, select HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.
4. Go to File menu, select Load Hive…
5. Browse to this path: D:\Windows\System32\config (assuming the second disk has drive letter D)
6. Select the file SYSTEM (no file extension)
7. When prompted, enter a name (it doesn’t matter what you call it): TEST
8. Go to this location in the registry: [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\TEST\ControlSet001\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\Interfaces\
9. At this location, each network interface will be exposed as a GUID. Select the correct NIC. Usually this will have multiple registry keys including the key Enable DHCP
10. If DHCP was disabled and a static IP was assigned, the REG_DWORD registry key “EnableDHCP” should be set to 0. Change its value to 1 to enable DHCP.
11. Click HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE. Go to File, choose Unload Hive…
12. Detach the drive, attach to the original instance and start that instance.

Hopefully this gets you back online. If you still have issues, feel free to post again.

Amazon EC2	"Very poor EBS-Optimized performance of a 750GB SSD volume
I just ran a few crude benchmarks of an EC2 r3.xlarge instance with EBS-Optimized turned on and a 750GB SSD volume and got very poor performance. Are there any tricks either inside of the instance (running Ubuntu), or options with AWS to improve i/o performance without enabling provisioned iops on the volume?

The first benchmark was a simple:

    hdparm -tT /dev/xvdf

Only got around 50 MB/sec on average (5 runs).

I ran the benchmark on a Google compute instance with a 500GB volume and averaged 250 MB/sec.

I also ran the benchmark on a 16GB droplet on DigitalOcean and averaged 350 MB/sec.

Amazon EC2	"Re: Very poor EBS-Optimized performance of a 750GB SSD volume
I run a bunch of servers in a traditional hosting center where I use gigabit switches. 

Now in Amazon the network is much more capable, yet your assigned bandwidth is defined by which instance type you decided for. Here even a modest instance type gets 50% of gigabit speed, which I think is really nice. Your 50MB per second roughly translates to 500 mbps.
See also  http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSOptimized.html

Yes I would like better speeds as well, and my option is to select a bigger instance for that. 
Hope this helps."

Wow, that is crazy. I've never see that table before. Honestly, a 50MB/s cap is quite poor, seeing as Google instances get 5x performance and DigitalOcean is even faster than GCE.

The message Connection refused indicates that there is no service listening on the port you are trying to connect to.

Firstly I would remove your attachments from this thread, you dont want people having access to the keys for this instance.

Secondly, can you answer the following questions:

If in your own VPC:
2 - Confirm you have an Internet Gateway attached to your VPC
3 - Can you confirm you have a route in the subnet that your instance resides in pointing to 0.0.0.0/0 via IGW
4 - Can you confirm the Security Group that your instance is associated with has SSH open from the source you are trying to connect from
5 - Can you confirm you a public IP address of the instance and that you are using the right public IP address to try and connect

I'm seeing the same issue.  I was writing up a long post about all the troubleshooting I've done to investigate this, but I lost it Anyway, I started up a new Windows m1.small instance yesterday and was not able to join it to a Samba 4 domain.  After lots of investigation I discovered that 68 UDP ports outbound were being blocked.  i.e. I could not send UDP traffic from the instance to various UDP ports on a machine on the Internet.  These ports include:6988135136389445686143314341812181320833799amongst others (some in the 9000-9100 range, 35300-35305, and some in the 38700-38800 range).The instance had NO software installed except for Wireshark and Python which I was using for troubleshooting this problem.  The Windows Firewall was not enabled and the Security Groups were set to allow all incoming traffic, but the problem was the outgoing UDP traffic.I then tried a similar test from an m1.large Windows+authentication instance that's been running for a while (i-9b2820f2) and that was able to send out UDP traffic on all UDP ports except for the following:691351361433143459254I can sort of understand port 69 (DHCP), and maybe ports 1433 and 1434 are blocked because of Slammer.  Port 135 might be because of one of the other Windows worms, But what about 136 and 59254?  Is this documented anywhere?  I haven't been able to find it if so.I then started up another m1.small instance (i-1cee0474) to test this problem.  This one could also not send UDP traffic on ports 88, 389, 1433 etc., but could on 87, 89, 388, 390, 1432 etc.I've just created a new m1.large Windows instance (i-6eff1506) and this one can also not send traffic on UDP ports 88 and 389 but can on other ports I've tried.I now have a theory that these ports are blocked for Windows non-auth instances and will test that theory later.If anyone else can point me to where this is documented or explain where I'm going wrong, I would appreciate it."

Amazon EC2	"How to protect my ec2 instance?
I have some ec2 instances under our partner's aws account. they don't have ssh permission to these instances. Now we need to save some security data in these ec2 instances, and we don't want our partner to access these data files. But you know, maybe they can do it like this: create AMI from these ec2 instances, and launch new ec2 instance from this AMI with a new key, then they have ssh permission on this instance and can access everything. So, the question is : How can I protect my ec2 instance from this? Is it possible?

Thx!
Nicolas"
Amazon EC2	"Re: How to protect my ec2 instance?
Try it.

If you have created an image of an instance and then launched it with a new key, it likely won't work because the instance was created using a different key. 

I don't play around too much with Linux instances, being a Windows kinda guy, but it uses the keypair to create the secure key for you to ssh to it using a cert when you launch it from the Amazon AMI. When you image that instance it is a straight copy, so it does not try to generate the secure key or certificate as it already exists.

So try to launch a copy of one of your Linux instances using a different key. You will likely see that it will not allow you to log on using the ""new"" key cert, but you can log on using the ""old"" cert. But like I say, not a Linux guy so there is a (slight) chance it will go horribly wrong"
Amazon EC2	"Malware on Windows 2008 R2 + Unable to update Windows
Hi

I have an instance i-8c1fda72 which I think is corrupted with some coupons malware. 

I am unable to remove this malware. Is there any software which I can use for Windows Server 2008 to detect and clean the files from virus/malware?

Secondly when I start to update the windows, svchost.exe starts to chew up both CPU and memory. and the update remains in ""Checking for updates"" and never moves forward?

Amazon EC2	"Re: Instance i-0309b6d0 Unreachable
Hello mlp-lab,

I'm sorry to see you're having problems with your instance.

The only way around this issue is to...
1. stop the instance, 
2. detach the root volume,
3. attach it to a working instance,
4. mount the volume,
5. edit the etc/fstab to remove all secondary volumes,
6. unmount the volume,
7. detach and return the volume to the original instance, and
8. start the instance.

You can then mount the filesystems manually and perform filesystem checks where necessary.

If you need further assistance please let me know.

Amazon EC2	"Restoring lost Elastic IP
It seems like a recent outage caused a loss of Elastic IP.  Now, we have this IP associated with root servers with our domain name.  Is it possible for AWS to restore back the elastic IP to our account ?

Thank you for the post.

If the Elastic IP address was ""released"" from your AWS account, unfortunately, we can't restore it back. However, if the Elastic IP address was ""disassociated"" from an EC2 instance running under your account, then you can find it on ""Elastic IPs"" page under ""Network & Security"" in the navigation pane from the AWS Management Console.

Amazon EC2	"Newly launched instances sometimes, inconsistently unreachable
I have a VPC with a bunch of running instances in it. As of a couple days ago, when I launch new instances, they are sometimes unreachable.

I have one instance currently suffering this that I have left running: i-5a7d9af2  it was launched at the same time as and configured nearly identically to another instance that is working fine: i-297d9a81

So here are the facts:
0. Instance says ""1/2 checks passed"" and the logs show failure to connect to its private interface on 169.254.169.254
1. The subnet I am launching into has currently running instances that have no problem.
2. When I launch either a stock Ubuntu 14.04 HVM ami (ami-d05e75b8) OR a freshly-created image of one of my other running instances, and it will sometimes work, and sometimes not.
3. I can launch three identically-provisioned instances using Ansible, and sometimes one or two out of the three will be unreachable, while the others are OK.
4. I have tried switching to a completely permissive security group, doesn't matter.
5. My Ansible playbooks were working fine, and then one day this started happening.

I am really at a loss here as to what's going on.

Amazon EC2	"Seems to be something wrong with Amazon network or firewall
This morning around 5:44AM EDT, we started getting spammed by alerts. The monitoring machine we have running in US East is failing to communicate with the servers in our non-Amazon colo. The alerts keep coming, and going, and coming, and going, which means, the network connection is intermittent or experiencing packet loss.

I found, by running two continuous pings on two different machines, on the same non-amazon network, having different externally facing IP addresses, one of them could reach the amazon servers, while the other one couldn't reach it. This suggests the problem is not a down network segment in between Amazon and our colo. It suggests the problem is either at Amazon's end, or at our end.

So I rebooted everything at our end, and problem didn't change.

I looked at firewall rules on amazon, and I saw, we permit Echo Request from our colo network a.b.c.d/e, which should allow both of the aforementioned machines to ping. 

On a hunch, I changed the amazon firewall rule to permit Echo Request from 0.0.0.0/0, and suddenly both machines started getting responses. This conclusively confirms that the problem is not at our end - indeed packets were getting out of our network, and if they had any response, the responses would be received.

So then I removed 0.0.0.0/0 from amazon firewall, and I absolutely confirmed that both of the machines at our colo are in the range a.b.c.d/e, so I absolutely confirmed this should work. But it doesn't.

Additional evidence: This problem started this morning while everyone was asleep. Nothing changed anywhere.

Simply, it seems, there's a weird problem happening on amazon's network and/or firewall.

Instance i-0cf17e6f

Right now, I have amazon configured to allow Echo Request from 0.0.0.0/0, and I have a continuous ping running from two different IP addresses at our colo. One of them is getting responses; the other one is getting no response.

Amazon EC2	"Several systems locked up and rebooted at 7/1 midnight
Hello,

Several of our instances seemed to lock up and then proceed to reboot exactly at 7/1/2015 12:00:00AM UTC. In the monitoring, you can see the CPU jump to 100% and all Disk metrics spike as well. Two of the instances were attached to an ELB and the other was not. Two were in us-east-1e and one was in us-east-1b. All are m3.large. We also have a t2.small instance which did not seem to have any issues.

I checked our RDS instance and that was fine.

The fact that the issues took place right at midnight UTC on the first of the month makes me think there was maybe a job or some AWS process that kicked off? Can someone take a quick look to see if there is an explanation? Our entire application had a few minutes of downtime and I would like to know what caused the instances to reboot.

Let me know if you would like the instance IDs.

Thanks!

Almost certainly the leap second.
Older linux kernels had a bug that would cause the system to lock-up."
Amazon EC2	"Re: Several systems locked up and rebooted at 7/1 midnight
Hello shaunlas,

Rebooting your instances via the console or CLI should resolve this issue.  When you reboot an instance in this way, it remains on the same physical host, so your instance keeps its public DNS name, private IP address, and any data on its instance store volumes.  More information on this topic can be found here: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-reboot.html

For further information on the leap second issue you experienced see: https://access.redhat.com/articles/15145.

Please let me know if you need any further assistance.

Kind regards,
Anthony H."

To answer your questions:-

Have you tried to RDP from another instance located in the same VPC?

No, this is the first VPC based instance I've tried to create.  The entries for subnets, internet gateways, and route tables were all auto-created, attached etc by the EC2 instance launch wizard.  Never even visited VPC part of AWS Console before.  My guess is that the EC2 launch wizard has created all these VPC entries (I certainly didn't!) but omitted to add the route to the internet.  Maybe for your first VPC instance, it could at least ask?

Hello! Again we have a problem with Amazon EC2 DNS 172.16.0.23 (starting 2015.07.02 02:20 PDT). This problems touches our account . We can not use prepaid Amazon services fully. So, 2015.07.02 we have unexpected problem with Amazon EC2 DNS 172.16.0.23. We use this DNS for all our EC2 nodes. Starting 2015.07.02 02:20 PDT it started to resolve DNS names *.appery.io from zone appery.io with errors. As a result, we had a huge down time for our Production nodes (42 nodes). Our customers couldn't use any of our services. It is really big and unpleasant problem for us. We investigated this problem on our side (because we send information about this zone from our DNS), but at that time we didn't make any changes with records and zone appery.io is visible for world DNS servers.

Amazon EC2	"Re: Data gone after rebooting EC2 instance
Hello,

Take snapshot of your EBS volume before you attempt to expand it.

If the total size of your EBS volume is 6GB, you can expand your storage space by following the steps in the following url: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-expand-volume.html

Else if your root partition is 6GB and the total size of your EBS volume is more, you can resize your root partition to cover the unused disk space. Refer to the following url: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/storage_expand_partition.html

Amazon EC2	"EC2 instance's tags ""disappear""
Hi
I had an instance (i-cf547c1f) with 5 different tags.
After a while it seems that all the tags removed from my instance.
Why can it happen? (no one removed them)

I will add that the instance is up from pipeline (used as a worker resource).
The pipeline itself don't use any tags (which AFAIK is a new feature for pipeline), 
and the pipeline is activated since 2015-05-19, it is scheduled to work every 15 minutes and worked well since, until today (2015-06-09), did something changed?

Amazon EC2	"EC2 G2 instance CL_DEVICE_IMAGE2D_SUPPORT and max dimensions (OpenCL)
Hello,

I have scoured the tech details pages for the G2 instances, these forums, and the internet for info on whether the G2 NVIDIA cards have support for the 2D and 3D image features of OpenCL 1.1. My apologies if I didn't look in the proper place and this has been answered elsewhere. That said, can someone confirm for me:

 - Does the device info param CL_DEVICE_IMAGE_SUPPORT on the G2 equal CL_TRUE? (I would assume so given how on the product page AWS advertises that G2 can be used for video and image processing)
 - If so, what are the values of the device info params CL_DEVICE_IMAGE2D_MAX_WIDTH, CL_DEVICE_IMAGE2D_MAX_HEIGHT, CL_DEVICE_IMAGE3D_MAX_WIDTH, CL_DEVICE_IMAGE3D_MAX_HEIGHT, and CL_DEVICE_IMAGE3D_MAX_DEPTH?

I presume that these values will be different for the g2.2xlarge and the g2.8xlarge, so if someone has access to either and can answer these questions, I would really appreciate it. I recognize that it might be possible that these params might not be the same on all instances, and if this is the case, does anyone know the minimum values that we can except these params to be? Do these values fluctuate with the choice of host OS?

Amazon EC2	"Re: Problem accessing the EC2 Instance
Hello,

Could you please verify the permissions on the /home/ubuntu/.ssh directory and files contained in it on this instance?

To verify the permissions, you can stop the instance and detach the root volume (make note of the device that it's attached to). Then attach the volume to another instance on an available device. Create a mount point, such as /fixroot, if needed and mount the device to this mount point. Once mounted, cd to /fixroot/home/ubuntu and check the directory and file permissions. The .ssh directory should allow rwx for the user (owner) and the files should be readable only by the user.

Another thing to check while you are there is that the known_hosts file doesn't have duplicate entries for the client you are attempting to connect from.

Once you have done this, you can unmount the volume and detach it from the instance. Then attach it back to the original instance to the device that you noted in the first step and start the instance.

Let us know if this works for you.

Consumer Verizon FiOS circuits still seem to be passing through the ""bad"" path and as a result are slow.

I am wondering whether anyone has found a solution to the slow connection speed via FiOS to EC2 servers in the us-east region.

I am a business start-up, connecting to EC2 from New York City via two residential internet providers, TimeWarner and Verizon FiOS.  I have a second ISPs as back-up.

My FiOS connection should work much faster and indeed does for most places on the web, but not to the EC2 server I am using.

For instance, when I download data via my RDP connection to my local client, FiOS gives me currently a download speed of 60 kbytes/sec while TimeWarner yields about 7000 kbytes/sec.

Using speedtest.net, however, I get for FiOS a ping rate of 6ms, download speed of 84 Mbytes/sec and upload speed of 92 Mbytes/sec.  The TimeWarner results are: ping rate of 16ms, download speed 122 Mbytes/sec, upload speed of 14 Mbytes/sec (so the FiOS ping and upload results are much better, but the download result is slightly worse).

I've had this issue for a little over a year now.
I've been after VZ for quite some time to resolve this issue.
I kept complaining to them until they sent a network technician to my home. After I've showed him all the evidence i've gathered we ran a few tests (to prove that i wasn't bsing him).  He made a phone call back to VZ, and I was basically told that this is a ""corporate politics issue"". He suggested that the more people complain the more they'll be willing to ""fix"" it. I'm so frustrated by this issue. We have app servers deployed on the AWS cloud that are heavily affected by this.

Observations:
-garbage download speeds (5k to 70Kb/s download speed during normal business hours) 
-upload speeds seem unaffected

If an EBS volume is greater in size then the existing disk label created in the OS

Hi,

Amazon EC2	"Re: Can Amazon IT staff see EC2 data?
Give this a read:

http://media.amazonwebservices.com/pdf/AWS_Security_Whitepaper.pdf

Basically, no, their staff does not have access to the data inside the EBS, S3 or other storage per policy and per internal security controls.  You can encrypt the volumes, etc. if you desire as well.  I think the only time they ever (maybe) get inside a volume is if they have to recover data for a customer due to a massive failure in EBS ... which I recall they've only had once during a major outage in Ireland.  And... they may have not even had that level of access when that happened, they might have been doing all their recovery at the block level (actually that is likely the case).  It's akin to placing your servers in a SSAE16 certified datacenter; there are certainly people with physical access, but it's closely monitored, etc.

If the data is really sensitive, I'd opt to encrypt the volumes, and make very sure that you follow all best practices security the AWS access (root and IAM accounts) to the console --- I recommend that you look at the MFA features of IAM (and perhaps get a token for the root account) to make sure no one gains unauthorized access to your AWS infrastructure.

Amazon EC2	"Re: Free Tier : Windows Instance or Linux Instance or Both?
Hello,

I want to clarify which types of EC2 instance usage is covered under the AWS Free Tier promotion.

The AWS Free Usage Tier promotion provides up to 750 hours per month of Micro instances running specified versions of Windows and another 750 hours of Micro instances running non-commercially licensed versions of Linux on EC2. 

For example, if two t1micro Linux instances are run for 400 hours each in a single month, the user will accumulate 800 instance hours of Linux Micro instance usage, of which 750 hours will be free, and the remaining 50 hours will be billed at the standard EC2 price.

The Free Usage tier will not apply to instances launched with commercially licensed versions of Linux, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Oracle Enterprise Linux, and SUSE Linux Enterprise. Instances running non-free versions of Linux will be billed at the advertised rates, found from this page: http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/#os

Note that EBS usage above the Free Tier allocation of 30 GB-Mo will be billed at the standard EBS storage rates.

Hi  SP,

I had a look at the instance as well as the Security Group attached to the instance (sg-e32cc787).

Currently there is no ingress rule to allow SSH traffic from outside the SG. Currently you have it set to allow ALL traffic that only originates from the source of SG sg-e32cc787, i.e any traffic that is originating from an instance which also as the SG sg-e32cc787. If you are attempting to make a connection from your home/office network outside of AWS it won't work.

I'd start with adding a rule to allow SSH traffic from your location and see if you are able to connect. More info on SG rules can be found here - http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html#SecurityGroupRules

Hi there,

Permission denied (13) is an error coming from the OS - it appears that your OS is not allowing your application to open a socket.

If you have SELinux enabled on your OS and it's currently set to Enforcing, make sure that you have a rule that allows your application to open this connections.
Alternatively, you can try disabling SELinux, see if the connections work - and then adding the necessary rules before enabling SELinux again."

As documented here, root volumes should typically be /dev/sda1 or xvda:

I'd recommend setting your root volume as /dev/sda1 and then try creating an AMI off of it to get this properly working.

There are a few possible issues that could be happening here.  The first is to make sure that your security group is correct, make sure that if you are using your local IP address that it has not changed.  You can verify your public IP address using a number of websites such as ""whatismyip.com"", if you are behind a corporate network, this can change from time to time.

You noted that you could SSH into a different instance, so as long as both instances have the same security group this should be fine.  If you are using any boot strap scripts, they may not have fully completed and I've seen that stall an instance from coming immediately online as well."

Amazon EC2	"Apparent network problem between instance and load balancer
We witnessed what appears to be a network problem on one of our production instances today. We suspect that large network packets coming from one of our load balancers were being blocked (by a router?) before they reached our instance.

The VPC ID is vpc-ee9f1a8b

Actors in this exchange are:

Instance: i-2480b48e with IP 10.0.2.4 (sadly this instance was terminated post investigation)
Load Balancer: internal-Prod25-TrafficLoad-1R731QT20NOQ with IP 10.0.1.186


The load balancer directs HTTP requests to other instances (this was working fine).
On the instance we send a request to the load balancer like this:
$ wget 'http://10.0.1.186:8080/traffic'

This connects to the load balancer and then just sits there.

Snooping the network on the Worker shows there is a network problem:

Packets 01 to 05 are all normal.
Packet 06 is problematic. The START sequence number of the data sent from load balancer to instance jumps from 1 to 8950. This means the load balancer sent data that never made it to the instance. In wireshark this is reported as ""TCP Previous segment lost"".
It appears that one or more network packets sent from load balancer to instance are getting lost. As the MTU in the network is 9001 it is probably a single packet.

We have another (identical) instance on the same IP range. This second instance has no problems communicating with the load balancer.

Based on the above dump my guess is that there is a misconfigured network device between load balancer and instance (close to the instance) which is blocking large packets.

How do we deal with this?"

Amazon EC2	"Re: Can not connect remotely to ec2 instance created using ec2-import-instance
Hi Avik,

Your instances look healthy, but the security group is only open to instances in sg-a5e969c0. So instances in sg-a5e969c0 can talk to your new instances, but you won't have access from the internet. If you are able to add an inbound rule for port 3389 from 0.0.0.0/0 for testing we can at least telnet to the instance for you and check the port is open. Maybe your Windows firewall is blocking?

Or you can try the telnet yourself and post the results here.

$ telnet public_ip 3389

Also please double check that you meet all the import prerequisites - eg a single volume and a single NIC etc.

Amazon EC2	"Re: Can not connect remotely to ec2 instance created using ec2-import-instance
Hi Julian,

Thanks for the assistance.

Here the issue was the default security group being attached with the instance created by ec2-import-instance opens up all traffic from the same security group itself.

Once that is configured to be used from outside the instance is accessible.

But I have  once question here, the command we use for importing instance to amazon cloud does not asks for any security groups, so is there any way to do a pre-configuration of security groups during import operation?

One more observation I have, the instance I have imported as ec2 can be connected successfully using RDP only when the vmdk file used to import, is created from VMWare Workstation.

If it is created by VMWare vSphere Client or VMWare Player then the instance created after successful import is not accessible remotely(although the security groups are configured properly). 

Please verify my observation, it will be  easier for us to create VM images later on.

Thanks,

Amazon EC2	"Re: Can not connect remotely to ec2 instance created using ec2-import-instance
Hi there,

You can import a VM as an AMI image or as an EC2 instance. If you import as an EC2 instance we need to assign at least one security group, so we apply the default group. You can change the security groups in the AWS console or via API before you start the instance. 

EC2 import start instance
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/LaunchingYourVM.html

EC2 default SG
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html#default-security-group

With an AMI import, when you use the launch wizard to create an instance and start it, you can manually chose the security groups. Or you can use the API / CLI to launch an instance from the AMI and specify the SGs. 

AMI launch
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/LaunchVMImportImage.html

CLI run instance
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.html

As for VMWare Workstation, VMWare vSphere Client or VMWare Player, according to our documentation prerequisites page only VMWare vSphere Client is supported. If VMWare Workstation images are working that is good, your mileage may vary, and as i understand VMWare player is unlikely to work at all. 

http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/VMImportPrerequisites.html

AWS supports the following image formats for importing both disks and VMs into Amazon EC2:

RAW format for importing disks and VMs.
Dynamic Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) image formats, which are compatible with Microsoft Hyper-V and Citrix Xen virtualization products. VHDX images are not currently supported.

Stream-optimized ESX Virtual Machine Disk (VMDK) image format, which is compatible with VMware - ESX and VMware vSphere virtualization products.

I hope this helps.

Hi yosi-kal,

It's hard to say at this point what caused the issue. The only for certain is that the server is refusing your key which could be a multitude of reasons.

If you don't have another way to access instance the instance you'll need to stop said instance and detach the root volume, then attach the volume as a secondary device to another instance you have access to. From here you can poke around and ensure the permissions are correct and the keys match up. If not, this will give you a chance to rotate keys, and if you have audit logging enabled on your server figure out how/why the key was changed to begin with.

Hope this helps.

Hi,

Looking at the log file you posted, I see
/usr/bin/mysqld_safe: line 165: /usr/bin/nohup: Cannot allocate memory


This suggests to me that mysql-server or another process is trying to use more memory than you have available on your t2.micro instance. It would also explain why it is being shut down (e.g. by the oom killer).

I would suggest using top or a similar program to figure out what processes are using up memory on your instance. If it is mysql, you can configure the database engine to make it more memory-friendly. Some of the results here might be helpful: https://www.google.com/search?q=mysql+memory+limit

You might also try a larger instance size (e.g. one with more memory).

Amazon EC2	"How do I access my EC2 instance through http?
Hello everyone,

I have searched the web all over and found some answers but I still don't understand.

I have set up a EC2 instance (Red Hat Server) and I have changed the security group of that instance to accept http access from anywhere.

When I type the IP address of the instance or the public DNS on my browser, I get nowhere. How do I access my EC2 instance through http?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: How do I access my EC2 instance through http?
Unfortunately you haven't really provided enough information to track down the problem.

What does ""I get nowhere"" mean? What exactly happens when you navigate to http://<instance-ip-address>/ in a browser?

What HTTP server are you running, and are you sure it's actually listening on port 80?

What happens if you run 'curl http://localhost/' from your instance?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: How do I access my EC2 instance through http?
Hi,

Is this set up in a non default VPC? If so, then you must ensure you have an Internet Gateway associated with your VPC and that your routing table is updated.

The route table associated with the subnet that your instance resides in must have a route out to the public internet, for example: 0.0.0.0/0 via your Internet Gateway.

Can you confirm you have an IGW and that your route to the public domain exists?

Also, check your NACLs to ensure you dont have port 80 blocked at a network level.

Hope this helps,

Amazon EC2	"Re: How do I access my EC2 instance through http?
Hi,

No its not madatory as your instance would just be in the Default VPC.  The default VPC has certain components already configured, such as the IGW and public IP addresses.

It sounds as though your Security Group for the instance is blocking port 80 from your source address, but your first comment indicates otherwise.....are you able to double check the security group?

Amazon EC2	"Re: How do I access my EC2 instance through http?
If connecting to localhost from the instance itself doesn't work, then your main problem has nothing to do with VPCs or security groups. Those affect how traffic is routed from the outside network to your instance, but it's your instance itself that isn't accepting connections.

What do you expect to see when you connect to your instance over HTTP? If you want it to serve web pages, you'll need to install and run an HTTP server such as Apache. Try ""yum install httpd""."

Hello Emilie,

I have taken a look at the instance and the configuration looks correct.

You can check if iptables is running on the instance by using the following command:
sudo service iptables status

To check if there are any rules in iptables, you can use the following command: 
sudo iptables -L -n

I have tried to telnet on both ports 80 and 443 and seeing connection refused below. This is typically means that you Web server is not listening/running on the instance.

Hi,

I would recommend launching a new instance based on an AMI that is known to be clean (e.g. a fresh copy of the latest Amazon Linux AMI, 2015.03) and configuring your application there. Otherwise you may inadvertently miss something. We frequently publish security updates for the Amazon Linux AMI (you can see a list here: https://alas.aws.amazon.com/), so be sure to regularly run yum update to be sure that these are installed and your instance is not vulnerable.

Amazon EC2	"Problems controlling a network interface in an Ubuntu Linux instance
Hi,

    I need to test some code that I've been working on that uses the output of ec2-describe-instance-status
 to determine whether an instance needs to be rebooted. My plan for testing the code was to use a script running on a test instance that brought the network interface down for a set period of time and then brought it back up. Here is the short python script;

import sys
import time
import subprocess
 
nohup = 'nohup '
ifDownCmd = '/sbin/ifconfig eth0 down'
ifUpCmd = '/sbin/ifconfig eth0 up'
 
runIfDownCmd = subprocess.Popen(nohup + ifDownCmd + ' &',stdout=subprocess.PIPE,shell=True)
 
(output, err) = runIfDownCmd.communicate()
print(output + 'cmd1' )
 
time.sleep(10) # time is shortened for testing
 
runIfUpCmd = subprocess.Popen(nohup + ifUpCmd + ' &',stdout=subprocess.PIPE,shell=True)
 
(output, err) = runIfUpCmd.communicate()
print(output + 'cmd2')
 
exit()


I only post the code so you can see what it is doing. I've tested this script on an ubuntu VM running on my own machine by sshing into the machine from my host OS and running the script and it functions as expected. What happens on the EC2 instance is, however, unexpected. It would seem that the interface is brought down and the instance becomes unreachable, but I'm never able to connect to the instance again. I have dumped the output of the script to a text file on my EC2 instance and it would appear that the script finishes execution and neither ifconfig command returns an error. I have also noticed varied behaviour from the ec2-describe-instance-status
 command as well as the EC2 web console. Most of the time, after running the script and confirming that I cannot reach the instance the instance status shows that both the system and instance reachability status is ""passed."" That said, I have seen on two occasions that it showed the expected instance reachability status of ""failed."" I've tried running the script using several methods; in screens, using cron, just from the shell... they have not had any impact on the behaviour described above. Does anyone have any insight, suggestions or sage advice on this issue? If so I'd be appreciative if you could share it.

Hello Ravi,

I did check your account and could find the following m3.large instance in your account -  i-467d34b9. So, I assume that you are talking about this instance.

Did you notice processes appearing in an Uninterruptible Sleep (D) State in the top or ps -ef command outputs? A quick look on your instance's could watch metric indicates that your instance root volume is running out of IO credits. Since your instance root volume is only of 8 GB size, it will get restricted to a base performance of 24 IOPs (3 IOPS per GB x 8 GB) and your instance is trying to push more IO operations to the disk which could create this issue. You can verify this by looking at the QueueLength of your instance's root volume in the CloudWatch Metrics console.

You can either use a root volume of bigger size which will effectively increase the base IOPS rate for the volume and also will have longer burst periods and shorter IO credit accumulation period.

The point is, no one knows the IP before except us because it is only used for test by ourselves. So it is definitely not because of domain/IP banned.

Hi reactivestudios,

Can you confirm if you are still having issues connecting to the web from within your instance?

I had a look at your SG and ACLs and for the most part they look okay. You could do with cleaning up some of the rules. As an example I see a rule which locks down 3389 to a single address but then another rule for 3389 for 0.0.0.0/0 which leaves it wide open. 

If you continue to experience issues I would suggest opening up your ACLs and SG to 0.0.0.0/0 and then test for web connectivity. After you confirmed web connection you can then go through and harden your SG/ACLs

Can I reboot the server before the maintenance window to clear the event?

Here is the email notice shown below:

Dear Amazon EC2 Customer,

One or more of your Amazon EC2 instances is scheduled for maintenance on 2015-06-29 for 2 hours starting at 15:00 UTC. During this time, the following instances in the us-east-1 region will be unavailable and then rebooted:

  i-a474efdd

Your instances will return to normal operations after maintenance is complete and all of your configuration settings will be retained. To continue normal operation and avoid any unavailability or reboots during this time, you can migrate the instances listed above to replacement instances. Replacement instances will not be affected by this scheduled maintenance. Otherwise, no action is generally required on your part (certain underlying system components may change at reboot time, and your operating system may prompt you to install additional software/drivers post-reboot as a result). If your instance is part of an auto-scaling group, then it will automatically be terminated and replaced by a newly launched instance during the maintenance window.

You can see more information on this maintenance in the AWS Management Console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-east-1#s=Events.

Additional information about maintenance events, including how to migrate to replacement instances, can be found at http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-instances-status-check_sched.html.

We perform maintenance regularly to ensure that the EC2 service continues uninterrupted for our customers. In most cases, maintenance can be performed without service interruption. When maintenance cannot be performed without service interruption, we work hard to keep any impact as brief as possible.

I found out the issue. I'm using a setup where I have a gateway server attached to a public subnet that all other servers (attached to a private subnet) use to route external traffic.

Amazon EC2	"Cannot access EC2 instance with Public IP
I'm trying to understand the VPC complexity. I am following the instructions in Amazon's ""VPC Getting Started Guide"". But at the end, I don't have connectivity to my machine. I need help.

I used the VPC wizard to create a default VPC. I verified the VPC has the internet gateway configured in the secondary route table. 

I then spun up a new Windows instance (i-a2dfcf54). The instance uses my shiny new VPC. I created an elastic IP and associated it with the instance. Now there is a public IP address for the instance. The security group for the VPC is using the default settings which are wide open.

The machine is up and running. It has a public IP address. Is using the new VPC and subnet. The subnet says its using the route table with the internet gateway (i.e. 0.0.0.0/0). But I cannot connect using RDC or even ping the machine. (It is not a problem with my laptop's firewall or local router as somehow I was accessing a machine yesterday. I decided to start from scratch today).

Hi,

Does Amazon plan to support the ""VM Generation ID"" standard that Microsoft published for Windows 8/Server 2012 (and, backported down to XP SP2 when using Hyper-V Tools)?

VMWare ESX 5.1 and Workstation 9.0 support this as well, as does Xen, based on patches between February-April 2013, but I don't see the appropriate ACPI VM_Gen_Counter information in the namespace (so the driver doesn't load). It is critical for correct cryptography an AD behavior on virtualized instances, in order to deal with rollbacks/snapshots, so I am hoping that this is just a case of AWS not yet having picked up the most recent Xen upstream changes...

Hello,

We apologize for the confusion here. It had taken place due to the way marketplace checks the eligibility for free-tier, which is initially just based on the instance type. However, later when you hit the higher space requirement it threw the error. The engineering team has replied to us with the following confirming the above, 
""For now the free tier eligible badge is only accounting for free tier eligible instance types. we have plans to expand the badge to account for other dimensions, such as EBS volume sizes.""

This means you are facing the well known 2012 R2 issue:

In order to recover the instance, please first stop it and change the instance type to either a C3, R2 or I2 instance type first.
Then please:
1. Create an AMI as a backup of your instance
2. Start the instance again
3. RDP to the instance
4. Run the provided script to remediate the issue:

Amazon EC2	"Re: I can not connect to my instance EC2 windows server 2003.
Hi Luiz,
I see the instance is stopped, so I can't do a live troubleshooting.
By checking the old logs I have, I see the instance was failing the instance health check, and the network layer didn't initialize.
This could be caused by many reasons, and I can't understand which one if the instance is stopped.

If you can't leave the instance running my advice would be to create a new instance and then migrate the data.

EBS volumes can be moved from an instance to another as long as they are in the same availability zone.

Amazon EC2	"How do you import an ESX Windows Server 2012R2 image into EC2 using BYOL?
I previously posted this thread with some questions about importing VMs.  I have since solved all problems except BYOL.  I thought a more specific question (now that I only have one) with more detail would be more productive.

I have followed the AWS instructions for UsingImportImage to import an ESX exported image of Windows Server 2012R2 -- using the BYOL flag.  I followed the VMImportPrerequisites setup instructions (necessary but not obviously linked to from ""UsingImportImage"").  I uploaded the image to an S3 bucket, and created an import-image task with a command like this one:

aws ec2 import-image --cli-input-json ""{ \""Description\"": \""Windows 2012R2 OVA\"", \""DiskContainers\"": [ { \""Description\"": \""Win2012R2 Import Task\"", \""UserBucket\"": { \""S3Bucket\"": \""my-bucket-name\"", \""S3Key\"" : \""Path/To/2012R2Image.vmdk\"" } } ], \""LicenseType\"": \""BYOL\"", \""Architecture\"": \""x86_64\"", \""Platform\"": \""Windows\"" }""


The command completed successfully.  I used ""aws ec2 describe-import-image-tasks ..."" to follow the status until it completed.  I then found and named my new AMI (no obvious sign anywhere whether or not BYOL was enabled).  At this point, I launched a new instance from this AMI with dedicated tenancy, as is required for BYOL.  (I verified that the instance got dedicated tenancy.  It did.)  I logged into the instance and checked the license key with ""slmgr -dli"" and compared to the output from another EC2 instance that was a Windows Instance selected from the ""Quick Start"" tab in ""Launch Instance"" and to the output from the original instance in VMWare.  It's pretty clear that my attempt to use BYOL failed.

At no point was there any indication of failure.  No complaint, no warning, no failure.  Is there a hidden or undocumented step one must do to get BYOL working?  Do you need to reach out to AWS support and get a feature enabled?  (I tried and it doesn't seem like that is the case.)  Any suggestions?  If I did something incorrectly, how do I figure out which step?  Again, at no point was there any complaint."

Amazon EC2	"EC2 instance unreachable/unrebootable while Status check OK
Hello there,
I'm experiencing trouble with an EC2 instance (i-e856a1ad) that gets unreachable by SSH and un-rebootable from EC2 console while both System Status Checks and Instance Status Checks are green.
It already happened before and the only way to get it up again was stopping it then launching it again. 
The instance runs celery workers with supervisord and when the instance gets unreachable, I can see that the workers stop consuming tasks, along with CPU usage diminution to a value very close to 0  (see attachement).
Do you have any clues where it comes from and why the 'Stop' action works and not the 'Reboot' action ?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: EC2 instance unreachable/unrebootable while Status check OK
Hi kunteng,
A reboot is equivalent to a software reboot. It could be that due to the instance conditions (CPU, memory utilization), the OS can't actually reboot.
The stop action can be enforced (if you try to stop twice for example you can force the stop), and that may solve some temporary issue due to resource consumption or OS deadlocks.

You can check the System logs to see additional information about the OS state:

http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-console.html

Additionally, you can check Cloudwatch metrics, to see for example if CPU utilization is high.
At the moment, I don't see any particular issue with the instance.

Sorry to see you are having issues expanding the root volume for your instances.

I was able to reproduce the problems that you are seeing using the community AMI.  I also tested this with an Amazon AMI image and the partition resizes to the defined size automatically.

I was able to find a work around to get you the extra disk space that you need on the community AMI.

1.	Deploy the instance, without adjusting the disk size.
2.	“STOP” the instance once you have verified you can login to it.

Amazon EC2	"How can i set up Joomla on EC-2? Please, help!
Hi!
My name is Igor, I woold like to install joomla on Amazon EC-2 Ubuntu server free tier, but I could not do this.
After a week of probe and tests I deside to write you. This letter I send to Amazon and Ubuntu help. 

All settings are from official ubuntu site.

What did I do:

1. Set up right settings for Shh port (If not to do this, connection will be first and last time)
   Link on instruction - https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/openssh-server.html

sudo apt-get install openssh-client

sudo apt-get install openssh-server

chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys

2. Programs packages installing before joomla install
   Link on instruction - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Joomla

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get upgrade



sudo apt-get install apache2 php5-mysql libapache2-mod-php5 mysql-server php5-json phpmyadmin php5-curl unzip

// New password for the MySQL ""root"" user // PASS_1

// Password of the database's administrative user // PASS_1

// MySQL application password for phpmyadmin // PASS_2

Failure, writes that:

Processing triggers for libc-bin (2.19-0ubuntu6.6) ...
W: Operation was interrupted before it could finish



So I deside to reinstall packages one by one.

Delete all packages:

sudo apt-get purge apache2 php5-mysql libapache2-mod-php5 mysql-server php5-json phpmyadmin php5-curl unzip

Install all packages one by one:

sudo apt-get install apache2

sudo apt-get install php5-mysql

sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5

sudo apt-get install mysql-server

sudo apt-get install php5-json

sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin

// Password of the database's administrative user // PASS_1

// MySQL application password for phpmyadmin // PASS_2

sudo apt-get install php5-curl

sudo apt-get install unzip

Failure, that was before doesn't repeat. 
So I go further.

3. Joomla install
   Link on instruction - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Joomla

SOURCEPKG=Joomla_3.1.5-Stable-Full_Package.zip
SOURCEWWW=http://joomlacode.org/gf/download/frsrelease/18622/83487/Joomla_3.1.5-Stable-Full_Package.zip

mkdir joomla
cd joomla
wget $SOURCEWWW
unzip $SOURCEPKG
rm -f $SOURCEPKG

cd ..
sudo mv joomla /var/www/
cd /var/www/joomla
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data .

cd /var/www/joomla/
sudo find . -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
sudo find . -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;

mysqladmin -u root -p create USER_1

// Password of the database's administrative user // PASS_1

mysql -u root -p

GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, INDEX, ALTER, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES, LOCK TABLES ON USER_1.* TO USER_2@IGOR_HOST IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

\q

Successes, go further.

4. Change joomla files. 
   Link on instruction - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Joomla



sudo nano libraries/joomla/filter/input.php

Failure.
Nano opens file, but it's empty.
There is no text, only black background and commands in bottom part.

So I go another way.



I change text in file through Filezilla.

I download file /joomla/filter/input.php
Find:

$source = preg_replace('/&#(\d+);/me', ""utf8_encode(chr(1))"", $source); // decimal notation
$source = preg_replace('/&#x(a-f0-9+);/mei', ""utf8_encode(chr(0x1))"", $source); // hex notation

Chfnge on:

$source = preg_replace_callback('/&#x(\d+);/mi', function($m){return utf8_encode(chr('0x'.$m[1]));}, $source); // decimal notation
$source = preg_replace_callback('/&#x(a-f0-9+);/mi', function($m){return utf8_encode(chr('0x'.$m[1]));}, $source); // hex notation

Allso I change folder rights for joomla folder to make downloads on server.

sudo find /var/www/joomla -type f -exec chmod 777 {} \;
sudo find /var/www/joomla -type d -exec chmod 777 {} \;

Download new file on server. 
After that do everything as in insrtuction:

sudo service apache2 restart

Unfortunately after all this steps I do not see joomla site on this link
http://ec2-52-7-84-123.compute-1.amazonaws.com/joomla/installation/index.php

It writes:

Not Found
The requested URL /joomla/installation/index.php was not found on this server.
Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu) Server at 52.7.84.123 Port 80


I allso try:

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get upgrade

cd /var/www/joomla/
sudo find . -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
sudo find . -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;

Does not help. 

Please, help me to solve this problem with EC-2 Ubuntu Server 14.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type - ami-d05e75b8
As you can see I did everything as written on Ubuntu official site, but I have no result I hope to.

Thanks for posting. Looking at the instance and volume vol-85584fc2 I can see that starting at 03:39 UTC on 06/24 the volume was being throttled. Currently the volume is starting to accumulate burst credits.

The reason your credits had become exhausted was due to writes issued to the volume starting at 21:37 UTC on 06/23/2015. This peaked at 03:43 UTC on 06/24/2015 at which time throttling began.

Amazon EC2	"Re: How is the fingerprint of EC2 key pair calculated?
This is a confusing topic for the best of us.  Amazon could really do a lot more to make this easier for us all.

I have now edited much my original posting as it didn't fully solve the problem. Other posts to thread in the past year have not fully solved the problem either.

The best I have yet is:

Install ec2-api-tools

then

ec2-fingerprint-key .ssh/key.pem  (path to your private key / key name) ,

this will show you the fingerprint of your desktop private key which you can then compare to the public one shown in the web-based management console, under key pairs. They should match but it is not very convincing as a solution. 

The reassurance that this match is in use has to come from being told this fact at the point of instance launch. When you initially log on to your new instance the fingerprints will remain consistently different to those reported elsewhere ...

'ec2-get-console-output'  which some people have suggested, may be used prior to to initial accecptance of fingerprint authenticity and will show output in other than ECDSA.  I haven't been able to get this to match the ec2-fingerprint however.

@Daniel  'openssl pkcs8 -in ~/.ssh/ec2/primary.pem -nocrypt -topk8 -outform DER | openssl sha1 -c'  explains the mechanisn that aws appears to use but produces exactly the same results as the much simpler 'ec2-fingerprint-key'

There really must be a load of people out there just crossing their fingers and clicking 'yes' ....

As in: The authenticity of host ' can't be established.

ECDSA key fingerprint is xxxxx....  Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

I previously suggested:

ssh-keygen -l -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub   (exactly as is)

You can also add:

ssh-keygen -l -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub

A year on,  although I thought this solved the problem, it doesn't.  It is just a variant on 
'ec2-get-console-output'  except you have trusted the connection to find this out.

Amazon EC2	"Re: How is the fingerprint of EC2 key pair calculated?
The 'ec2-fingerprint-key' command only works on the private key, not the public key. As an Ops guy, I only have the public keys of my users, not their private ones.

I want to calculate the fingerprint of a public key the same was Amazon does it. Any ideas?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: How is the fingerprint of EC2 key pair calculated?
I wanted to do the same thing and finally figured out how to do this without using the EC2 CLI tools (and Java) and using OpenSSL instead.

If ~/.ssh/ec2/primary.pem is a private key generated by EC2 itself, the following will give you the fingerprint in the same format as displayed by the EC2 API:

openssl pkcs8 -in ~/.ssh/ec2/primary.pem -nocrypt -topk8 -outform DER | openssl sha1 -c


Also note that you're creating a fingerprint/digest of the private key (the first command essentially just converts the private key from PEM (text) to DER (binary) format). The consequence of this is that you can't verify the fingerprint of such keys unless you have the private key. You can however re-import such keys under a different key name into EC2, and then treat it like a key generated outside EC2. This is obviously not very convenient though.

If ~/.ssh/ec2/primary.pem is a private key generated from which you created a public key and imported that into EC2 (and thus end up with a shorter finger print in EC2), then you can use:

openssl pkey -in ~/.ssh/ec2/primary.pem -pubout -outform DER | openssl md5 -c


Here we actually implicitly create the public key from the private key in the first command (-pubout only pipes the public key), and then create the fingerprint from the public key. Consequently if you don't have access to the private key, you can still create the fingerprint:

openssl pkey -pubin -in ~/primary.pub.ssl -pubout -outform DER | openssl md5 -c


In the above command ~/primary.pub.ssl was created with:

openssl pkey -in ~/.ssh/ec2/primary.pem -pubout > ~/primary.pub.ssl


Note that the only way to distinguish between the two schemes is the length of the fingerprint (sha1 is longer than md5).

Credits for the solution to the EC2 created keys go to: http://journal.soffritto.org/entry/231 (from which I gleaned enough to see the solution), and fingerprinting a public key was just a bit more fiddling with the helpful hint about md5 in the comments of http://blog.jbrowne.com/?p=23.

Hope that helps.

Amazon EC2	"Re: How is the fingerprint of EC2 key pair calculated?
I have some questions about the keys used in AWS.

How can I find the finger print from my private key PEM file?

Having the values differ kind makes the information there useless. I see I could use the API tools, but what about if I want to view the fingerprint on my local machine? Can I install the API tools there? Even if I can that still makes the process a little more complex, it would be nice if I could do this without having to install anything and just use standard tools.

I have two keypairs, but only one I used. When I tried to create my first AWS server in Virginia (the default, for me anyways) it didn't work so after a while I cancelled it and made a server and  keypair somewhere else. I think I still have the PEM file for Virginia on my work PC. If I ever lose the PEM file is it possible to download it again, or can you only download it when generating?

If I made a new instance in another region and want to use the same PEM file I use for my current instance I notice I can import the public key part of the pair, so that's good, maybe I'll just delete the Virginia keypair, or I could just not use it and hold on to it if I ever decide to change my keypair or need for something else.

EDIT: To add more confusion I just imported my key to another region and the fingerprints for the two regions are different, is this because a salt was added? I thought I could use the fingerprints to check that the key matched for different regions.

As far as I know, there's no way to directly decrease the size of a snapshot.

You could create a 35GB volume (from the snapshot) and a 30GB volume (empty), attach them both to an instance, and copy the data over. Then you would be able to create a snapshot from the 30GB volume.

Hello

I have successfully connected to the SSH port and also opened the website. However, if you require the ability to ping this IP you need to add the ICMP protocol to the security group. You can choose to allow all ICMP traffic or you can choose to limit ICMP to only reply to pings by choosing Custom ICMP and then selecting Echo Request from the available options.

The error ""no route to host"" was most probably caused by your ISP or an upstream provider. To test this you should run a traceroute from your local system to the public IP of your instance and note where the link is down.

Amazon EC2	"Re: elastic ip unreachable sometimes
Hello
There are many potential causes for this problem and the most effective method to troubleshoot this is to work through this by process of elimination.

To start you need to get as much information as you can about the link between you and the EIP.  An effective tool to use in this scenario is MTR:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTR_%28software%29
When you again experience this issue of the IP address being unreachable run MTR from your local system to the EIP and log the results. 

The results will show you if there was any packet loss and where this occurred if any. 

After you have ruled out a connection issue, you need to start troubleshooting the instance itself. You need to ensure that the instance is not running out of resources like CPU or memory or that you are using more IOPS on the instance volume than what they are capable of. You can use a combination of CloudWatch and OS tools like TOP in Linux to obtain these metrics."

Amazon EC2	"Linux RAID and root device
Hello,

In a linux instance, is it possible to put all filesystem (all volumes, including ""root device"") inside RAID1 arrays (e.g. /dev/md0 => root device + volume1; /dev/md1 => volume2 + volume3 ...) ?

Regards"
Amazon EC2	"Re: Linux RAID and root device
Hi there,

As I understand Linux itself can't boot from a RAID device. The boot partition needs to be on a block device. Have you ever configured a Physical machine or VM in this way before?

Potentially, if you really wanted, you could start an instance with say 3 volumes. Once it's running, join the 2 data volumes in RAID1. Copy the root volume onto the RAID array. Edit your fstab to mount /boot to the first block device (/dev/sda1?) and mount / on the RAID device.

This is quite challenging territory though, and ultimately unless you have a very specific use case, this approach isn't really cloud architecture friendly. You should aim to spread your workloads across multiple instances, such that if one fails, the other provides availability. 

It doesn't really add up either if you need it for performance. AWS EBS volumes can be upto 16TB do 20,000 IOPS on a single volume. EBS volumes are already durable and data is replicated across multiple servers. Plus you can take snapshots and AMIs. More info on durability here

http://aws.amazon.com/ebs/details/
Amazon EBS Availability and Durability

Finally, with a RAID array, if a volume fails, replacing it and rebuilding the array is not going to be trivial. Lets say you attach a replacement volume, but automatic recovery doesn't kick in correctly and there is some kind of problem. You do not have console access like you do on a normal physical machine to do recovery type steps.

Perhaps others in the AWS community can provide some insight into the pros and cons and configuration steps, but unless you have an extremely good reason for wanting this config it is not recommended.

Julian H."

2. Look into when these problems occur, and see if it correlates with high CPU Utilization/Memory utilization. Web services also generally have connection limits, you may want to also examine your application logs and configuration to see if you see these connection attempts failing. 
3. Traceroutes, preferably at least one for when they're failing and one for when it's succeeding.

I would like to know if a latency spike observed for 'backend_processing_time' can be caused by the client side instead of the backend? More specifically, if an incoming HTTP request to the backend server is a POST request with additional data to send in the request body, does the latency start ticking before the client finish sending the additional data? As the backend needs the complete request before it can respond, that may increase the latency."
Amazon EC2	"Re: ELB latency (backend_processing_time): Client side latency possible?
Hello, 

I generally wouldn't call this 'client side latency', as the latency is still being measure as how long it takes for the backend instance to start it's reply. In the case of file uploads like a large POST, yes, you'd see a spike in the ELB's latency metric. Another common cause of latency spike that the client may influence is in GET or POSTs that cause the backend instances to send a large database query that takes some time significant time to return.  

In these cases still, the ELB Latency metric still measures the how long it takes from when it forwards the request to when the first part of the return data is received.

Hello, 

It sounds like there could potentially be an issue with the OS or perhaps some application. Most commonly application issues that will cause a problem like this will occur when installing network drivers, tampering with network or permission settings, or installing security software. 

Two things you can additionally check if you're still having this problem:   
1. System log of the instance, by going to Services -> EC2 -> Instances -> Right click on your instance -> Instance Settings -> Get System Log. This will show you the console output of your OS and you may see that your OS is restarting or encountering some errors. 
2. Additionally, you can further investigate your OS/SSH logs (generall within /var/log) by detaching your root volume and attaching it to an instance that is working. The following article goes more thoroughly into this:

My htaccess is set to redirect all traffic to index.php where we load controllers and models... etc etc.

Looks like this:

RewriteEngine On

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-l

RewriteRule ^(.+)$ index.php QSA,L

Any clue on this?

Amazon EC2	"Cannot SSH to ec2 instance, or ping it
Trying to learn AWS. 
So I read over the docs and watched a recent youtube video on how to get a instance up and running....seems trivial!

So I do the following steps:
1.  in EC2; Launch Instance
2. pick AMI 2015.03 (HVM)
3. use default settings and create a new .pem key, I save this key to my machine
4. I wait for the instance to be up and running for a bit.
5. I chmod 400 the .pem key
6. I try to ssh to the machine in the following format:
ssh -i aws-ssh-only.pem ec2-user@x.r.t.y 
where x.r.t.y was the IP given the instance.
--> no response.
Then i try the Public DNS instead
-> no response.
7. I add HTTP to the security Group and try to ping the machine:
-> no response.

8. I asked some friends who use AWS all the time, they watch me walk through the steps and they also 
see nothing I'm doing wrong.  They think my account is messed up.

9. I called Amazon Billing Support, they say my account is in the clear and to post here instead.

My current public IP/DNS is:

Hi  Charles,

I had a look at your instance and it looks fine. Looks like you forgot to add an Internet Gateway (IGW) to your VPC and or enable it.

Is it odd that the first time you have to set this up but then in the future it auto-chooses the VPS that has an internet gateway...after reading the docs it's not that odd.

When you get a chance could you provide links to the docs you referenced. As an example our getting started with VPC does talk about IGWs - http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/GettingStartedGuide/GetStarted.html

--> I even read the line: ""EC2-VPC Check the route table for the subnet. You need a route that sends all traffic destined outside the VPC (0.0.0.0/0) to the Internet gateway for the VPC.""
And mentioned this possibility (but perhaps in the wrong words) to one of the people helping me but they dismissed it.  I think the link you provided was much better than this short blurb. 

Perhaps would be nice to have a Prerequisites about having a Internet Gateway here on your VPS route, or perhaps I should read docs better.

I kind of don't like how it auto makes all this VPC stuff for you on the fly (routes/VPS/etc) but then you still actually have to go into it to set a Internet Gateway.

I think from just playing around with a few instances (micro free teir) i ended up createing unknowingly like 20 subnets
prob 10+ VPC?  etc etc

Amazon EC2	"Re: Did I find a blackhole router inside EC2 in Singapore?
Hello, 

I don't show that 52.75.65.179 is currently in use on your account, but generally the instance type determines the available MTU. You can read more on supported MTUs per instance type here:
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html

Additionally, the OS itself can configure a lower MTU as well. If using an older AMI on a newer instance type it could potentially have an MTU manually set to something smaller. You can verify MTU settings with 'ifconfig' in linux and in windows it 'netsh interface ipv4 show subinterfaces' should do the trick. 

Let me know if you have any additional questions.

Note that the instance MTU is actually less than 1500, despite the recommendation to set 1500
Also, security policy is set to allow all ICMP messages

""Path MTU Discovery is used to determine the MTU between two hosts. If a host sends a packet that's larger than the receiving host's MTU, the receiving host returns the following ICMP message: Destination Unreachable: Fragmentation Needed and Don't Fragment was Set (Type 3, Code 4). This instructs the original host to adjust the MTU until the packet can be transmitted. By default, security groups do not allow any inbound ICMP traffic. To ensure that your instance can receive this message and the packet does not get dropped, you must add a custom inbound ICMP rule to your security group.

I only have  this problem with machines coming up in Singapore. Not the other places (yet).

I can leave this useless instance up, in the hope you can check it out, however it is a spot instance so is liable to be torn down at any time.

However, I think above is enough information anyway?
a) The instance MTU is less than 1500
b) 1480 size Packets can't reach it 
c) No must-fragment messages are being passed to clients of the machine, and no fragment messages are getting to the machine otherwise it would reduce its MTU
d) ICMP security policy is totally open

Amazon EC2	"High steal time on m3.medium instances in us-east-1 AZ's
We are experiencing high ""steal time"" on m3.medium instances in us-east-1 AZ's.  This usually varies between 8-12% which is much higher than the corresponding value on m1.medium instances in the same AZ's.  However, from 1225 - 1315 (Central) time today, steal time values were intermittently over 40% causing applications to fail.  

Is AWS addressing this issue (high steal time on m3.medium instances)?  Is there any explanation for today's very high steal time?  Would we be better off moving to m3.large instances or back to m1.medium instances?  We were forced to deploy additional m1.medium instances to remedy the issue."
Amazon EC2	"Re: High steal time on m3.medium instances in us-east-1 AZ's
Hello Barchartinc,

To address your question on Steal Time, please see the below explanation:
On-instance monitoring tools such as top report a metric of Steal Time (ST), or Stolen CPU. Top and tools that use similar methods of gathering performance metrics will report your instances usage of the physical cores on the host, and not just the instance itself. Any time the instance requests more than its allocated share, you will see the ST metric above zero. This does not mean you are not getting the resources allocated to the instance, but that your instance is requesting more resources than it is allocated to that particular instance size.

There is an excellent article which describes the stolen time metric in detail, and what it means here: http://www.axibase.com/cloud/2010/07/22/ec2-monitoring-the-case-of-stolen-cpu/

The variations in instance stolen CPU time for different instances or in different availability zones  is due to various hardware and customer configurations. Depending on the number of other instances on a single piece of hardware and the specific CPU on the hardware, stolen time will show varying amounts, but this does not speak to the capacity of an ECU.
ECUs are explained in more detail here: http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/#What_is_an_EC2_Compute_Unit_and_why_did_you_introduce_it

To answer your question on whether upgrading your instance type will help, you may look at your CloudWatch metrics and verify the average CPU load. If you see that it is constantly peeking or running ""hot"" continuously, upgrading your instance may solve the issue.

Regards
Darren R"
Amazon EC2	"Re: High steal time on m3.medium instances in us-east-1 AZ's
Thanks for your response.

Per Darren's direction, I am now looking at the Cloudwatch metrics.  The issue is that there is a considerable gap in CPU usage between the m1.medium instances and the m3 instances that are running as part of the same web farm.  The m1 instance in zone east-1d peaked at 46% today while all of the m3 instances peaked at about 62% (the m3 instances seem to all have very similar performance).  Zone east-1c shows a similar gap.

We also brought up an m3.large which seems to be performing well.  At this point, we will have to convert our m3.mediums to m3.large instances and change the reservations and hope that the m3.large's do well under load.  m3.mediums are performing worse that m1.medium instances with the exact same application / configuration.

We thought that using m3.medium instances would result in improved performance, but so far that has not been the case.  Is there a step that we missed in switching the instance type from m1.medium to m3.medium that would impact performance?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: High steal time on m3.medium instances in us-east-1 AZ's
Hoping for further information in regard to the poor performance of m3.medium instances vs. m1.medium instances.  I have attaced cloudwatch monitoring graphs demonstrating the difference in CPU usage (which was also reflected in application performance) between the m1.medium and m3.medium instances.

We noticed there was a problem because the day after converting from m1.medium to m3.medium instances, our application started experiencing very high latency / non-response.  In order to work around this, we added two additional m1.medium instances to each of our 3 zones.  This increased the number of instances in each zone from 6 to 8 (total instances increased from 18 to 24) and the application response significantly improved.

For comparison, I looked at the following instances when they were all part of the application (approximately 2014-02-19 4 PM Central - 2200 UTC to 2014-02-20 12 PM Central - 1800 UTC)
m3.medium i-836015ad
m1.medium i-aeb8eb80
m3.medium i-1f58303e
m1.medium i-c0bcffe1
m3.medium i-3bd9e91b
m1.medium i-9e7e70be

The first screenshot (m1.medium-v-m3.medium.png) is from 2014-02-20 when I had both m3.medium and m1.medium instances (i-836015ad and i-aeb8eb80) running off the same Elastic Load Balancer.  The instances were running with identical configurations / applications.  The web app is php 5.3 and apache 2.2 based, nothing unusual.  As you can see, the CPU usage is markedly higher on the m3.medium instance.  The second screenshot (m3-v-m1-aggregate.png) shows all 6 instances listed above for 2014-02-19 4 PM Central to 2014-02-20 12 PM Central.  The 3 highest CPU usages are for the m3.medium instances.

Has anyone else experienced similar rise in CPU usage and drop in performance when converting from m1.medium to m3.medium instances?  Comparisons of the idle% (sysstat) on each of the instances shows the same pattern -- significantly higher CPU usage on the m3.medium instances.  I did not attach that documentation but can make it available.

Last, converting the instances to half the number of m3.large instances solved this, i.e., the same application runs very well on 9 m3.large instances but very poorly on 18 m3.medium (in each case spread over 3 zones behind an ELB).

Thanks for any insight."

We are also seeing this behavior - high CPU steal time in an m3.medium instance, when the CPU utilization % is not above 50%. Also in the US-east availability zone.

For comparison, I spun up an m1.medium instance from the same image as the m3.medium, and the m1 is showing under 1% steal time.

The m1.medium has 2 vCPUs, or 1 less than the m3.medium, so that's worth noting.

My application is Wordpress, with a separate RDS instance for the database, in case that's meaningful.

Steal time == LUCK!!

In the ""cloud"" (sharing hardware), we never know when a co-tenant might suddenly get a deluge of traffic, roll out broken code, schedule their maintenance tasks to run, or whatever.

Amazon, please correct me if I'm wrong, but I suspect you guys actively do your best to manage this by throttling offenders after reasonable burst timeouts, issuing warnings, managing capacity, and so on. 

But it doesn't change the fact, we're still sharing hardware here people. 

We can increase our chances of predictably low/zero ST by --

1) Getting a bigger instance (even when we shouldn't need it); or 
2) Choosing a less busy data centre (hacker haven Palo Alto seems particularly bad in my experience, surprise surprise);

Or alternatively, we can work around it --

3) Run in a distributed/clustered fashion, so a single node spiking isn't an issue
4) Go bare metal with another provider, nice n simple and we've only got ourselves to blame then

Amazon EC2	"""running"" but unreachable--how to access console?
I am running a SLE instance. I moved all my services and data over to EC2 and was cleaning up some stuff, when I noticed a kernel security upgrade was available so I installed it and rebooted. Now the instance shows ""running"" but I am unable to ping it and the web console shows 1/2 status so I guess it is stuck somewhere before runlevel 3.  Maybe it is stuck at GRUB?

Is there a way to access the VM console directly? I don't see the option anywhere but I can do it with VMware so figure its worth asking

I have backups on the 2nd volume so I can restore from those if needed but would really like to find out if its possible to get boot console access

Amazon EC2	"Re: ""running"" but unreachable--how to access console?
Hello ehall,

I'm sorry to hear you're having problems with your instance.  Unfortunately, there's no way to interact with an EC2 instance via the ""console"".  

In your position I would stop the instance, detach the root volume and attach it to another working instance as a secondary volume.  You can then mount the volume and begin tracing through the system logs for clues as to why the instance fails to boot.  More information on detaching and attaching volumes can be found below:
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-detaching-volume.html

Hello abovebeyond14,

It's possible to produce a list of volumes with the following CLI command:aws ec2 describe-volumes --region us-west-2 --query 'Volumes[*].{VolumeID:VolumeId}' --output table

You can add a tag to a volume with this command:aws ec2 create-tags --region us-west-2 --resources vol-a1b2c3d4 --tags Key=MyTag,Value=TestTag

Essentially following http://blog.backslasher.net/resizing-aws-root-centos-hvm.html

I've done these steps successfully for several disks, but I've encountered a unique issue that I can't overcome. When I boot the attached disk (attached to /dev/sdf...also tried /dev/sdp), the next boot of the instance loads the secondary image I want to resize instead of its primary which is mounted to /dev/sda1.

I've tried multiple mount points for the secondary disk, and multiple helper instances, but I keep getting the same result. Anyone seen this before?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: During HVM root partition resize, instance boots into wrong disk
Found explanation here:
https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=110608

Essentially- using the same AMI leaves the root partition with the same UUID, which can cause it to boot the wrong disk since they both have the same UUID. Tried granting a new UUID to the volume and updating fstab, but it broke it. Work around is to boot it up as a secondary from a server built from a different AMI. Not pretty, but it works."

Amazon EC2	"Can no longer log into EC2 instance
Hello All.

We had a linux instance that had been running for at least a year without an issue.  I was last able to log on on Friday, May 22, 2015 and updated some content on the server without an issue.  I tried to log on on Wednesday of last week and wasn't able to log on.  It wasn't recognizing my key and asking me for the passphrase for my key.  It hadn't done that in the past and the machine I was ssh'ing from hadn't updated the ssh client.

I've tried getting into several other machines of the same age (with the appropriate key for the given machine) and they all exhibited the same behavior.  I tried standing up a snapshot of the vm that I cannot get in, and was unable to log into that.  

I was able to get into VMs  that I created from the quick start ami instances without an issue, but I had to use the ec2-user.  I did have to use the root user to log into all those other instances.  Could that be the problem?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: Can no longer log into EC2 instance
let me understand right ... ec2-user@ fails but root@ lets you in?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: Can no longer log into EC2 instance
No.  Sorry I was unclear.  My old VMs only had the root account.  There is no ec2-user instance on my old machines.  When I try to log into my old vms with the root user account that worked in the past, I get ssh returning and asking for a passphrase for the key.

On the quick start instances that I was able to log into, only the ec2-user account worked.  root login was not allowed, which is to be expected due to changes that amazon instituted."
Amazon EC2	"Re: Can no longer log into EC2 instance

In looking at the logs the shutdown was at 10:36 and the startup begin at 10:46. Seems like a LONG delay ... I wonder what was happening during those 10 minutes."

Amazon EC2	"EBS stuck on attaching
Hello,

I know there's a bunch of related topics, however we can not find a reliable solution. 

Our platform uses EBS backed instances with several data volumes (EBS) attached. The idea is if the instance fails for some reason we preserve user's data and move the volume to another instance.

When an EBS volume gets stuck on 'Attaching' after certain timeout we use Force detach and after some time we try again. This unfortunately does not help.

We tried different timeouts (hours) and different EC2 instance types - no result. The volumes are small - 2GB.

The problem appears between certain EBS volume and certain instance:

if we attach the problematic volume on another machine it works
if we attach another EBS volume to the problematic machine even on the same device name it works


We don't use more volumes than the OS and the instance type permit. We always manage resources in sequence (no parallel locking) and leave certain time between different operations.

Please advice how we can avoid such problems.

Thanks,
Alex"

Amazon EC2	"Re: Network going down randomly over the last week.
Hi there verodynamic,

Looking at the details of your instance I notice that the CPU credits for this instance have dropped to 0 3 times in the past week. This would be the most likely reason that you are seeing the issues that you are experiencing.

Looking at the load of the past week and the instance type that you are using I would recommend that you upgrade to t2.large as that might fit your load pattern better.

For more information on the T2 instance types and the bursting attributes please see the below link


http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/t2-instances.html


Going a little more high level however I would recommend that you change the architecture of your workload to be more suited to running in the cloud. As you currently have 1 instance running your website you have a single point of failure. When designing workloads for the cloud it is better to use a loosely coupled approach with with redundancy.

In this case the first thing that I would recommend that you do is put your website behind an Elastic Load Balancer setup with Auto Scaling. Splitting your load up to various T2 instances will allow you to run smaller instance types while achieving a good level of redundancy.

For more information on this service please see the below link

Amazon EC2	"System Clock on Windows 2008 Server Instance runs fast
I have several Windows 2008 R2 SP1 instances running in a VPC. Their Instance Types are m3.mediums in most cases, with a couple of production servers running c3.xlarge or c3.2xlarge. One of the m3.medium instances has a system clock that will resync to time.windows.com each day and then begin to run fast until, after a few hours, the time is four or five minutes ahead of all the other system clocks in the VPC. And by the next time it resyncs, it may have gained 15 minutes or more.  

I don't see where there is a configuration problem. There are no utilities or services running on this server that are different from my other servers that might be messing with the clock.  On the other servers, the time might be fast or slow by a few seconds, but that does not affect the operations between the servers, which rely on timestamps. Most of what I see on other forums suggests that this behavior could indicate a hardware problem.  So, two questions: Is there anything I can configure/check on this instance to make it keep time correctly? If not, do I have to rebuild the server on a new instance to address any underlying hardware problems or is there something simpler?"

Hi there vangap,

I have checked both your instances and they are indeed both not running. This limits the networking information that I can get from them, but I do have some general guidance for you.

I have looked at your VPC and I can confirm that you have both DNS settings enabled for your VPC. Looking at the other running instances I can see no issue with the networking config either.

What you would want to do differently though is not use .ap-southeast-1.compute.amazonaws.com for internal private resolution. Instead you would want to use .ap-southeast-1.compute.internal

If you go to your AWS Management Console you will be able to see both the private and public DNS names for an instance. As the private DNS name is based on the internal IP it will not follow the ec2- format that you have provided, instead it will be ip-

If you check your console this should become clearer, and in case it is not please see the information in the below link.

If you are having SSH connection issues when connecting to your instance in your own VPC (non default) check the following:

1 - Ensure you have an Internet Gateway (IGW)
2 - Ensure this IGW is associated with your VPC
3 - Ensure you have a route added for the subnet that the instance resides in that routes traffic out of AWS, such as 0.0.0.0/0 via IGW
4 - Ensure the Security Group allows the correct port from the source your are trying to connect from (which you have already done)
5 - Ensure the Network ACL also allows the ports through the network of your Subnet that your instance resides in

Amazon EC2	"Re: Slow network
Hi there tingwo,

In future please create a new thread for your issue instead of continuing a thread that has been dormant for a long time so we can better respond to new issues.

I have checked your instance and I can see that it would be beneficial for you to perform a stop and start on the instance to move it to different underlying infrastructure. Once this has been done please test again.

If you are still getting issues that it would be best to start looking at your instance configuration. I see that you are currently running a C1 instance type in EC2-Classic. There are several things that you can do to improve your situation.

Firstly you can change your instance type. The equivalent current version of the C1 instance type is the C3. Performing this change will save you money. The hourly rate of your current instance would be $0.148 per hour. Changing to a c3.large would cost $0.120 per hour while giving you the below benefits

""C3 provides features not available on C1 and CC2 such as Enhanced Networking. Cluster networking is also available on C3, as well as a wider availability of EBS-optimized instances sizes.

Compared to C1 instances, C3 instances provide faster processors, one additional instance size, approximately double the memory per vCPU, and SSD-backed instance storage. In addition to these features, C3 instances also have the best price/ECU compared to all other Amazon EC2 instances.""

For more information on these differences please see the below link.


http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/previous-generation/


Other than changing the instance type I would also recommend that you migrate this instance from EC2-Classic to VPC. This will enable access to the current version of enhancements but also any future  EC2 enhancements.

Migrating to VPC would be specifically beneficial for your situation as you would be able to take advantage of the Enhanced Networking feature. Below is a short description of this feature and a link to more information.

""We currently support enhanced networking capabilities using SR-IOV (Single Root I/O Virtualization). SR-IOV is a method of device virtualization that provides higher I/O performance and lower CPU utilization compared to traditional implementations. For supported Amazon EC2 instances, this feature provides higher packet per second (PPS) performance, lower inter-instance latencies, and very low network jitter.""


http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/#enhanced-networking


To enable enhanced networking please see the information in the below link.


http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/enhanced-networking.html


Another feature that would help your situation is EBS-Optimized instances. Again below is a description.

""An Amazon EBS–optimized instance uses an optimized configuration stack and provides additional, dedicated capacity for Amazon EBS I/O. This optimization provides the best performance for your EBS volumes by minimizing contention between Amazon EBS I/O and other traffic from your instance.""

For more information please see the below link.


http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSOptimized.html


For information on how to migrate your instance to VPC please see the below link.


http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/vpc-migrate.html


If you require further help on this situation, my advice or details on how to implement it feel free to create a support case using your AWS Support Management Console.

Amazon EC2	"Re: Removing an VPC instance public IP address
Hi,

The configuration of whether or not to assign a public IP address by default, is controlled by the VPC subnet setting.  You may modify the subnet to not auto-assign public IP's when launching instances into that subnet.

Please see Link: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-ip-addressing.html#subnet-public-ip for more details on how to change the configuration of your VPC.

Note You can't manually disassociate the public IP address from your instance after launch. Instead, it's automatically released in certain cases, after which you cannot reuse it.  See Link: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-ip-addressing.html#vpc-public-ip

Amazon EC2	"ELI5: Lost in the Acronyms - Help Please
Hello everyone.

As you may have already understood from the title, we're more than a little lost and would really appreciate some help and understanding on what I need to do to achieve our goals.

Ok so here's hoping someone here can help:

We've setup our EC2 and hosted our application on the system (Running windows 2012). After a little poking around and experimenting (mostly shooting in the dark) we've managed to set the UDP/TCP ports correctly, add the elasticIP and managed to successfully run our application (hosting). The client software can then connect and we have managed to get several clients connected...

So far so good...

Next we want to be able to provide access to some specific in-house files that contain our data that our client application can connect to and retrieve (download only). In order to achieve this we need to provide an IP address and path to the files hosted on the EC2? This is where we have run aground...

How exactly can we host files on the EC2 and get some fixed path to it that our client software can use? 

Example: TheIPAddress/path/somewhere/files.txt

These files would typically be stored relative to the path of our server application but it is not essential. 

We did manage to host a simple html file on S3 but I think this is a blind alley as there does not appear to be any relation to the S3 and the EC2 (Not something obvious to us anyway)

While we are pretty tech savvy people with good programming skills, we just can not get our heads around it and to add to our suffering all the tutorial googling we do just seems to dig us deeper into confusion. 

If someone can help us with some step-by-step aka ELI5 you could really help ease our pain and frustration. 

Here's hoping...

Amazon EC2	"Re: ELI5: Lost in the Acronyms - Help Please
phreakzoid,

It sounds like the issue you are having is related to IIS / your web server configuration, not necessarily EC2/AWS. An EC2 instance at its most basic concept is simply a server. What you choose to do with it is up to you.

(I am making the assumption that you have an EBS volume (persistant hard drive) attached to your EC2 instance)

You could use S3 for storing those files if they are relatively static (think of S3 as a ""dropbox"" of sorts, works kind of like a hard drive concept wise, but you wouldn't want to use it as an actual hard drive)."
Amazon EC2	"Re: ELI5: Lost in the Acronyms - Help Please
Thanks for the reply lorenzoaiello, I think I understand what you are saying in terms of S3 and dropbox as an example. 

If EBS means that on the EC2 Windows box we have access to a hard drive where we store physical information, then yes you are correct. We remote desktop in and install files including our .exe which when running allows clients to connect to the IP and port range...

I presume there is some way to make the S3 bucket point at our EC2 instance at a specific place?

In other words: how can I make an address on the S3 point to the EC2 folder/file? I will dig around there in the meantime maybe I will figure it out. In the meantime if you can point me at any reference materials or tutorial on how to connect the two it would be most helpful.

Thanks again, I really appreciate your help"
Amazon EC2	"Re: ELI5: Lost in the Acronyms - Help Please
You can't make S3 ""point to"" an EC2 instance; they're independent services.

If all you need to do is host static files, the easiest thing to do is just upload them to S3. If it's important that the files are actually served from your EC2 instance, you'll need to install a web server on your instance and configure it to serve the files. The details are outside the scope of this forum (it's a general system administration issue, not anything specific to EC2) but you can get started by looking at the documentation for your preferred server software e.g. IIS, Apache or Nginx."
Amazon EC2	"Re: ELI5: Lost in the Acronyms - Help Please
Thanks David, that cleared things up for me. I was trying to connect the S3 and EC2 together and searching for how-to-do was like looking for a needle in a haystack... In this case with no needle to be found. I think we can host the data on S3 as I expect the application running on the ec2 could use the same URL to get the data. 

Thanks to both, I believe we are good to go now."

I would start by checking the following:

1 - Ensure you have an Internet Gateway (IGW)
2 - Ensure this IGW is associated with your VPC
3 - Ensure you have a route added for the subnet that the instance you are trying to connect to resides in. This route will need to read as follows 0.0.0.0/0 via IGW
4 - Ensure the Security Group allows the correct port from the source your are trying to connect from (22 for SSH, 3389 for RDP)
5 - Ensure the Network ACL also allows the ports through the network of your Subnet that your instance resides in
6 - Ensure you have assigned an EIP to the instance
7 - Ensure you are using the correct EIP address to connect

Thanks for the response. I've created the VPC a few times both with the wizard and manually. As far as I know I've checked all the items you mentioned. Thanks for the list.  I am very familiar most of the items with and have checked. However, I'll go through the list and check again.  Flow logs show that the login request is getting to the instance, but the return path could be a problem.

YAY! Turns out it was the source on the inbound rule of the security group. The ports were OK, but for some reason the source value was set to the name of the security group rather than a subnet.

Amazon EC2	"EC2 instance cannot send response to client
Hello there,

I am using a t2.micro instance to serve requests to a front-end hosted on S3. Interestingly enough, 90% of my users can get a response. However, there are 10% who just can't get any response back. Some of these users are in an enterprise environment.

I had the chance to check one of my friend's Chrome dev tool (using on our front-end) and saw a weird behavior where no response was sent back. Then, I sent a get json request to the endpoint directly. From there onwards, everything started to work. Recently, a potential early adopter from an enterprise tried our prototype and same thing happened again. This time, I wasn't so lucky and got a good lecturing from the user.   

I tried searching online for tons of possiblity. I can only come up with 2:
( i ) Some firewall blocks response sending back from EC2 addresses (I am not using Route 51 yet to attach our domain name yet)
( ii ) There is some sort of routing issues to be address

If you think that these are good reason for what's happening, please let me know what can I do to fix them. Otherwise, what are the debugging steps that I can take?

Amazon EC2	"EC2 Spot Instance requests not being fulfilled
I'm unable to get any EC2 Spot Instance requests fulfilled. I made a request for a Windows g2.2xlarge instance. Frustratingly, the Spot Instance request has been endlessly bouncing between 'pending-evaluation' and 'pending-fulfillment' Statuses for over an hour. My bid price is well above the historical and current market rate.

I just created a new AWS account that is separate from my business' account, since this is for a personal project. Are my spot requests ignored because my account is young?

Amazon EC2	"A few questions about importing Windows VMs into AWS
I have figured out how to import a Windows Server 2012R2 64 bit server from VMWare into AWS, and have successfully completed an import using ec2-import-instance.  I have a few questions that so far Googling and perusing the docs I cannot find any help for

1) How do I indicate that this is a BYOL server?  And how can I (as an IAM user) verify the license setting BYOL vs Amazon-supplied?  I've found text to this effect ""To Use your own Windows license, when importing the VM image, you must use the BYOL flag with the LicenseType parameter"" in several places, but the ec2-import-instance command has no LicenseType parameter.

2) How do I import as a dedicated instance?  The instance was created as a ""default"" Tenancy instance.  It looks like once an EC2 instance is created, you cannot change its tenancy.

3) How do I control whether or not a public IP is created?  I would like to put the imported VM into a specific subnet, and it looks like if I do this, the instance cannot be assigned a public IP unless I specifically give it an Elastic IP.  (I tried that and it worked, but it's not what I want to do.)  Is there any way to assign a public IP (that is not an elastic IP) to an EC2 instance that wasn't created with one?

The docs I primarily referenced are:

http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/UsingVirtualMachinesinAmazonEC2.html

http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ImportingYourVM.html

http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/CommandLineReference/ApiReference-cmd-ImportInstance.html

Is there a different way of doing this that allows me to specify BYOL, usage of auto-generated public IP, and dedicated tenancy?  For now I'll terminate the instance I imported."
Amazon EC2	"Re: A few questions about importing Windows VMs into AWS
I figured out the answer to everything except BYOL.

There are two different sets of web pages describing how to import VMs, describing two very different ways of doing it.  One uses ec2-import-instance.  That's the one I used a couple days ago and it's pretty straightforward.  Apparently, that way of doing things cannot achieve what I want.  The other way of doing things uses the AWS CLI and is documented at:

http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/UsingImportImage.html

This is far more complicated, requiring much more configuration and work and more steps.  You have to create an IAM role and give it policy before you can do the import (as described at http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/VMImportPrerequisites.html which doesn't seem to be referenced from the UinsgImportImage.html pages so you have to discover it by chance).  I got this working (following the steps at the web page above) and it created an AMI.  I was able to launch the AMI as a dedicated instances.  So now my remaining question is about the BYOL license for Windows.  I've done everything one is supposed to do to enable this and it doesn't seem to be working."
Amazon EC2	"Re: A few questions about importing Windows VMs into AWS
I've asked a follow-up question with more detail at the following thread in this forum:

https://forums.aws.amazon.com/message.jspa?messageID=633768#633768

that question describes in more detail what I have tried, the commands I've used, how I have tried to verify things.  I thought since I have just one remaining question -- about BYOL -- it would make more sense to have a thread specific to that one question."

Amazon EC2	"Re: AWS Data Transfer out beyond the global free tier principle
800 GB, that sure is a surprising amount if you weren't expecting it.  The ""data transfer out"" typically means data being downloaded.  Do you have large files that get downloaded, either by yourself or by visitors / users?  Or did you run some large file copies over the Internet during the billing period?

If none of these ring a bell, you may be able to check your server logs to see the source of the traffic.

Occasionally this can even be caused by a hacker who gains access to your servers and then uses them to conduct high-traffic activities."

Are you trying to copy the password once it has been decrypted from the web page? I have had issues when trying to issue copy/paste commands like this before. Please try to just type the password into the dialog box for your password, please note it is case sensitive. Also, verify that the administrator account it is trying to use is not part of a different domain. 

You can also try to launch the RDP program with a console session to Windows. To do this you will need to run this command in your command prompt – mstsc /console

If the AMI creation is still stuck, you can stop the instance and start it back. Stopping and starting the instance will place your instance on a different physical host. You should then be able to perform the AMI creation of your instance. Also stopping and starting the instance will clear your instance from the maintenance activity as your instance will get moved out of degraded physical host on which your instance is currently running.

Hi,

We have had this happen to us.
This is a seperate problem to the infrequent DNS lookup problem that can occur with RDS - which seems to be related to the low TTL of those records.

Sometimes the DNS service for an instance becomes unstable. In our case, a few hours after the problem started our instance started to fail instance checks too. Assuming you are using EBS and not ephemeral storage, try stopping and then starting your instance to move it to new hardware. That should cure it."
Amazon EC2	"Compute Credits Zero Out Randomly
I have an EC2 t2.Small instance that I use to run a process every thirty minutes. The process takes between 120 and 200 seconds. It runs fine most of the time and then every once in a while (maybe once a day) it takes over 1000 seconds to complete. When this happens I notice that my Compute credit balance is zero even though they are routinely at or near the 30 credit mark (which is the starting point for t2.Small). Even more surprising is that when I look at compute credit usage, it is always just a few credits each run (not anywhere close to the balance). I turn the machine off and on between runs because under certain conditions I use a different size instance. When I start the instance if was previously at a high level but it seems as though after I start it, the credits are zero.

Any thoughts in this? Why would my balance randomly zero out when my usage is fairly constant and my compute usage is relatively low. I would hate to bump up the machine for something random."
Amazon EC2	"Re: Compute Credits Zero Out Randomly
Hello,

CPU credits are not preserved between stop-starts of an instance. When an instance is stopped, its CPU Credit balance is completely discarded and the next launch will obtain the default number of CPU Credits for that instance type provided it's within the limit on T2 launches per 24-hour period (100 by default). For a t2.small instance, it will start back up with 30 credits minus any CPU credits consumed by CPU utilization during the OS starting up. If you're frequently stop-starting your EC2 instances, you may be better served by an instance class that doesn't use CPU Credits so that you have a consistent baseline performance level that you can rely on for your application.

You can read more about how CPU Credits work in our documentation on the T2 instance class here: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/t2-instances.html#t2-instances-cpu-credits"
Amazon EC2	"Re: Compute Credits Zero Out Randomly
Understood but if I have something that runs every 30 minutes (24 x 2 = 48 stop/starts per day) what would be causing my dramatic drop (to zero) in my credits when I never use more than a couple on each run? I also have a t2.micro which runs once an hour for 8-10 minutes. It runs a very consistent amount of time to process my data.

I chose the t2.Small because it should be more than enough in terms of compute credits. Ideally I would move to an c4.Large but I am a small (startup) business and am just trying to prove my concept so I can start generating some income. I'll try some tests using the c4 to see if that will work more consistently.

Thanks for the clarification on the max start/stop on a t2. I wasn't aware of that limit."
Amazon EC2	"Re: Compute Credits Zero Out Randomly
Hi,

I have a very similar problem. My CPU credit went from 500 approx to about 50. I couldn't understand why, then I read the document on how CPU credits are calculated and realised it was because I rebooted my instance.

I understand that credits won't be maintained if the instance is switched off but surely they should be maintained or possibly reduced at a faster rate while an instance is being rebooted or temporarily switched off.

This is really annoying, as I was in the middle of an operation and now I'll have to leave it running doing nothing to regain my credits before I can continue working on it.

Please can someone from Amazon have a look at this. I've attached an image of the CPU credit graph.

Thanks"
Amazon EC2	"Re: Compute Credits Zero Out Randomly
As an alternative suggestion why don't you use a non t2 instance type for this workload?

I feel that if you have to spin up the instance and leave it running for longer to accumulate credits, it would make more sense to use a slightly more expensive instance type that doesn't have CPU credits and go back to starting it for 30 minutes when you need it."

What does they mean? 


15GB upload/download 
Regional Data Transter? What does that mean?

Amazon EC2	"Re: See bandwidth usage for Free Tier Usage
The Regional Data Transfer charge applies to data transferred between instances in different availability zones within the same region. Each instance you launch is placed in a specific availability zone. If you launch multiple instances in different zones and transfer data between them on the internal network, you will be charged for any data transfer exceeding 1 GB per month. As you only use a single instance, you don't need to worry about this right now.

All data transfer in to your instance is free of charge. You only pay for data transfer out of your instance in case you exceed the 15 GB included in the free tier. It doesn't matter where you are located.

You can enable billing alerts from the Account Activity page. It is possible to set up alarms for the total estimated charges as well as specific services. The system will automatically send an e-mail when you cross the defined threshold."

Amazon EC2	"Re: See bandwidth usage for Free Tier Usage
Because they are charged for the capacity of the pipes they maintain to the outside world, not how much they transfer; and as they host servers they're always going to be sending more data than they are receiving. Inbound is therefore ""free"" to them, so it is free to you as well."

Somehow, it looks like the instance itself broke, and the volume is fine. No matter what volume I mounted to the unreachable instance, it remained unreachable. This led to me believe there was an instance problem, not a volume problem.

Amazon EC2	"System Time Keeps Resetting to 5 Minutes Slow
I have a Windows server in EC2 that keeps resetting its time back to about 5 minutes slow.  When it's 2:10 PM on all my other computers and our other EC2 servers, it is 2:05 PM on that server.  It is set to synchronize with time.windows.com (the default for a new Windows install).  If I force it to sync, I see the time jump back to the correct time, but a few minutes later the time will jump back to 5 minutes slow.

This is causing API calls that require a timestamp to fail, impacting the operation of the server.

I think this is a problem with the underlying hardware.  Whenever the time resets back to the wrong time, it is accompanied by an entry in the system log like the following:

The system time has changed to ‎2015‎-‎06‎-‎18T18:48:03.500000000Z from ‎2015‎-‎06‎-‎18T18:53:38.663690100Z.

Change Reason: System time synchronized with the hardware clock.

Any ideas on how to resolve this without taking the instance out of service to try to start back up on different hardware?  Can I disable the sync with the hardware clock, since the server will already sync w/ an NTP time server anyway?  (The two appear to be fighting, setting the system time forward then backward each time one syncs)."

Amazon Linux AMI release 2015.03

ip-172-31-16-79 login:"
Amazon EC2	"Re: Error Log has ""failed to execute '/lib/udev/input_id""
Thank you for reporting this issue.

What's happening is that the initramfs prepared by dracut contains udev rules that refer to the input_id helper program, but does not contain that program.

This is harmless, though the error messages are distracting. We'll look into a fix."
Amazon EC2	"Instance unaccessible after upgrading to 2015-03 version
After running ""sudo yum update"" to install the latest version, my instance became unreachable.

Instance ID: i-888611ba

The error message was ""FATAL: kernel too old"", it seems to related to Kernel ID, but I don't know which Kernel should I use after upgrading.

Anybody can help me?

Thanks."
Amazon EC2	"Re: Instance unaccessible after upgrading to 2015-03 version
In the documentaion, it said

Use the following procedure:
    Stop the instance.
    Modify the configuration to use a newer kernel.
    Start the instance.

But I don't know which newer kernel I should use. I tried some, but none of them worked for me. Plus there are hundreds of kernel IDs to choose from, and a lot of them have very similar or the same names. 

There should be a better way to find the correct AKI."
Amazon EC2	"Re: Instance unaccessible after upgrading to 2015-03 version
I had the same issue a couple of years ago.
From my experience, the fastest solution is:


Stop the instance.
Start another, fresh instance
Attach a volume created from snapshot from the root volume of that old instance to the new instance
Copy over missing configuration and files
Use your new instance from now
Terminate your old instance"
Amazon EC2	"Re: Instance unaccessible after upgrading to 2015-03 version
Hello, tabbsta,

Thanks for your sharing your experience. 

I guess it's doable. 

However, If this is the only way to do it, I will be very scared of using AWS EC2 from now. 
Luckily, the instance that is experiencing this problem is one of our slave server. I cannot imagine what if our production web server have the same problem. 

It has been for 2 days, and my instance keeps being unreachable.

No AWS guy can help me in the forum?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: Instance unaccessible after upgrading to 2015-03 version
Don't how I marked it as answered or who marked it as answered."
Amazon EC2	"Re: Instance unaccessible after upgrading to 2015-03 version
I followed  tabbsta's instructions. It seems that is the only way to do it."
Amazon EC2	"Re: Instance unaccessible after upgrading to 2015-03 version
Your custom AMI specifies an AKI that maps to an older Ubuntu 2.6.32 kernel. Most likely during the update you pulled in a newer glibc which requires a more recent kernel; this is a build time option for glibc.

If you are using the Amazon Linux AMI repositories, note that in 2015.03 we changed our glibc build to enable features that require a 2.6.35 kernel, which corresponds to the earliest version of the kernel that we've shipped.

I agree that the AKI selection process is rather opaque. Fortunately, for nearly all customers there is a much better solution: use the PV-GRUB AKIs whenever registering a PV AMI. This allows the instance to manage the running kernel, instead of hard-coding a particular version to be used.

The PV-GRUB documentation here should help you find the correct AKI:
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/UserProvidedKernels.html

When applying OS updates, it is very common for the GRUB configuration to be updated automatically to point to newly installed kernels. So in most cases you should be able to stop an existing instance, change the AKI to the correct PV-GRUB AKI (either 32-bit or 64-bit), and start the instance again."
Amazon EC2	"Newbie Question - Losing my Temporary Data (Obviously)
Hi there,

Apologies - I'm sure this question has been answered before, but the answers I found were a little too technical for me.

Just spun up our org's first server - first time I've used AWS. It has been working well so far, but I'm having issues with how the memory stores certain things. I have 30 gigs of 'stable' storage which survives an 'on/off'. Only problem is that this is almost entirely full - about 2 gigs space having bought te server yesterday.

There is also 80 gigs of temporary storage - but anything I save here dies after an 'on/off', which for our purposes is completely useless.

Am I doing something wrong? Have I spun up the wrong type of instance?

Thanks,"
Amazon EC2	"Re: Newbie Question - Losing my Temporary Data (Obviously)
Hi,

Permanent storage needs to be saved onto EBS Volumes, which is what your 30GB sounds like you have.  The instance you have selected probably has the Operating Systems installed on this volume so you need to bear in mind that actual usuable storage for this instance might not be as much as you thought. 

You can either create another EBS Volume and attach to your EC2 instance, or select a larger instance with a larger volume size.  However if you dont need the additional processing power of a larger instance then it might be cheaper to just add an additional volume.

The below may help:
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-creating-volume.html
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-attaching-volume.html

Amazon EC2	"d2.xlarge incompatible with RightImage Centos AMIs?
Editing as I've solved this. d2 instances won't launch with the instance-store backed amis I was trying - the EBS-backed amis worked though.

Choosing d2.xlarge (or d2.2xlarge) with RightImage CentOS 6 community AMIs, the instance fails to launch, with
State transition reason:  Server.InternalError: Internal error on launch

I've tried with a few different AMIs, in both eu-west-1 and us-west-2, always with the same result. An example eu-west-1 AMI I've been trying is RightImage_CentOS_6.6_x64_v14.2.1_HVM - ami-4f3da238

This is a 64-bit, instance-store backed, hvm virtualized ami, which I think ticks all the requirements for d2 instance types, but I can't get it to launch, nor find any meaningful error message to assist me in diagnosing the problem. Any thoughts or insights as to what the problem might be?

To view the additional volume you have attached to your instance, you need to mount it first.

1) Check how your Operating system has detected the volume you attached.  Sometimes your instance does not detect your attached device as what you specified in the ec2 console.
$ sudo lsblk

2) Mount the volume, for example if device has been detected as /dev/xvdf

Amazon EC2	"Ping VPN client via OpenVPN-AS instance
Hi everyone

I have set up a VPC with the network address being 172.31.0.0/16. I have two EC2 instances running.

1. App Server: 172.31.31.28
2. OpenVPN-AS: 172.31.19.144

The OpenVPN-AS server accepts VPN connections and provides them with a dynamic IP address in the network 172.27.224.0/20.

My clients are able to connect with the OpenVPN-AS server and from the VPN server, I can ping the VPN client. The first attachment shows the ICMP request and responses on the VPN client and as you can see, everything works correctly.

But what I want is connect/ping from the App Server (172.31.31.28) to the VPN client. This is not working. I added a new rule in the route table of the VPC that all the traffic with destination 172.27.224.0/20 is routed to the OpenVPN-AS server. I also disabled the source/dest check on the VPN server. When I ping from the App Server to the VPN client, the requests are received by the client but the client is dropping the requests as you can see in the second attachment.

Something I noticed is that when I ping from the OpenVPN-AS server, the source of the requests is the IP of the as0t1 network interface, being 172.27.232.1 which is an IP within the VPN network 172.27.224.0/20. When I ping with the App server, the source of the requests is the internal IP of the server in the VPC, being 172.31.31.28. Is that the reason why the packages are dropped? Because the client does not know where to send the responses to?

Thanks in advance!

Sam"
Amazon EC2	"Re: Ping VPN client via OpenVPN-AS instance
I managed to solve the issue thanks to Sebastien Stormacq of Amazon.

So, the problem was the the VPN didn't seem to know the route to the internal network 172.31.0.0/16.  The solution ofcourse is, make the client aware of the network by adding that network to the routetable of the client. It seems that a VPN server is capable of pushing routes to the client. In a OpenVPN Access Server, this is done by navigating to the `VPN Settings` page and add the internal network to the `Routing` section (see attachment).

The problem was that it still didn't work so far. When I looked in the logs when my client was connecting, it tried to add the network to the routetable but couldn't because of permission issues. When I ran the client software in administrator mode, it was able to add the correct routes and it worked.
