Amazon CloudFront	"How to cache files forever using Cloudfront?
I'm serving a Github pages site over Cloudfront.

I'd like to have all javascript and css files cached forever, so I set a new behavior rule, with the pattern `js/*.js*, and for the object caching, I set a TTL of 31536000.

But, according to google page speed insights, i'm still only seeing a TTL of 10m on /js/app.6ce7c83d.js and js/chunk-vendors.b4c237e0.js

Any ideas what I'm doing wrong? The behavior rule for js files is at the top of all other rules, with precedence 0.

Amazon CloudFront	"Origin Access Identity alongside AWS Signature Version 4
Given a Cloudfront instance acting as a web distribution for an S3 bucket, what's the recommended approach to a public GET, authorised PUT?

Is it possible to use a combination of Origin Access Identity and AWS Signature Version 4?

Origin Access Identity for GET, unsigned, requests
AWS Signature Version 4 for PUT, signed requests based on a IAM user.


As far as I can see, once a Cloudfront Distribution uses ""Restrict Bucket Access"" with an Origin Access Identity, it is solely responsible for creating ""AWS Signature Version 4"" signed requests to S3."
Amazon CloudFront	"CloudFront Logs Not Writing To Desired S3 Bucket
I have several CloudFront distributions and two S3 buckets. The buckets were intended to be for ""non-production"" and ""production"" logs everything works great in non-production, but the logs will not write to the production bucket.

If I modify the ""production"" distros to write logs to the non-production bucket, they are producing logs and everything works fine.

Looking at the Permissions tab on each bucket they appear to be identical.  But there must be something I'm missing. I don't see any relevant IAM policies but I'm assuming there is something else.

Any ideas where I should look for permissions or other issues?

Amazon CloudFront	"CloudFront distribution creation time ... 20ish mins normal?
Recently I have been playing around with CloudFormation templates for a project. As part of this I've noticed that CloudFront distributions are taking 20ish mins to be created/updated. I know they are not intended to be 'instant' but this seems on the extreme of what is expected (i've seen reference 'up to 15 mins').I've selected Price Class 100 in attempt to reduce the number of locations that CloudFront needs to provision but this seems not to have helped. 

Is it simply CloudFront taking a long time to propagate or is there anything I can do with the setup of CloudFront distribution to make this step faster?"
Amazon CloudFront	"Re: CloudFront distribution creation time ... 20ish mins normal?
That is normal for CloudFront.  There's nothing you can do to decrease the time."
Amazon CloudFront	"Re: CloudFront distribution creation time ... 20ish mins normal?
Whenever I add a cname to my distribution it takes 15 minutes to be seen in my laptop but in my cellphone it is shown instantly and both devices are in the same LAN. How come? it should take 15min for all devices in the same network right."
Amazon CloudFront	"Re: CloudFront distribution creation time ... 20ish mins normal?
The behavior of the CloudFront distributions taking long time for deployment is normal. CloudFront delivers the content through a worldwide network of edge locations that provide low latency and high performance.

The time it takes is for propagating the changes in configuration like certificates, origins, settings, etc to all the edge locations so that changes take effect everywhere. The changes are not propagated to every edge location instantaneously.

Until the configuration is updated, CloudFront continues to serve your content from that location based on the previous configuration.

It is unfortunate that we can't determine whether the given edge location is serving the content based on previous configuration or the new one."
Amazon CloudFront	"CloudFront + Lambda - availability of GEO/Device headers in Viewer Request
Hi,

We are using CloudFront events for A/B testing, and specifically, Viewer-Request event to insert a cookie (A or B) in order to get the right cache version.
Lately, we decided to take it another step and make a decision based on Country/Device in order to avoid un-necessary cookie insert and improve our cache stats (if A/B testing not relevant for the US for example, there is no reason to insert a cookie and divide the cache version even more).

We faced a problem since the Country/Device headers don't available on this event (Viewer-Request). We found that a bit strange because the cache is based on Country/Device, so it makes sense that those headers will be available while we manipulating the request through the Lambda function.

There is any future plan to make those headers available?"

I get the following error:

Still having this issue, though when I try my request from a different box (the first was on a mac) I get a different failure:

An error occurred (SignatureDoesNotMatch) when calling the PutObject operation: The request signature we calculated does not match the signature you provided. Check your key and signing method.


The same request works from both boxes when I use the standard s3 endpoint, so I still think this must be an issue with my cloudfront configuration.

Amazon CloudFront	"Re: Virtual hosting an S3 bucket using Cloudfront + SSL
The issue was: The client signs the request using the custom domain; but then when S3 gets the request from CloudFront it expects the request to be signed for s3.amazonaws.com, not the custom domain.

Resolution: Depending on the client you use, you might be able to set the custom endpoint after the request (and signature) is created. See https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/issues/826#issuecomment-247651352 for an example.
Unfortunately, this is not possible with the Java SDK. Our solution will be to either write a wrapper around S3's Java Rest SDK, or:
Skip CloudFront altogether and use an nginx proxy instead with a configuration that includes something like:
proxy_set_header    Host mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com"

Amazon CloudFront	"Routing S3 and API Gateway through CloudFront
Hi, I have been attempting to setup a CloudFront distribution like so:

https://example.cloudfront.net > S3 Bucket
https://example.cloudfront.net/api > API Gateway

Currently I am experiencing issues calling the API Gateway. I have added the origin domain name as example.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com (taken from the API Gateway invoke URL after deploying it) and I set the origin path as the API Gateway stage name (which I set as /test). In the cache behavior settings I have added the path pattern as /api/* and selected the origin. Because the api uses POST methods, I have selected the appropriate allowed http methods. Everything else is set to default.

Under the current setup as described above, when I use an API Tester to call https://example.cloudfront.net/api/test/methodName I am currently receiving this:
{""message"":""Missing Authentication Token""}

To clarify, the API Gateway is working fine when calling it using the same setup but changing the invoke URL provided: https://example.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/test/methodName to https://example.cloudfront.net/api/test/methodName

The authentication token should be specified in an HTTP header. Make sure that the behavior has Forward Headers set to All so that all of the headers are passed on to the origin."

In these current tests I have turned off authentication in my API Gateway methods.

""The request could not be satisfied.""
""This distribution is not configured to allow the HTTP request method that was used for this request. The distribution supports only cachable requests.""

I find it interesting that the response above states that it only supports cachable requests, but when you turn on ""All"" for ""Forward Headers"", a warning box appears under ""Object caching"" saying that ""CloudFront does not cache your objects"" (see screenshot).

Maybe I should use a Whitelist for ""Forward Headers""?"

Amazon CloudFront	"When will CF support true Origin Shield?
I am wondering if there is a good reason why Amazon CloudFront has not implemented some resource to select a single pop as an origin shield so that other pops can fetch from it, instead of the origin. This is a critical feature to assure all assets are the same across all pops. It appears that virtually all other CDNs offer this in some fashion or another:

https://www.cdnplanet.com/guides/origin-shield/ (see chart)

I understand there is already a Regional Cache feature, but this is not the same in that: 
1) I cannot pick a pop that is closest to my origin to act as primary.
2) Users in different regions or those without a regional cache will get different versions of the same assets depending on when and where they are loaded.
3) If my origin goes down, only users within a regional cached area will be unaffected.

Perhaps there is some complexity that I do not understand here, but at least if I could specify CF to only offer a single pop, I could set two distros up (one as the shield and the other as a global cdn). 

I appreciate any insights.

Amazon CloudFront	"Conditional ""Restrict Bucket Access"" using Lambda function?
Hi,

We have a requirement where we want to ""Restrict Bucket Access"" for some S3 request paths, but not for others. Unfortunately there are around 10,000 paths for which we want to allow access to the requested content without signed cookies being sent, and 250,000 where we want to insist upon them. We obviously can't therefore set each of these paths up with their own CloudFront behaviours.

I'm therefore thinking of using a Lambda function, but don't have much experience of them. I think what we'd need to do is as follows:

1. Set the lambda function up to be called as part of the viewer request, i.e. when the request enters CloudFront.
2. If the request has been sent with CF signed cookies then let it be processed as normal, as per the corresponding CF behaviour, with the signed cookies being checked by CF.
3. If the request hasn't been sent with signed cookies then the lambda function would call an API to get a list of the paths for which signed cookies aren't required. If the request path matched one of those paths then the request would be processed as per the corresponding CF behaviour, but without the ""restrict bucket access"" requirement, so they could be given the object even though they didn't send signed cookies.

It's worth noting that ideally the lambda function wouldn't be continually making those API calls. Ideally it would cache the API response for a period of time, but not sure whether Lambda could do that.

Is this feasible? If so any relevant docs would be hugely appreciated."
Amazon CloudFront	"Packet Loss
Hello,

I am seeing extremely slow image loading when using CloudFront with S3. The images load faster without CloudFront, but that significantly increases our bandwidth costs.

Here is a sample waterfall: https://i.imgur.com/yRQhmr3.png
tracert shows massive packet loss: https://i.imgur.com/MpORE1l.png
tracert with VPN disabled: https://i.imgur.com/tEa9d8S.png

I have confirmed from others in other geographic locations that they are encountering packet loss as well. Could this be the culprit?

Amazon CloudFront	"403 error with Cloudfront setup
I set up static S3 website buckets and created certificates.
Then I tried to add CloudFront, but I get a 403 error.

I turned on logging for the static bucket and didn't see an error.
What else can I do to try to see what is wrong?

Amazon CloudFront	"Migration of live service from one CF dist to another
I'm sure this is a FAQ but can't find anything in Amazon docs or the internet.
We're using CF as the front end for our web application with a route 53 record alias pointing to it (root apex mydomain.com)

When we develop a new version we use cloudformation to create a complete setup fronted by CF (test.mydomain.com).  Once tested we'd like to promote that to live (so requests to mydomain.com go to it) by pointing the route 53 record alias to it.  In this way we can revert to the old distribution if anything goes wrong.

However we can't have multiple distributions with the same cname (mydomain.com) - is there anyway around this? or alternative approach.

Thanks for any help"
Amazon CloudFront	"Not able to apply AWS Certificate
I would like to create a static S3 site.
I've set up the S3 buckets and applied for an SSL certificate.
The certificate was successful and is marked as Issued but not in Use.

In CloudFront, I am setting up a distribution and it asks for the SSL certificate.
I want to use a custom domain name and associate the certificate that I created.
The option ""Custom SSL Certificate"" is grayed out.

What have I done wrong?"
Amazon CloudFront	"Error Updating Cloudfront Distribution to include Whitelisted Headers
We have a distribution that we are trying to include a couple of whitelisted headers.  Currently, the headers are set to ""*"".  When we update this setting to specify headers and save, we get an error.

We keep getting the below error message: 
error updating CloudFront Distribution (XXXXX): InvalidArgument: The parameter CNAME contains one or more parameters that are not valid. status code: 400""


We have the same configuration working in a separate account for our test environment.  When we attempt to update in this separate production account (separate account from test), we get this error. 

Updating the values manually in the console results in the same error.  Console steps:
    1) select ""Default"" behavior on distribution
    2) set ""Cache Based on Selected Request Headers"" to whitelist
    3) add a value from ""Whitelist Headers""
    4) click ""Yes, Edit""

Any ideas?
