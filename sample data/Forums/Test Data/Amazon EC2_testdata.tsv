Amazon EC2	"Spot Request Terminated - Says I initiated the action, I DID NOT
Just had a pretty critical spot request terminate. The event type is given as ""fleetRequest_Cancelled"" implying I manually requested that the spot request be cancelled. I DID NOT request that this spot request be cancelled. 

I have also confirmed that the spot price did not exceed my max price, as my max price is set ABOVE the on-demand price. Furthermore I have the exact same type of instance on the exact same availability zone setup with the exact same max price which HAS NOT terminated. It is still running.

I need to know why this happened and how to prevent it in the future. This particular spot request was pretty important and had we not been taking snapshots and have a fresh image ready to go we'd be up crap creek, so to speak.

The spot request I.D was sfr-4d937268-aed5-4556-9dac-1df7fb4a32cf
The instance I.D was i-0272c3f5e4ffd5b4a

Amazon EC2	"Amazon CloudFront + Lamba + KMS issues
Hello,

I am encountering issues with Amazon KMS when decrypting a URI string - it works for some people and for others it does not work. I have been debugging it for the past 2 days and I just can't seem to resolve it. I will explain the set-up we have implemented below:

EC2 Server - the server is based in Europe (London)

CloudFront - we have a CF server with a Lambda function associated to it. The CF event is ""Origin Request"" and the ""Lambda Function ARN"" is only allowing from us-east-1 and not any other region. From documentation and research, I have found that Lambda association support is only allowed from a couple of regions.

Lamba Function - this is located in the us-east-1 region only and its purpose is to read the URI and decrypt it. However, I have sent the encrypted URI to 11 people and for 7 people it has worked, whereas for the remaining it has shown 404 - page not found. The test users are located in Europe, Asia, and the UK. However, I must say; when I have been in a coffee shop the encrypted URI hasn't worked for me, but when I am outside the coffee shop, it has worked. The function location is only in the us-east-1 region.

KMS - In the application code, I am using the KMS client, where I am encrypting the URI (please see below links). The key_id that I am using is located in EU (London). I have tried the key_id from us-east-1, but I am having no luck with it, as it keeps showing a 404 page. When testing the URI on Lambda function, it throws out an error about the key_id being a master key, or not associated with the current region. However, when I did try creating the Lambda function in EU (London), the decrypt test feature location in AWS console did work for the Lamba function.

Some questions:
1. Is their any AWS firewall rules when connecting through coffee shops?
2. Is their any AWS firewall rules for security when connecting through Asia or not recognised locations?

Other:

I feel if CF allowed Lambda function association from EU (London) it may resolve the issue, as the key_id I am using is located in the EU (London)


Any help would be appreciated, as it has been driving me insane - much appreciated and thank you.

Amazon EC2	"[BUG?] RunInstances call started failing in eu-west-1 with a strange error
I have a boto3-based script that fetches the latest Ubuntu 16.04 AMI ID for the region and launches an instance. The instance is started with a BlockDeviceMappings specifying an encrypted root volume:
'BlockDeviceMappings': [{
    'DeviceName': '/dev/sda1',
    'Ebs': {
        'VolumeType': 'gp2',
        'Encrypted': True,
    },
}]

The script works in every region, but yesterday it started failing in eu-west-1.
An error occurred (InvalidBlockDeviceMapping) when calling the RunInstances operation: the encrypted flag cannot be specified since device /dev/sda1 has a snapshot specified.
The script used to work (and still works in other regions), and it did not change. I DO NOT specify a snapshot. I double-checked by enabling boto3 debug output and the request does not specify any snapshots.

What is wrong here?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: [BUG?] RunInstances call started failing in eu-west-1 with a strange error
After reading the documentation, it seems like it should not be possible to create an encrypted root EBS volume from an AMI with unencrypted EBS snapshot. But for some reason this actually works in every region other than eu-west-1.

I have checked the volume of an instance created in ap-southeast-2, it's marked as encrypted, and the AMI snapshot backing it is unencrypted?

Or is there a bug and the volumes are actually not encrypted even though the console says they are?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: [BUG?] RunInstances call started failing in eu-west-1 with a strange error
Good talk"
Amazon EC2	"Re: [BUG?] RunInstances call started failing in eu-west-1 with a strange error
According to the documentation that I found, it should not be possible to boot an instance with encrypted volume from an AMI with unencrypted snapshot.

But, using the following AMI in ap-southeast-2:
ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-xenial-16.04-amd64-server-20190406
ami-074a2888bf09cab0a
snap-0c44ca669187d9279

I've tried doing the following:

Trying to launch an instance in the web console does not let me select ""Encrypted"" (as expected).
Launching an instance with boto3 works just fine and the console indicates that my volume created from snap-0c44ca669187d9279 is encrypted with aws/ebs key.

Which, according to the documentation, should not be possible. It fails as expected in eu-west-1, but not in any other region I've tried (us-east-1, us-west-1, ap-southeast-2).

Is the console lying about the encryption status, or is there a new feature that auto-encrypts the volume created from unencrypted snapshot that's not available yet in eu-west-1? Even worse, it used to work the same way in eu-west-1, but now it doesn't."

I really feel like I should reiterate this point:

If it's the latter, it's a bug. If it's the former it's a bug that is also a potential compliance nightmare (""oops, sorry, we said we encrypted your volume but we actually didn't"")."

tldr; Unable to import .ova into VMWare Workstation. ova export not segmenting vmdk , wrong filesize(10323891968) in tar header, ovf seems correct.

Hello,
Im trying to use ""aws ec2 create-instance-export-task"" to export a ova/vmdk for vmware from a running ec2 instance to s3. Both are running in eu-central-1
The task switches to ""State"": ""completed"" after ~20h and results in a ova just under 80gb.

The size reported in the ovf seems plausible, my assumption is that something is breaking at the historical 11bit file-size limit of tar.

All of the help says to check firewall settings etc. This is an instance that I have been using for a long time that doesn't change. It is dyason.com and only has ssh/http/https open.

After this occurred I enabled metrics. I find them slightly interesting as it shows something might have occurred today before 08:00 causing it to enter the current state. There was a CPU spike to 20% and then it's hovering at 2.5%, it usually idles at 1%. (Can't attach a png it seems) Unfortunately I can't get onto the instance without restarting it, and I would quite like to ascertain the fault before doing that.

Any ideas on how I can find the root cause of this please?"

I rebooted and checked /var/log/messages. It looks like nothing happened between 07:47 until I restarted the instance.

Amazon EC2	"Cannot start EC2 instance after changing its type
Hello,

I have an instance i-0cd0f6d6361e14ec2, which was running okay. Decided to increase capacity.

Stopped the instance, changed instance type. Now it no longer starts. When I try to start it, it goes to ""pending"" state for a while, then back to ""stopped"" after about 24 seconds.

I tried changing instance type back and also to a couple of other, more capable types, no luck. Same behavior.

Also tried de-attaching and then re-attaching both volumes vol-0f66f100f638f4fd2 and vol-0f66f100f638f4fd2. Still not able to start.

Also tried creating an AMI out of stopped instance (which took about an hour but succeeded). Launching another instance from this AMI also fails, but instead of ""stopped"" the new instance ends ""terminated"" state after about 1 minute or so after launch.

I see the following on the description page of the stopped instance:

State transition reason: Server.InternalError
State transition reason message: Server.InternalError: Internal error on launch

Is this EC2 bug? As there are posts on this forum as of this March about similar errors. I don't think it is a storage size issue as my last full backup is about 50 GB while the volume is at 200 GB.

I opened a developer support plan to resolve this problem sooner, case ID 5971375681, but nothing is happening there for over 8 hours now, I wonder if someone from AWS could comment, as our customers are beginning to panic.

I need help as this is a small mail server, which is critical for our business. Any help?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: Cannot start EC2 instance after changing its type
Resolution: Save yourself money and trouble by checking and updating credit card with AWS.

My issue was resolved using the following steps:

1) First changed the support plan from Basic to Developer - this allowed me to create a technical support incident. This turned out to be not useful, as first response was received only after 13 hours. Apparently, this is outsourced to India, and their time zone is completely out  of sync with ours (Pacific Time).

2) As customers started to panic, upgraded support plan again to Business, and was able to create another incident and chat online with a support person, who traced down the problem to the key used to encrypt our data volume. ""Key Management Service"" page in AWS console was inaccessible because it believed that I did not complete the registration (incorrectly). One of the links on the info page went to credit card page, with all my cards there showing as expired. After I updated the credit card expiration date, I was able to start the instance.

I hope it helps someone."
Amazon EC2	"AMI work in original region but not when copied to other
Hi! 

I've an instance rolling in Ohio and wants to create a copy of that server and place in europe (eu-north). I made an AMI and copied it to the new region. I set up the instance with initially no additional configuration where security groups and other stuff were handled automatically. The instance starts and it's perfectly fine to access with ssh but not by public ipv4 or public dns by http or any other port. 

The error is simply a timeout after 60 seconds. No error logs in apache seems to register anything. I can run curl -i http://localhost/ with ssh and the server responds. I've disabled firewalls (sudo ufw disable) but no response.

For a test a created a new instance (in exactly the same way except for t3 instead of t2 and the key pair is different) of the AMI on the original region which runs perfectly without problems. 

What can I try next?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: AMI work in original region but not when copied to other
Hello,

I have looked at the instance you have copied to a new region and I can see you are only allowing Port 22 on the security groups.

For other services like HTTP or HTTPS you will need to allow them on the security groups of your instance.

HTTP - Port 80
HTTPS - Port 443

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html

If you do not allow these ports to be open and try to connect you will time out."
Amazon EC2	"EC2 instance regularly crashing; ""stop"" not working
I recently deployed a t3.micro instance, running Debian 9, functioning mainly as a lightweight webserver. 

In the last week or so, the instance has gone down on several occasions. There's nothing in any logs on the server itself. I have been unable to stop the instance using the regular ""stop"" command; I have to issue this and then do a ""force stop"". I can then restart the instance without difficulty, but after a few days it goes down again.

The ""System"" and ""Instance"" status checks claim that everything is OK, but during this time the webserver stops responding, my SSH login freezes, a Twitter bot stops functioning, etc., so if everything is OK, I'm not sure why every service on the server fails at once.

The need for a ""force stop"" suggests the problem might be with EC2 itself, but I'm at a loss for how to analyze this. This server is replacing a previous t2.small instance, set up identically, that ran for a year at a time without incident.

What should I do to try to figure out what's going on?"
Amazon EC2	"Instances stuck in shutting down
These two instances are stuck in shutting down, can you please terminate them?

i-022148dc4a9e9ed72
i-0ab972fd462667a17

I am unclear what the proper process is to get this fixed. I don't have access to post in these forums with that account, and I can't open a support ticket.  These machines can't be terminated because of a problem on AWS side, and we have been paying for them for about a month.

What is the correct and fast process for dealing with this?"
Amazon EC2	"Re: Instances stuck in shutting down

Amazon EC2	"Re: Instances stuck in shutting down
I can see that one of the instances is currently in a stuck stopping state.

Amazon EC2	"What does ""frequency of interruption"" mean in Spot Instance Advisor?
AWS's Spot Instance Advisor estimates the ""frequency of interruption"" for each instance type in each region.

https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/instance-advisor/

For example, In us-west-2, the t2.large currently has a frequency of interruption of 5%, and the t3.large of 5-10%.

But what does ""5%"" actually mean?

I found one other reference to interruption percentages in AWS podcast ""#305: Saving Money with EC2 Spot"", published 2019-04-01.

""In the last three months, 93% of the reason why spot instances got terminated is because the user was finished with them and just turned them off. However, they can also be terminated if the prevailing market price for the spot instance exceeds your bid price.""

https://aws.amazon.com/podcasts/aws-podcast/#305

So is Spot Advisor telling me that 5% of t2.large instances are interrupted because of spot market movements?

Or is it that every hour that the t2.large instance runs, it has a 5% chance of being interrupted?

Any clarification on how to interpret these numbers would be greatly appreciated!"
