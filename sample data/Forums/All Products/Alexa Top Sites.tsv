Alexa Top Sites	"UrllInfo Performance
Sometimes we have slowness while calling the UrlInfo endpoint, like 5-10s.  This seems to be times when we are making a lot of calls, like if we make 200 calls within 10 min it will be an average of 5 sec during those times.  Is this because it is throttled?  Would it be faster if we made the calls from within an AWS lambda?  So, we would be calling our own service that resides in AWS and it would be making the UrlInfo calls inside of our AWS service.  That way it would be AWS to AWS calls for UrlInfo.  I know this would be an extra hop.  It's just a thought."
Alexa Top Sites	"AWS ec2 startup script
I understand that there are 2 ways to execute a script in ec2 :
1. Userdata
2. Cloud - init config.

But for both of these cases.We need to login to the instance from putty to start the script. I was wondering if there is any other way to run script in background for ec2 instance without opening a connection to it from putty or any other sources. Essentially all the script execution is completed on single click while starting instance. 

If not, then how does the userdata get executed when auto scaling is enabled. Do we have to connect to all the 10 instance in order to execute userdata predefined during creation of instance?

Thanks in advance"
Alexa Top Sites	"Re: AWS ec2 startup script
you can specify the userdata in the launch configuration so that Autoscale automatically add it when it launches the instance

by changing ats.amazonaws.com to ats.us-west-1.amazonaws.com in request URL I was finally able to get a response. Thank you so much!

However, two problems came up:

1) There's a discrepancy in Global rank between response and actual Alexa.com data. 

For example, the following request:
https://ats.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/api?Action=TopSites&ResponseGroup=Country&Start=333&Count=1

tells us that site ranked #333 (for example) Globally is outbrain.com:
<aws:DataUrl>outbrain.com</aws:DataUrl>

however, here: https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/outbrain.com it's #331
Is it expected? And is it possible to get same result in my response as it's shown on alexa.com?

BTW, free API returns correct Global Rank when requesting that URL:
<POPULARITY URL=""outbrain.com/"" TEXT=""331"" SOURCE=""panel""/>

2) I can see there's a limit of sites that can be retrieved via such request:
<aws:TotalSites>389415</aws:TotalSites>

So when I try to request a site ranked #389416, it doesn't work.
Is there a way to go beyond this limit and find a site ranked #5555555, for example? I can see in this thread that it's possible to go up to 10 million: 

https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=167457&tstart=0

but how to do it?

Thank you!"
Alexa Top Sites	"Re: Signature issues when working with Alexa Top Sites
Hi,

Just to be clear, you should still be hitting ats.amazonaws.com and adding a ""Host"" header with the value ats.us-west-1.amazonaws.com

Regarding your questions:
1) Site info ranks are calculated with 3 months data and API ranks are 1 month. That explains that difference.

2) The limit is dynamic and is calculated based on the statistical significance of the data being processed. Beyond that limit there is no enough data to calculate the rank reliably.

There is a 1M top sites you can download from:
http://s3.amazonaws.com/alexa-static/top-1m.csv.zip

Estimated ranks only include web browser data, not mobile. However, sites with Certified metrics can get their mobile data directly measured and use that for their site's rankings. This article explains the difference between Alexa estimated metrics and certified metrics:

Thanks for reaching out. The difference is expected - the rank on alexa.com is a 3 month rank whereas the rank in the top 1 million download is a 1 month rank.

The Top Sites by Country are lists of the most popular sites among users in a particular country. Note that the top sites list for a particular country may include sites based elsewhere in the world if those sites are popular in that country. If you are seeing Russian sites in the top sites lists for Netherlands that means that people in the Netherlands are visiting that site, rather than that the site is located in the Netherlands.

Alexa Top Sites	"Re: Top sites for country and category at same time
Hi -Kobas-,

I'm sorry for the delay in getting back to you. We do not currently have a way to query by category and country via the API. Instead what you can do is query the Alexa Top Sites API for a specific country and then take the resulting list and query the Alexa Web Information Service API for category data on each site in the list. For example:

1. Grab a list of the top 100 UK sites via ATS.
2. Request category for each of the 100 sites via AWIS using the UrlInfo Action and the Categories ResponseGroup.

Alternatively you could only use AWIS and grab top sites by category lists. This would allow you to get the top 10 sport sites and then get country data for those sites, but you would not be able to only pull a list of UK Sport top sites. For example:

1. Grab a list of the top 100 Sports sites via AWIS using the CategoryListings Action and the Listings ResponseGroup.
2. Request country data for each of the 100 sites via AWIS using the UrlInfo Action and the RankByCountry ResponseGroup.

$countryCode = count($argv) > 3 ? $argv[3] : """";

to:

exit(-1);
}
else {
$accessKeyId = ""YOURACCESSKEY"";
$secretAccessKey = ""YOURSECRETKEY"";
$countryCode = count($argv) > 1 ? $argv[1] : ""Global"";
}


Let us know if you still have trouble after changing those lines.

Alexa Top Sites	"Get Top Sites by Category
Hello everyone. I am building a service that gets Alexa Top Sites. But currently I can get only websites filtered by country and/or city (according to TopSites Api Documentation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AlexaTopSites/latest/) 

My question is: Is there a way in which I retrieve sites based on a category I previously selected? Something similar like the countries now, in one call to get all categories and their codes and in other call to provide query information for the selected category and retrieve sites based to that category?

Thank you,
pesovski."
Alexa Top Sites	"Re: Get Top Sites by Category
Hi pesovski,

Yes, that is possible with another Alexa API - Alexa Web Information Services. To use that API you will first need to sign up for the service by clicking on the ""Sign up for AWIS"" button on this page:
http://aws.amazon.com/awis/

Then you should read the technical documentation here:
http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AlexaWebInfoService/latest/
(http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AlexaWebInfoService/latest/index.html?ApiReference_CategoryBrowseAction.html & http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AlexaWebInfoService/latest/ApiReference_CategoryListingsAction.html cover Top Sites by Category requests)

Also you can find sample programs for AWIS here:
http://aws.amazon.com/code/AWIS

Alexa Top Sites	"Re: Get Top Sites by Category
Thank you very much, this solved one of my problems. However, I noticed one more problem. I can't get 'Recursive' option to work. For every category I get only subcategories (with CategoryBrowse action call) and Top sites for that category (with CategoryListings action call). But although I get the number of sites under that category, I can't get them returned.

For example I get this info in the xml file: 
<aws:RecursiveCount>6994</aws:RecursiveCount>
<aws:Count>6</aws:Count>

and only the 6 sites returned, nothing more.

Here you can see a test result of my application.
http://pesovski.mk/alexa

Do you have an idea why is that?

I tried setting the 'Recursive' parameter to true | 1 | yes ... but nothing came in with result.

Still I am unable to point my domain to EC2 instance. Any suggestions."
Alexa Top Sites	"Re: Pointing godaddy domain name to EC2 instance
You have successfully switched the domain to the Route 53 name servers, so DNS is now handled entirely by Route 53. Well, if you switched very recently please give it 24 - 48 hours for everything to fully propagate. If you had MX records for email (or something else that is important) in your DNS configuration over at GoDaddy, you will want to add those records to the Route 53 hosted zone. 

There is an A record present in your Route 53 hosted zone, pointing merahunar.co.in to the IP address you mentioned. You may also want to add a record to cover www. You can make it an A record as well, but this time you put ""www"" in the ""Name"" field instead of leaving it empty. Regarding the server, it is unfortunately handing back an empty response for some reason. Your browser may say something about ""no data received"". It indicates that the DNS part of the setup is functioning. So the next step is to look into what's happening on the server. Perhaps you have some web server logs that you can review for example."
