Amazon DocumentDB	"Compression
I'm considering a move from a self-managed set of MongoDB clusters.  When calculating DB storage and backup storage, do I assume compressed or uncompressed?  If compressed, is there a guideline I should use for estimation?"
Amazon DocumentDB	"Re: Compression
Currently, use uncompressed. For more information on pricing, please see: https://aws.amazon.com/documentdb/pricing/"
Amazon DocumentDB	"Index Creation fails after 2h with ""operation was interrupted"" code 11601
I'm trying to create a few indices on a large collection, that I was able to create on MongoDB without problems on the same instance type. Each index took 6-7h to generate. Amazon DocumentDB seems to kill the index creation exactly after 2h with the following response: { ""ok"" : 0, ""errmsg"" : ""operation was interrupted"", ""code"" : 11601 }


Does Amazon DocumentDB impose a 2h limit for index creations?

Amazon DocumentDB	"Query with $in doesn't use index
Hi,
Is there a reason why queries with $in use COLLSCAN and not IXSCAN if the array passed to $in is larger than 1?
Here is an example (assuming there is a collection test_coll and array list_of_ids with few ids):
db.test_coll.find({_id: {$in: list_of_ids.slice(0,1)}}).explain()

The call above (with just 1 item in $in) has winningPlan:
{
      ""stage"": ""IXSCAN"",
      ""indexName"": ""_id_"",
      ""direction"": ""forward""
}


But if there are even 2 items in $in, like this:
db.test_coll.find({_id: {$in: list_of_ids.slice(0,2)}}).explain()

The winningPlan is this:
{
      ""stage"": ""COLLSCAN""
}"

Amazon DocumentDB	"DocumentDB + AppSync ...coming?
Hi, 

is it possible // are there plans to hook DocumentDB into AppSync?  Is there some base reason not to that I'm missing?

Our use case:
we currently use a MongoDB server on EC2 for our mobile app.  We're contemplating adding AppSync for various feature benefits.  However we're not seeing options (did we miss them?) to support that use of our existing EC2-hosted DB out of the box, so thinking we'll need to move the MongoDB from EC2 to something else. At the moment that something else is DynamoDB, but DocumentDB looks like it might be a better home for a MongoDB?  I'm not against changing the DB type, but if we don't have to, why make more work.  

Thoughts y'all?"
Amazon DocumentDB	"Re: DocumentDB + AppSync ...coming?
+100 for this."

Amazon DocumentDB	"Shutting down DocumentDB instances
Hi, I am just beginning to develop an application using DocumentDB, but during development my usage is going to be pretty sporadic. Is there any way to shutdown a DocumentDB instance when it is not in use and restart it for development? Or is the best way to achieve this to use a Cloudformation stack to create and delete the cluster/instances using a snapshot?"
Amazon DocumentDB	"Re: Shutting down DocumentDB instances
There are a couple of options here:

One option is to take a snapshot of the cluster when you are finished, delete the cluster, and then restore for the snapshot when you want to continue to develop.

A second option is to develop with a single instance (note, because of the separation of storage and compute in Amazon DocumentDB's architecture, even a single instance has highly durable storage).

Amazon DocumentDB	"Cloudwatch log support
On the cli page for documentDB it has the `--cloudwatch-logs-export-configuration` option listed,
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/docdb/modify-db-cluster.html

Are logs actually supported from documentDB yet?
I can find no reference in the docs to what values this option would take.

In the docs for auroraMysql it lists the variable log types that DB type can provide, is this available anywhere for DocumentDB?

Amazon DocumentDB	"Additional instance types for low tier or development use
Currently the lowest costing cluster you can stand up is a r4 system, which is rather costly per month (~245.00 x 3 members for a complete cluster).  I know I can shut down the other two members of the cluster while in development, but I wish there was a smaller tier I could stand up to keep the clustered environment.  For some standing up and tearing down the cluster may be an option, however that is something I would personally not want to have to do.  
Does Amazon plan on offering any one click cluster setups with something a bit more on the economical side for development phases / work?  
To be competitive with Mongo Atlas, AWS needs to offer additional tiers of service, possibly offer cost saving via reserve instances, and allow the end user the ability to one-click add additional instances to a cluster.  As someone trying to get a product off the ground, this is cost prohibitive and forces me out of the AWS suite of products where I would rather keep everything together under one umbrella.
Thanks in advance!"

Amazon DocumentDB	"Timeline for role support?
I was evaluating DocumentDB as replacement for our Compose-setup, but just found out that you can't assign anything but full access to all databases for user accounts which becomes a dealbreaker because it becomes ridiculous for several reasons to run one instance per micro-service.

""All users are created with the dbAdminAnyDatabase, readWriteAnyDatabase, and clusterAdmin roles, meaning that they have full access to all databases and collections within a cluster.""

Is this even on the roadmap, or should I just forget about DocumentDB for now? Given the current landscape in software architecture, it seems kind of flawed to release it without the roles support, TBH

Amazon DocumentDB	"Cannot connect to database
I've tried connecting using the suggested command:
mongo --ssl --host <host> --sslCAFile rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem --username <user> --password <insertYourPassword>

however I always receive the reply:
W NETWORK  [thread1] Failed to connect to <ip>:<port> after 5000ms milliseconds, giving up.

I've tried using default and advanced configuration settings - for testing purposes, I've mad the security group expose all ports at 0.0.0.0\0 to remove that as an issue. There is an existing ec2 instance in this vpc that runs mongo which I can connect to so the vpc configuration should allow the connection. I'm not sure what else could be at issue here - any suggestions? any resources I can read to determine the issue?"

Amazon DocumentDB	"Using Secret Manager for password bug?
I'm trying to use secrets manager to generate the password for DocumentDB and I'm stuck. I've managed to simplify to the below. It doesn't seem to matter if I generate it or not actually, when hard coded to a short password I still get the error. 

      MasterUserPassword:         '{{resolve:secretsmanager:ab:SecretString}}'


Property validation failure: [Length of value {{{resolve:secretsmanager:ab:SecretString}}} for property {/MasterUserPassword} is greater than maximum allowed length {41}]


However the below works: 
      MasterUserPassword:         '{{resolve:secretsmanager:a:SecretString}}'


Anyone else tried this or hit this issue or managed to get it working?
Looks like it's doing the 41 digit check on the pre-resolved string, not the actual password"
Amazon DocumentDB	"Weird read performance
Hello,

I'm doing benchmark test of DocumentDB. Inserting documents with random payload and reading it back immediately by different consumer. Both writer and reader use multiple concurrent connection. DocumentDB is db4.r4.large in us-east-1; clients are nodejs using official mongodb npm client. Client run on EC2 in the same region and VPC.

The problem is that read timing has unexpected dependency on document size. up to about 4KB read takes < 4ms; Documents around 100KB are consumed within 7-8 ms;  however for documents of around 8-16KB consumption takes 40ms on average (max is 70-80 ms, and I think this is the problem).

This is 100% reproducible.

Edit: to me it looks like not tcp_nodelay from server side?

Edit2: I don't have histogram, but max of read time seems to confirm nodelay theory. Max for 1-4KB is 20-30 ms; max for 8KB is 70-80 ms; max for 100KB is 6-8 ms!!! I.e. for 100 KB payload variance is very low, while for small payloads it is huge.
