AWS Hackathons	"SimpleQueue and ReadCount
Hello!I am currently using Amazon Simple Queue in a test application.One operation reads items from the queue.I want to read all items of the queue. (There are 10 items in the queue)I set the ReadCount to 25 and the ReadLockTimeoutSeconds to 0My Query for Reading the Queue looks like htis:http://webservices.amazon.com/onca/xml?Service=AWSSimpleQueueService    &AWSAccessKeyId=xyz1234    &Operation=Read    &QueueName=myQueueName    &ReadCount=25    &ReadLockTimeoutSeconds=0Now i would expect i can read all 10 items (as i set ReadCount to 25) in one request, but the request only returns 2-4 items once.Does anybody have an idea what could be wrong?Greetz          fitzecarraldo"
AWS Hackathons	"Mass Ban?
Looks like I have been banned a long with most other users.  Is this true?  I know that I have not been using any bots or anything that violates the TOS to my knowledge and would like to shed some light on this issue.  I also had about $170 on my dashboard waiting to be sent to the 'my account' page that I can no longer access.  I hope that this can be resolved and I can get back to my account and continue turking soon.  Thanks."
AWS Hackathons	"Mass Ban?
I have similar concerns. My approval rate was roughly 87% and suddenly the site started putting me into the infinite forward loop mode. I've been trying as hard as I can to get the right artist, fix up the accented characters if they were missing, etc.I have spoken to other people, and lots of them seen to suffer these symptoms?"

I saw every artist name put into the box and submitted it and got another and just kept going!  Its upsetting because i was owed another 55 dollars, and i spent a lot of my own time  working on this so i could buy people christmas presents ON AMAZON!"

I have been having similar problems with logging in to mturk.amazon.com that indicate I was banned.  I too, however, have never used an automated script or bot to complete any of my HITs.  I am aware this is not the proper place to raise such an issue, but there is seemingly no way to raise a customer service issue such as this through mturk.amazon.com (except through an automated email form that redirects you to itself).Can you either give me an email address to send my concerns to, or address them here?

AWS Hackathons	"Turk Requester Toolkit
Problems building Mechanical Turk Requester Toolkit. Got following error  in connection with [generate-axis] target of build.xml script:
'The <urn:maven-artifact-ant:dependencies> type doesn't support the nested ""dependency"" element. '
My Windows 2000 system has JDK 5.0, Ant 1.6.1, JWSDP 1.6, and Axis 1.2.1 installed, with their environment variables set as per docs.
I want JAXB binding, so I first ran ant as follows:
G:\mech_turk_src> ant -Djwsdp.dir=F:\Sun\jwsdp-1.6 prepare-jaxb
Build failed with error: 'The <urn:maven-artifact-ant:dependencies> type doesn't support the nested ""pom"" element.'
As a workaround, I copied JAXB-related .jar files (8) to the \binding\jaxb\pom folder, which helped get me past the [prepare-jaxb] target. I've studied the build.xml and rtk-with-jaxb.pom files, and they both show nested <dependency> elements. Is this caused by Ant or  the Maven (maven-artifact-ant-2.0-dep.jar  not handling the <urn:maven-artifact-ant:dependencies> namespace for the nested <dependency> elements?"

AWS Hackathons	"Turk Requester Toolkit
Thanks, John, for replying to my inquiry. I'm still unable to build the Mechanical Turk Requester Toolkit, but I have made significant progress. Apparently, in the build.xml file, the absence of the namespace prefix ""artifact:"" for 'pom' and 'dependency' nested child elements was causing the following build failures:

After editing build.xml, the dependency resources were downloaded from the Maven repository. However, when I issued the following command:

I was able to build the Mechanical Turk Toolkit after changing the ANT_HOME environment variable (in Windows) to point to the JWSDP-1.6\apache-ant directory. ANT_HOME had pointed to Apache Ant 1.6.1, which does not include the FileList$FileName.class in ant.jar

Ahh, very good! I must ask, however, if there is a particular style of script you reffer to. There are those which merely improve the user interface to allow for quicker responses from workers.

Tony,
Thanks for helping me qualify my earlier response.  I'm specifically referring to bots that provide automatic replies.  They're dishonest,  increase the cost to the Requesters and ultimately take valuable HITs away from honest Workers.

I tried this using Visual C++ 2005, from Visual Studio 2005 Beta 2.

AWS Hackathons	"Visual C++ support
I think I know why this may be working for you and not me.  I apologize if I was being too vague.  I am interested in creating a Native/Unmanaged/not .NET C++ application.
If I create a Managed (""CLR"") C++ application, this works fine.
Exact steps to reproduce:
- File->New Project
- Visual C++->Win32->Win 32 Console Application->OK
- In the Win32 Application Wizard hit Finish
- Select the project in Solution Explorer
- Project->Add Web Reference
- Enter the location of the WSDL (http://webservices.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/AWSSimpleQueueService.wsdl)
- Go->Add Reference
 
More info:
When I tried this in Visual C++ 2005 Express Beta 2 the ""Add Web Reference"" menu item is disabled when I'm working with a Win32 application.  Therefore, you may need to try this either in the non-express version of Visual C++ 2005, or in Visual C++ .NET 2003.
Alternatively, I've attached a project I created in the non-express version of VC++ 2005.  You can open this project in VC++ 2005 Express and see the problem.
Still more info:
Under the covers, VC++ is using the sproxy.exe tool to generate the proxy code and this is what is failing.  So if you don't want to mess with all this project stuff, you can reproduce this fairly easily with any version of VC++ (VC++ .NET 2003, VC++ 2005 Express, VC++ 2005 not-express...).
Open a Visual Studio command prompt and enter the following command:
""sproxy /wsdl http://webservices.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/AWSSimpleQueueService.wsdl"""
AWS Hackathons	"Visual C++ support
Ah, got it. I can reproduce same error now... Not sure if sproxy simply does not have support for doc/literal, or there are other issues.  Let me research this a bit more. I'll post when I have more info.

I don't believe you can sort by offer prices on particular ASIN. You may need to download the offers first and do the sorting on your side. Try this:

Alexa doesn't sweep and clean perfectly :
 
I moved many of my Apparel Sites from ASIN links to AWS links.
And I notice that Alexa is not sweeping and cleaning the websites in total perfection. ( The AWS links )
There are many apparel products that are unavailable, or ""out of stock"" and Alexa does not say anything.
As a result I am worried about this tool. Because many products that are unavailable continue inside my many apparel pages.

AWS Hackathons	"Alexa doesn't sweep and clean perfectly
I wish that I am wrong but my data continues giving indication that Alexa fails finding all those garments that are ""Out of Stock"" or Unavailable.
My opinion is that Alexa ( for uncovering these unavailable items ) has been a Wonderful Tool, a Very Useful Tool for me. And I deeply thank its existence.
Alexa has been a Wonder and a Beauty. But I am lately very worried about its accuracy.
Since I moved into AWS links things seem to have changed and Alexa does not uncover all ""bad offers"", those offers without inventory.
Vicente"
AWS Hackathons	"Alexa doesn't sweep and clean perfectly
Sorry if I am repetitive.
But Alexa is not picking the ""Out of Stock"" or ""Backordered"" items.
It is skipping over many problems and unavailable items.
Reports have almost no problems, but the websites are full of availability problems.

Ugly Tags inside Apparel Descriptions for XSLT
Something went wrong in the last day ( or last two days ) with the Product Descriptions of Many Apparel Items in the XSLT system.
For example the item B0000865Q9 gives this Ugly Text :

<FONT size=""1"">2) The same question for Newport News : Why they don't care about the Middle Image in XSLT for many new products ???</FONT>
<FONT size=""1"">3) Why is it that other Apparel merchants like Cherokee, Merona, Xhilaration do not care about producing the middle image in XSLT.</FONT>
<FONT size=""1"">4) I hope that there are no more catastrophes of Merchants leaving Amazon like : Spiegel, Wintersilks and Venus Swimwear.</FONT>
<FONT size=""1"">5) I pray every dawn before sunrise that no more ""Excluded Merchants"" are added to the list. For my system of sales and my domain names the ""Excluded Merchants"" are a stab on my back.</FONT>
<FONT size=""1"">I hope that these critiques are taken for the benefit of the bottom line of Amazon and for the dynamism of AMZN corporation and not as an angry rant of a frustrated associate.</FONT>

AWS Hackathons	"Can I insert XSLT inside phpBB Forum ???
Dear Friends :
I am in the last version of phpBB and working on a Forum.
I don't like the idea of placing a link to another of my domain names inside one of my phpBB posts so that the people in  a thread buy from me.
Creating an HTML page inside the Forum Domain Name in order to sell that thing that we are talking about ( and placing a link ) is also very cumbersome and leading to disorganization.
I don't want to place the ""ASIN Link"" 
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/theProductASINcode/ref=nosim/myAmazonID
because I want the image and the availability being sent from Amazon automatically as Datafeed showing the last price, image, etc ...
So that people can immediately talk about the product offered and praise or criticize it. Or even offer an alternative or better deal. !! 
Is that possible in today's phpBB technology ???
Does it require complex Mods or Hacks by experts ???
Any URL that teaches the trick ??
Do we have to wait for another phpBB Version ???
Any other Forum technology that does the trick ???
Thanks for help

Hi Ozorg,
I think you are experiencing a timeout bug. It is caused by poor coordination between AWS and Alexa... basically AWS times out before the Alexa search can respond. We should have it fixed in the next month or so.

I know that I can not blame Amazon for the Foolishness and indiscipline of some of the Merchants or Brands that sell using the Wonderful System of ECS.
But if Amazon can do anything, then please do it. I can not see how the present situation of disorder can benefit the customer, the buyer, Amazon or the Associate.
People would flock to other websites where they can buy the merchandise. Useless to have a beautiful ECS technology if the buyer can not act because of ""Out of Stock"".
Wal Mart has fought a hard battle against the cancer of ""Out of Stock"", that is offering products that are not available.

Carabella during the past three days.
Many Medium Images are missing for XSLT :
Newport News, Venus Swimwear, Merona, Cherokee, etc ...
Carabella was a great infractor before the Total Collapse.
 
JCPenney inside Amazon is a total Mess :
It is almost useless to work with JCPenney offerings inside Amazon. They are fleeting creatures that live for less than one or two weeks, if you are lucky.
I know that many people will tell me that the coming Spring is the Guilty Man, and that this should always happen with the arrival of Spring. As if the slow and gradual change of Seasons was the excuse for a breakdown of law and order inside product offerings. Things need to be more planned, ordered, methodical, progressive and continuous.
I hope that something can be done. Great Technology, but lack of discipline by merchants. They just don't fill the information. Or stay out of Amazon while selling somewhere else.

Hi,Thanks for participating in the beta. First of all, we need to change the ""XML Aggregation failed"" message text. It is essentially a timeout failure. This means that at least one of the search servers did not respond within the timeout. The more pressing issue that you bring to light is that the timeout parameter you supplied is not properly controlling some internal timeouts.

AWS Hackathons	"Whimsical Images. Loss of Spiegel Collec
Whimsical Images.
Loss of Spiegel Collection
 
Hi. Look at these troubles please :
 
1)  Apparel XSLT : Many Images stop working in XSLT from one day to next. Even if the products are available within 24 hours.
For example these medium images were perfectly working and now they have stopped suddenly : 
B000121AS
B000121X8A
B0000UTLTQ
B0002LWTRY
2) The Spiegel Collection has been totally absolutely unavailable for more than one month. But XSLT continues sending information and images. It would be a good idea to give some information to Associates on what is going on. Are negotiations proceding in order to repair the Spiegel-Amazon marriage ???
3) Newport News, Carabella, Venus Swimwear, Merona, Bra Smyth, Silhouettes, and many other brands lack the middle images for a great part of their apparel products.
I know that Amazon is not guilty of recklessnes and that the brands have some responsibility in filling the Information. They should complete the data with care and love and not leave things half finished.
In Newport News there are strange tags inside the Datafeed Information for some products.  I have already pointed out that problem in past posts in this forum.
Filling the Information that is lacking would be for the benefit of everybody and of Amazon in Special. 
It would be a good idea to send the Availability Variable for ""Back Ordered Products"" with a future date when you can buy the product. Newport News and Eddie Bauer are just doing that. But we need to generalize this good idea for the other brands. So that the Associate has less work to do with the whimsicalities of ""Out of Stock""....
Thanks for any attention.

AWS Hackathons	"Collect Apparel Garbage - Wal Mart Examp
Collect Apparel Garbage - Wal Mart Example
Praise Wal Mart \!!!
I read that Wal Mart has been in a strong campaign to avoid offers to the public which are not ready available ... This is for Bricks and Mortar and also for Online Systems.
The philosophy of Wal Mart : Seriousness and Constancy in Offers. Respect for the customer or visitor.
Offering beautiful things that can't be bought tomorrow is a waste of time, for everybody but specially for the KING ( the customer ).
Offers should be constant for a rational amount of time and intermitent ""Out of Stock"" has to be avoided.
Inside Amazon :
Spiegel has been totally unavailable inside Amazon for many weeks. A Huge powerful collection has apparently quarrelled with Amazon. Is there any spat ??? ..... Is there any divorce of this happy marriage ???
But the images continue being sent by XSLT ( with unavailable of course )... this is super frustrating.
Other brands that are Increasingly Irresponsible and that tease the customer like in a strip tease are these :
Bealls Florida and JCPenney
Their items are available for less time than cakes in a kindergarden.
So it is a waste of time for Associates and visitors to fall in love with the pretty items. But it is love at first sight. Because if they wait then the item will be unavailable tomorrow.
I am a total ignorant of marketing, retailing and eTailing. But my intuition tells me that this is not right.
I get the idea that the visitor is the Guinea Pig for Marketing Studies and that Amazon Apparel becomes the kingdom of Fleeting Availabilities that become Ghost Unavailabilities.
Vanishing Ghosts of a Bewitched House.
Another complaint : big important collections lack the middle image for XSLT and for many products ... The greatest pain is Newport News, as I have posted here several times. Carabella also fails for many beautiful products.

Your entry body must be encoded this way because the SQS wsdl ( http://webservices.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/AWSSimpleQueueService.wsdl ) defines QueueEntryBody as:<xs:element name=""QueueEntryBody"" type=""xs:string""/>Since QueueEntryBody is a scalar string, you can't put further unescaped XML in its place.The XMLEscaping element controls the encoding of AWS *responses* and isn't helpful in this situation.

AWS Hackathons	"Deleteing a queue fails
If I empty a queue immediately  after dequeing all the messages in it I get a failure saying that the queue is not empty. If I sleep for a bit and delete the queue then it works.

I'm guessing that I need to wait for at least ReadLockTimeoutSeconds after dequing the last message before I can delete it. Is that so or is there another magic number?

I can't find any reference to this in the documentation. Would it be possible to add something to cover this issue to the documentation?

If I do need to wait ReadLockTimeoutSeconds I would really like an API to retrieve this for a single queue. I know that ListMyQueues will give me this for all queues but I may have thousands of queues so that call would be expensive to make.

       John Wilson"
AWS Hackathons	"Deleteing a queue fails
The ""magic number"" you need to wait between dequeuing the last entry and deleting the queue is 60 seconds. It's unrelated to the read-lock timeout, but rather it represents the time it takes for the change to propagate through our system.

You are right -- this quirk should definitely be documented."
AWS Hackathons	"Deleteing a queue fails
Thanks John, the code seems to be performing reliably with a 60 second sleep 

        John Wilson"
AWS Hackathons	"Control characters in messages
The REST interface to the Amazon Simple Queue Service lets you include arbitrary control characters in the message when using the enqueue operation. This causes a couple of problems

1/ if you include the NULL character (value 0) then the message is truncated at that point (there's C code behind this interface isn't there?)

2/ Other control characters are accepted OK. However when the message is read the response is not well formed XML

Point 2 is the killer. An XML document may not contain control characters other than CR, NL and HT. You can't include control characters by using &x01 or by any other trick. That just can't be in the document at all.

The result of this is that the system allows you to post messages which cannot be retrieved by software which uses XML compliant components (i.e. a normal XML parser). This is a really big problem which you have to fix ASAP.

The REST layer needs to check for control characters and reject messages containing them.

Note this is (or should be) a REST only problem. The SOAP interface is XML so your SOAP implementation will (or should) reject a SOAP document which contains illegal control characters as the XML will be non well formed.

John Wilson"
AWS Hackathons	"Control characters in messages
There is another, related, problem....

As far as I can see the REST layer is assuming that the URL is UTF-8 encoded Unicode (this is fine and corresponds to the W3C and IETF views on encoding URIs as I understand them)

Unfortunately it does not check that the UTF-8 encoding is correct. If you supply a message which has bad UTF-8 encoding it is placed in the queue and this causes the XML produced as a result of the read operation to be corrupt (i.e. it contains the bad UTF-8 encoding)

Dave, thanks for the clarification.

The Enqueue documentation says that the QueueEntryBody must be an ""An alphanumeric string"". This seems unnecessarily restrictive (I can Base64 encode the message, of course, but I'd rather not). Can you clarify this? My tests indicate that you will accept more than alphanumeric but I'd like to know what the actual restrictions are. For example I would expect you to have the same restrictions on control characters that XML imposes (only CR, NL  and HT allowed)"

Hi John,

What request did you receive this response to?  A misspelled service name in the url can cause this response.  In such a case, it's not always clear which namespace applies.

Thanks,
Duane at Amazon"
AWS Hackathons	"ListMyQueues when there are no queues
Hi Duane,

Yes the error was a response to a mangled URL. However I would still expect the response to be in some namespace or other. You seem to be using namespaces as a versioning device for the API. I would expect you to want to version these error responses in exactly the same way as the non error responses.

If I get one of these errors I want to know if it's in a format I'm familiar with (i.e. I know about the namespace URI) or if it's a newer format in which case I need to log the fact that my software needs updating. At the moment, because there is no namespace, I can't tell if I should be able to understand the response or not. In addition these responses are undocumented as your schema only covers the namespace http://webservices.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/2004-10-14."
AWS Hackathons	"AWIS SOAP Fix for missing parameters
Current WDSL contains bugs, and we cannot generate valid SOAP request.
Therefore, we only receive missing required argument error.

But, updated WDSL is not available yet.
We can wait official release of updated WSDL.
But, I couldn't wait and modified WSDL manufally.

I checked in Apache Axis and .NET(C#) and both worked correctly.

I'm not good at English and cannot describe properly.
So I'll show the full code related to this issue.

I'll take UrlInfo operation as a example, but this issue applies to all the operations.

[UrlInfo operation]

A SOAP request generated from current WSDL is looks like this:

<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?>
<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"" xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"" xmlns:xsd=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"">
<soap:Body>
<UrlInfo xmlns=""http://webservices.amazon.com/AWSAlexa/2004-09-15"">
<SubscriptionId>${SubscriptionId}</SubscriptionId>
<UrlInfoRequest>
<ResponseGroup>TrafficData</ResponseGroup>
<Url>www.w3c.org</Url>
</UrlInfoRequest>
</UrlInfo>
</soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>

But response from this request is rejected like this:

<Error>
<Code>AWS.MissingParameters</Code>
<Message>Your request is missing required parameters. Required parameters include Url.</Message>
</Error>

A valid request for AWIS is:

<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?>
<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"" xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"" xmlns:xsd=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"">
<soap:Body>
<UrlInfo xmlns=""http://webservices.amazon.com/AWSAlexa/2004-09-15"">
<SubscriptionId>${SubscriptionId}</SubscriptionId>
<Request>
<ResponseGroup>TrafficData</ResponseGroup>
<Url>www.w3c.org</Url>
</Request>
</UrlInfo>
</soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>

To generate this SOAP request, current WSDL should be fixed like this:

Possible FIX (1):

<xs:element name=""UrlInfo"">
<xs:complexType>
<xs:sequence>
<xs:element name=""SubscriptionId"" type=""xs:string"" minOccurs=""0""/>
<xs:element name=""Request"" type=""tns:UrlInfoRequest"" minOccurs=""0"" maxOccurs=""unbounded""/>
</xs:sequence>
</xs:complexType>
</xs:element>

<xs:complexType name=""UrlInfoRequest"">
<xs:sequence>
<xs:element name=""ResponseGroup"" type=""xs:string"" minOccurs=""0""/>
<xs:element name=""Url"" type=""xs:string""/>
</xs:sequence>
</xs:complexType>

Possible FIX (2):

<xs:element name=""UrlInfo"">
<xs:complexType>
<xs:sequence>
<xs:element name=""SubscriptionId"" type=""xs:string"" minOccurs=""0""/>
<xs:element name=""Request"" ref=""tns:UrlInfoRequest"" minOccurs=""0"" maxOccurs=""unbounded""/>
</xs:sequence>
</xs:complexType>
</xs:element>

<xs:element name=""UrlInfoRequest"">
<xs:complexType>
<xs:sequence>
<xs:element name=""ResponseGroup"" type=""xs:string"" minOccurs=""0""/>
<xs:element name=""Url"" type=""xs:string""/>
</xs:sequence>
</xs:complexType>
</xs:element>

If you are "".Net"" user, you may not required to modify WSDL.
I modified reference file like this:

[System.Xml.Serialization.XmlElementAttribute(""UrlInfoRequest"")] 

FIX:
[System.Xml.Serialization.XmlElementAttribute(""Request"")] 


FYI: More fix in the WSDL, see this post.

<FONT face=""Times New Roman"" size=3>Losing the ECS Medium Image after it existed.</FONT>
I don't blame Amazon or the AWS Team .... And this has nothing to do with the Seasons, The Fall, The Winter, the cold changing garments, etc ...
This is sheer madness and chaos !!
Perhaps this is the indiscipline of a Brand that has always been chaotic in Apparel. The champion of Anarchy and changing everything everyday.
The Spiegel Apparel brand loses images in ECS like this one :
http://xml.amazon.com/onca/xml?Service=AWSECommerceService&Operation=ItemLookup&Style=http%3A//www.gamefant.com/vico.xslt&ContentType=text/html&SubscriptionId=&ltAccess Key Removed>&ItemId=B000623G1W&IdType=ASIN&MerchantId=All&ResponseGroup=Large,VariationSummary&Version=2004-10-04
Previously the Garment Image was shown ( a Sweater ) ...
Now it is lost in ECS for XSLT.
Spiegel has always been the champion of indiscipline changing Asin number with extraordinary frequency and killing big collections for a week or fifteen days.... Later they appear with changed ASIN number and later all the resurrected collection is killed once again for days or weeks.
I am not talking about all Spiegel Products but a good percentage.
While other champions of indiscipline have been corrected and are now good kids, Spiegel seems every day worse in behaviour.
The AWS Team has done a wonderful job with ECS ... This is magic and its performance and reliability is extraordinary. But the employees of a brand can do a lot to discredit ECS by erasing the images or killing collections without any explanation.
Later the resurrection of the dead is killed once again. This is an absurd game of ""Out of Stock"" . Intermittent and Crazy !! ( Not continuous or stable )
I don't see how Amazon is benefited with this erratic behaviour.

This is very grave dear friends :
Spiegel erased hundreds of products that had ECS XSLT images.
I use the Medium XSLT image in my AMZN Apparel Pages.
Those products have been erased and resurrected many times and many often.
Now the resurrection occurs without ECS XSLT Images.
Spiegel was a model of having good ECS XSLT Images.

But Apparel ECS seems very slow today Wednesday.
I don't blame Amazon. I am located in Colombia, South America.
It is so slow that some garments never arrive, but produce no error.
And dirty errors are higher than yesterday Tuesday ( but discounting the two brief collapses of Tuesday ) There are a few ugly minutes and many minutes of perfection.
I love Amazon and I have high trust in the AWS Team and the Programmers.
What we need is that Top Management at AMZN gives the necessary Computer Servers, Super Disks, Super Modems and Super Material for a Happy Halloween to Christmas ECS Service.
The necessary electronic and programming materials should be apportioned to avod high loads of visitors that drive the ECS System to its knees.
And some regard for little bees too \!!!

Hi Friends :
Using the Examples that Elena kindly has made public for all of us in this thread :
Scratchpad - code samples auto generated
http://forums.prospero.com/n/mb/message.asp?webtag=am-assocdevxml&msg=6472.1&ctx=0
Then I built my own simplified XSLT sytlesheet and I published it on the same thread of the link that I posted above. It is just my reduced stylesheet version of what Elena posted.
Thinks have worked generally well. I converted many of my Apparel Pages using my reduced stylesheet. Most days the rate of failure of my XML-XSLT calls is very low 1% or 2%, but some days like today Thursday the errors are unusually High 5% to 10% of calls. 
At the same time I have been unable to find a single error in XSLT 3.0 ( for books and DVDs ) during the last three months. And I am an obsessive neurotic and compulsive checker of Datafeeds in my Pages.
Also many images are missing in several brands of Apparel. Some descriptions in Newport News Swimsuits are ""very dirty"" with tags like <li> and other tags.
I am somewhat ashamed of asking for help here, but I am forced by economic cirncunstances to work as a Consultant outside in Factories and Offices and therefore I lack time to devote to studying these things of XSLT 4.0
My Amazon revenue is not enought to justify FULL TIME.
Has someone examples of XSLT 4.0 for Apparel ??
Can we force the link to Item Datafeed  in Elena's Stylesheet sample to open in a New Window, instead of the same Window ???
And if I am calling the garment from an <iframe> tag, Can I force the link to invade all the window ??? ( Maximized Window ) instead of the datafeed appearing only inside the <iframe> ???
Can we get the availability ??? ..... Can we get the colors and sizes ???  ....  By automatic datafeed ??? 
I apologize again to all Associate and to Amazon if I appear as a parasite bloodsucker. As a sort of Apparel XSLT Dracula sucking the work and effort of others, but I really can not devote time to studying a lot of manuals and documentation. I need examples.
I love Amazon, the Apparel and the Associates. And I plan to stay here. 
Besides I am an incorrigible optimist that thinks that things ( and sales ) are going to improve a lot in the future and that we better be stubborn as mules. I am an innate believer in ""EL Dorado"" and the ""Seven Cities of Gold"" and maybe I am right !!
I also think that Amazon is going to improve the servers for Apparel XSLT 4.0 and that they are going to work so perfectly in the future as XSLT 3.0 does now for Books and DVDs, where things never fail and there is no 'throttling' for little Honeybees like me.
Thanks for any help

Is there any existing search engine where we could see the results that this engine would be giving?
The alexa.com site is still using google, right?
I can't tell if I am doing something wrong (which I don't think I am), or if the search results are really going to be this bad!?!
I did really simple searches for things like ""lion king"", ""real estate"", ""online stock advice"" and all the results were complete junk.  Most of the results seem to be google directory (i.e. DMOZ) entries.  What's up with that?
If search results can be anywhere close to as relevant as those on the current Alexa.com site, then there is the opportunity for some really neat stuff to be built.  But, if the results I am seeing are the *real* results to be returned by this engine, then there is no hope.  I certainly hope it is the former ..."

You can play with AWIS in this beta demo:
http://find24x7.com/?q=canon+powershot
the whole a9's general websearch tendency and the market protection from Amazon.com creates a huge niche for AWIS. There are still relevancy issues, but I hope Alexa will take full advantage of this context

Vicente to Dan :
There is a terrible issue with missing images in Apparel, Perhaps half the images are not returned by Automatic Datafeed .... Important collections like Newport News have most of the images hidden from view for ECS.
This ECS Apparel Release seems to me like a Crude Beta was forced in order to please Wall Street Investors or someone else at the top of the Chain Food.
The Price Chart for the Amazon Share is appalling :
From $64.00 to $38.54 in the last year.
Take a look at the Price Chart for a Year :

Type attributes are missing in some element decralations in the WSDL.
