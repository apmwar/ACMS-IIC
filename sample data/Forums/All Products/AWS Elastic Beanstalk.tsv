AWS Elastic Beanstalk	"eb deploy returns ERROR: FileNotFoundError
I have a Node app that I deploy with the EB CLI.
After building my project I execute `eb deploy` and I get the following output:

Hi minexus,

Sorry you are unable to deploy with eb deploy.

It's hard to tell what the problem is, however, can you tell me what kind of a file /home/franciscohanna92/Proyectos/minexus/admin-app/ node_modules/terser-webpack-plugin/node_modules/acorn-dynamic-import/node_modules/.bin/acorn is?

Is it a symlink, and if so, does it point to anything?

Thanks,

Hi minexus,

Please let me know if the upgrade to 3.14.13 fixes your problem.

AWS Elastic Beanstalk	"Files Lost on Reboot
Hello. I am relatively new to AWS but have a couple of EC2 instances deployed with Elastic Beanstalk running Wordpress where I have installed the MySQL database on a RDS instance. The problem I am having is every time I have to reboot the instance for some reason it seems to revert to old versions of files and/or I lose some files entirely. I am forced to upload files from a local backup to get my site back online with the current content. 

So my question is: is this normal behavior? I am wondering with EB if it is redeploying the Running Version image I last uploaded by default on reboot or if there is something else going on. If it is the latter, how can I go about finding the files that are either missing or have been replaced by old versions?

Thank you."
AWS Elastic Beanstalk	"""eb deploy"" does not consider environment variables since 3.14.11
Hi everyone!

We got problems with our continuous deployment and it seems to be related to the new release. We got the following output:

$ eb use XXX
WARNING: Git is in a detached head state. Using branch ""default"".
WARNING: Git is in a detached head state. Using branch ""default"".
ERROR: CredentialsError - Operation Denied. You appear to have no credentials


The build was running with environment variables AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY set.

These variables are expected to override any configuration as documented here:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html

Seems to be a bug, doesn't it?

Cheers,

Christopher"
AWS Elastic Beanstalk	"Re: ""eb deploy"" does not consider environment variables since 3.14.11
Hi christopher-cp ,

I am curious to know if you are continuing to see the problem. I am unable to reproduce the problem. Specifically, I have been able to verify that:
1. The `--profile` argument takes precedence over everything else
2. The environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` take precedence over everything else except `--profile` (that is, eb use --profile PROFILE` will disregard the env. vars.)

I am curious to know what `eb use --debugboto` shows you? Which profile exactly do you see requests being attempted with? You can determine this through a find operation inside the terminal on the substring ""AKIA"".

Thanks,
Rahul."
AWS Elastic Beanstalk	"Re: ""eb deploy"" does not consider environment variables since 3.14.11
Hi Rahul,

thanks for your message!

Let me show you our deploy script (we use Gitlab-CI) first:

    - pip install awsebcli
    - mkdir -p ~/.aws
    - echo '[profile eb-cli]' >> ~/.aws/config
    # bug start: due to a bug introduced in awsebcli 3.14.11
    - echo ""aws_access_key_id = $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"" >> ~/.aws/config
    - echo ""aws_secret_access_key = $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"" >> ~/.aws/config
    # bug end
    - eb use XXX
    - eb deploy


As you can see we don't use the ""--profile"" flag. But: there is a profile name in "".elasticbeanstalk/config.yml"" (key: ""global.profile""). I guess this must also be the reason why we need to create a "".aws/config"". Does the property have the highest priority? Is it handled like ""--profile""?

Cheers,

Christopher"
AWS Elastic Beanstalk	"Re: ""eb deploy"" does not consider environment variables since 3.14.11
Thanks for your response, and for sharing further details with me, Christopher.

1. The bug you are experiencing introduced in 3.14.11 was unintended. We were trying to fix another credential-related problem (where the `--profile` argument wasn't respected in the presence of env. vars.). I apologize that it has caused your CI system to fail.

2. The EBCLI's behaviour is to use the value for `profile` present in .elasticbeanstalk/config.yml even if environment variables for the same are available. During (and only during) `eb init`, this gets set to `eb-cli` by the EBCLI if a `--profile` is not explicitly passed. This subsequently gets set in .elasticbeanstalk/config.yml as the global profile for subsequent use (for instance, during `eb use`).

3. The fix for the bug should be that the EBCLI not create a `eb-cli` credential pair when env. vars. for the access ID and secret key are available during `eb init`. This change shouldn't be a problem, however, it needs to be thought through before being committed to and made.

4. Notwithstanding 3., for the time being, if you intend on using EBCLI 3.14.11, you can bypass the bug by setting the value for profile in .elasticbeanstalk/config.yml to `null` after `eb init`. Is `eb init` something you need to perform time and again on Gitlab-CI? If not, the manual change to .elasticbeanstalk/config.yml should be a one-time thing and hence feasible, even though I wish you didn't have to do it.

Thanks,
Rahul."

AWS Elastic Beanstalk	"Elastic Beanstalk is auto-generating insecure (open SSH) Security Groups
TLDR: Elastic Beanstalk is auto-generating insecure Security Groups that accept SSH requests from all IPs. This happens every time I create an environment within a VPC, despite the VPCs security group that limits ssh access.

I currently have a single subnet VPC (see ""Scenario 1: VPC with a Public Subnet Only"") created with a custom security group attached that locks down the inbound SSH requests to only accept my IP address. It looks like:

SSH | TCP | 22 | 12.34.56.78/32


When I create a new environment with my VPC, or when I rebuild an existing environment in Elastic Beanstalk it appears that a new Security Group is created specifically for this environment. Question 1:: Why is this happening? What is the purpose of this environment-specific Security Group?

Since my VPC already has a security group, all instances appear to now have two security groups. One from the VPC and the auto-generated environment security group. Attempting to remove the auto-generated environment security group in Elastic Beanstalk seems to have no-effect - it just re-adds itself.

Now the real kicker is the auto-generated environment security group has the following inbound rules:

SSH | TCP | 22 | 0.0.0.0/0
HTTP | TCP | 80 | 0.0.0.0/0


This nullifies all the SSH and HTTP rules I added to the VPCs security group, opening up my instance to everyone. It appears I can edit this auto-generated security group to remove this inbound rules, but every time I create a new environment, or rebuild an existing one a new auto-generated environment security group is created with these rules again. This make securing my environment a very difficult game of whack-a-mole. Surely I'm missing something?

Question 2: Is this expected behavior? Is this a bug? What's the purpose? How do I set secure firewall rules without having to rewrite them every time I create or rebuild a new environment?

Thanks,
David

AWS Elastic Beanstalk	"Re: Elastic Beanstalk is auto-generating insecure (open SSH) Security Groups
NOTE: this has now been superceeded by the option setting SSHSourceRestriction from here:
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/command-options.html

Hello there,

To answer your questions:
1.  This is a feature in Elastic Beanstalk. If you specify a SSH keypair in your Beanstalk environment, the security group you are referring to will be generated.

2.  The solution to suppress this behaviour is to:
Set up your elasticbeanstalk envionment without setting the SSH key in the web console, this will prevent the security group in question from being created with the default rule allowing SSH from 0.0.0.0/0, which is of special concern on EC2 based environments as it exposes SSH to the entire Internet.

Then the SSH setup can be done using ebextensions. The ebextensions config file to do this is:

option_settings:
  - namespace: aws:cloudformation:template:resource:property
    resource_name: AWSEBAutoScalingLaunchConfiguration
    option_name: KeyName
    value: Name of the SSH key


Just replace ""Name of the SSH key"" with the name of the SSH key.

For more information on .ebextensions config files, please see:
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/customize-containers-ec2.html

For the SSH part I recommend this:

Is there a way to call the Keyname value through EBS setting? That way, it will allow us to move the build around to different region for a different project.

AWS Elastic Beanstalk	"Re: Elastic Beanstalk is auto-generating insecure (open SSH) Security Groups
while we now have the SSHSourceRestriction the sec groups seems to always get created no matter if an SSH key is spec'ed or not.

and the problem persists that the other ports are unrestricted and there is no (or i have not found them) means to limit them w/o 
 - diving into mod'ing the beanstalk cloudformation scripts OR
 - putting restriction on the SGs in a post process

modding via CF works like so: 
# contents of file file .ebextensions/10-limit-sg.config

note 
1. that the SG i used here has no in/out bound rules, so basically is a no-op as i do all the config in my own created managed SGs that i add to the EB ENV anyhow
2. u must redefine the rules for the ports with smth., you cant remove or set either of the rule lists to empty []

AWS Elastic Beanstalk	"Please add ssl support for single instances (without load balancer)
AWS Team, you are creating really amazing stuff with all that little services. It's really awesome, but, why are you not able to manage ssl protected single instances for elastic beanstalk? It cannot be that hard for you guys.

There are so many devs which only want to host a prototype or a small project which probably will never have the need to use a load balancer. Most people just add it to have easy ssl support. Thats the reason for extra 20$ per month... per APP(!). Thats not worth it. The majority of my costs is just that not needed load balancer.

There are some ""solutions"" with .ebextensions but it's very dirty and did not work and it's not the aws way to add ssl.

I will move my current beanstalk infrastructure to a small cheap vserver, which supports letsencrypt out of the box until there is a way to get affortable ssl for small beanstalk projects.

This is exactly the way you should do it and how many others (like me) do it (in case you have a single instance). For such cases there is a .ebextensions folder. If you move your current beanstalk infrastructure to a small cheap vserver, you have to do it the same way? :P"

What I mean is, that a lot of people use AWS because it's easy. You just deploy your app and its running, without having to configure a server. To do it with .ebextensions is not the easy way I like to have, when I am using a service like Elastic Beanstalk.
You can have ssl by just clicking around, but with extra cost of 20/25$ per month. Why not without the load balancer?

No I dont have to do the ""same"". There is Plesk and I just can add an SSL by one click and it's done. And the VServer costs me 3$ per month."

It has been my understanding based on the documentation available that this is the best way to do zero downtime deployments on the Elastic Beanstalk platform. In practice however we have noticed that services dependent on the service being deployed will sometimes receive 500 codes for brief periods while the deployment is happening.

AWS Elastic Beanstalk	"Beanstalk Auto Scaling Group terminating healthy instance during deployment
Hello,

We are running several Elastic Beanstalk apps doing immutable deploys, currently with just one instance in each environment (auto scaling group set to min: 1, max: 1). Just in the past week, we've suddenly started having unexpected downtime during our deploys, and it appears to be because the EB permanent auto scaling group is terminating the new instances as soon as they become healthy and are attached. This happens about the same time as the old healthy instance is terminated, which results in downtime. The auto scaling group sees that there are 0 instances running in the group, and finally starts up another instance which ends the downtime when it becomes healthy.

It looks like the auto scaling group is terminating instances in an attempt to balance across AZs or to react to our Cloudwatch Alarms. Is there any way to have it ignore these triggers during Beanstalk deployments, or at least wait to take any actions until the deployment has completed? We pretty much never want the autoscaling group to do anything other than handle the immutable deploy while a new version is being applied.

These are the sort of logs we're seeing from EB and the auto scaling groups:

AWS Elastic Beanstalk	"How to Deploy EBS Internally at Amazon!!!
Hi Everyone,

I work at Amazon Consumer, in the Finance Department. I am trying to deploy a Flask app internally at Amazon. As I am not a developer, the standard tools of deploying apps, looks really really hard. I hosted demo sites on EBS before, and really love the service.

How can I get started using EBS at Amazon, and control access via LDAP?"
AWS Elastic Beanstalk	"EB creates a Security Group with ports 80, 22 open; is it needed?
Whenever I create a new Environment of a single-instance (not load balanced) multiple-container Docker type, EB creates a security group with the same name as the environment, which allows inbound traffic to ports 80 and 22 from 0.0.0.0. This is in addition to the custom security group I specify during environment setup.

If I try to remove the SG from the instances configuration screen (leaving only my custom SG), the update succeeds but the autogenerated SG is not actually removed.

This is a private service and I want its SG to allow access only from select IPs (i.e. from other SGs). So every time I create a new environment, I have to edit this autogenerated security group. And there's a security risk in forgetting to do this someday.

Is there a way to make EB not create this SG? Is it needed for any EB functionality, or is it just a default setup? Can anything stop working because I disable these rules?"
AWS Elastic Beanstalk	"Re: EB creates a Security Group with ports 80, 22 open; is it needed?
Hi,

I just had a quick look at this and it seems this is the default setup for when launching with EB:

http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/using-features.managing.ec2.html

Search for ""security Group"" and you will see this entry:

Elastic Beanstalk creates a default security group for you. If you are using a legacy container, the security group is elasticbeanstalk-default. If you are using a non-legacy container, then Elastic Beanstalk dynamically creates a security group. You can view the security group name in the EC2 security group box.

Note:
If you are running your application using a legacy container type, make sure port 80 (HTTP) is accessible from 0.0.0.0/0 as the source CIDR range if you want to enable health checks for your application. For more information about health checks, see Health Checks. To check if you are using a legacy container type, see Why are some container types marked legacy?.

Cheers,

Stooby..."
AWS Elastic Beanstalk	"Re: EB creates a Security Group with ports 80, 22 open; is it needed?
I had the same question. My understanding is that if you specify an EC2 key pair in the environment setup, then the auto generated security group has the port 22 open."
AWS Elastic Beanstalk	"Re: EB creates a Security Group with ports 80, 22 open; is it needed?
AWS support showed me that the elastic beanstalk extensions also allow the load balancer security group to be specified explicitly, which will replace the TCP:80 0.0.0.0/0 and TCP:443 0.0.0.0/0 rules. 

In a .config file inside .ebextensions you can include
 - namespace: aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration
    option_name: SSHSourceRestriction
    value: tcp,22,22,127.0.0.1/32
  - namespace: aws:elbv2:loadbalancer
    option_name: ManagedSecurityGroup
    value: sg-12345
  - namespace: aws:elbv2:loadbalancer
    option_name: SecurityGroups
    value: sg-12345,sg-67890


Where sg-12345 is the id of the security group you'd like to both attach to the load balancer, and have the autoscaled EC2 instances point to as a security group source. The above options allow for KeyPair to be associated with the EC2 instances if desired. Included also is the option to overrule the TCP:22 0.0.0.0/0 security rule added to each EC2 instance."
AWS Elastic Beanstalk	"Re: EB creates a Security Group with ports 80, 22 open; is it needed?
Hi,

I understand you would like to replace default security group with your pre-defined security group for environment. If I misunderstand, please correct me.

Removing the default security group is not possible in Elastic Beanstalk. This is an expected behavior so as to allow SSH access (if selected during environment creation) and HTTP access to the instances.

However, you can always adding additional security groups from the console and using option settings to the Auto Scaling group of your environment. Please reference to these documents[1][2] for more detail. 

Also, even though removing default security group is not allowed, it still can be modified. You can reach this either by modify security group in EC2 console or .ebextensions. You can check out these document for more detail.

Hope above helps you. If you have any further question, please feel free to let me know.

AWS Elastic Beanstalk	"customized wsgi.conf is wiped out if we update any environment variables
We are using a customized Apache wsgi.conf for a Python/Elastic Beanstalk app. The customizations are necessary because we want to make changes to the VirtualHost containing the WSGI app, such as access control, rewrite rules, etc., and there doesn't appear to be another way to accomplish this.

Following the example of many others here, we use a container command to modify wsgi.conf in the ondeck directory. The command runs during an app deployment and modifies the file; subsequent phases of the deployment copy the file into place and restart apache.

The problem comes if we update the environment configuration via the EB console -- for instance, to change the value of an environment variable. In this case, the change triggers a config deployment, which regenerates wsgi.conf using the new settings, but which does not run any container commands or otherwise provide an obvious way to preserve our changes. We wind up with a vanilla config that does not include any of our customizations. Our only option seems to be to only update configuration variables on a standby environment, and always follow up with an app deployment before swapping URLs, in order to re-customize the apache config.

It would be great if there were a way around this -- e.g., having a way to customize the APACHE_TEMPLATE variable defined in the EB hook configuration, or being able to specify commands to run for a configdeploy, or if the VirtualHost contained an Include directive for loading customer maintained files from a specific directory. Is there a better way to handle this today, or is this just a sign that I finally need to make the leap to OpsWorks or another chef- or puppet-based solution?"

Yes, we are using a config file in .ebextensions. The modification step is part of container_commands. The command runs a script, included in our unpacked source bundle, that modifies ""../wsgi.conf"" in place.

Currently when you deploy a new config, your eb-extensions do not run.

Hi DhanviK@AWS,

Is this going to be fixed eventually? I'm running into the same issue. I have the following container command which copies a custom wsgi.conf during deployment:

04_wsgiconf:

If I update the environment variables, the custom wsgi.conf is overwritten. To me this seems like a bug since a configuration change shouldn't need a new deployment. This breaks our HTTP to HTTPS redirection which can have serious consequences.

Is there any hope of resolution to this issue? Is there a more appropriate way to configure WSGI in EB?  The default configuration prevents basic web application functionality, like authorization using the Authorization header. Requiring a redeploy following any configuration change means significant downtime where functionality is broken, and is error prone. Please provide a way to properly configure WSGI in a way that's consistent and reliable."
AWS Elastic Beanstalk	"Re: customized wsgi.conf is wiped out if we update any environment variables
A better solution is to add a new file like ""/etc/httpd/conf.d/wsgi_custom.conf"" that will also be included in the Apache configs. That file will not get wiped when changing settings.

We have this in our .ebextensions

files:
  ""/etc/httpd/conf.d/wsgi_custom.conf"":

This isn't all that helpful either because the virtual host beanstalk creates automatically is what needs to be updated in many cases (like for HTTPS redirection). Unless I'm wrong, the additional file is processed separately and not inside that VirtualHost context."

I created a script to add a hook to the config update operation.
This script will be executed after /opt/elasticbeanstalk/hooks/configdeploy/pre/01generate.py
and will modify the staging wsgi.conf

We can directly modify wsgi.conf in this script, or use apache IncludeOptional to include a directory

This is working great for me: https://rickchristianson.wordpress.com/2013/11/02/updating-wsgi-automatically-in-amazon-aws/

Here's the gist in case the URL ever breaks:

container_commands:
  01_wsgireplace:
      command: 'cp wsgi.conf ../wsgi.conf'


So, you just put your custom wsgi in your root directory (or anywhere you want and modify the cp) and copy it up one level which will be /opt/python/ondeck. When the flip command executes it will copy yours instead of the generated one."
AWS Elastic Beanstalk	"Re: customized wsgi.conf is wiped out if we update any environment variables
Having the same issue with tomcat/apach in ELB. Either env update or app server reboot will wipe any customized settings from the .ebtensions . Very annoying but do not have good solution."
AWS Elastic Beanstalk	"Re: customized wsgi.conf is wiped out if we update any environment variables
This one is a tough nut to crack; I had the same problem and set out to solve it.  Part of the problem is that if you try to do it with container_commands, your commands run too late in some cases, and as many have discovered, even when this works (on the second and subsequent deploys), it doesn't help with configuration deployments.

My solution was to use 'files' to install a python script based on the EB's own config hook to /opt/elasticbeanstalk/local/ (you might prefer a different location), and 'commands' (not 'container_commands') to install that python script as a pre-hook to the appdeploy and configdeploy activities, which runs after the stock configuration pre-hook.  These directives are found in an .ebextensions config file.  Here's an example; put whatever you want in wsgi.conf inside MY_APACHE_TEMPLATE:

files:
  ""/opt/elasticbeanstalk/local/override_wsgi_conf.py"":
    mode: ""000755""

from vallejooo

This is common for applications which are public but don't have a lot of ""real"" traffic. Random bots out there scanning AWS's IP space for vulnerable wordpress installations etc. causing lots of 404s, the EB host sees those in its nginx proxy logs and flags the environment health. It doesn't take the node out of service or anything (if you're using autoscaling), it's just annoying. You can work around it with an .ebextension that essentially changes the error logging on the EB host to record the 4xx's as 200, but IMO better to just leave it and know that once you start getting real traffic, the % of requests which are false will be low enough to not trigger the warning.

Hello Mark. 

You are right. If you deploy the same code base (including the same config file) to both environments, then the same variables will be passed to both environments. 

I'm not aware of any conditional logic that is present within the .ebextensions config files but I'll be happy to research this for you. 

In the meantime, you can always create two code bases for the different environments (with different config files within each). This is actually the way that I would proceed, but if you want to keep everything unified then I can research the issue a bit for you.

AWS Elastic Beanstalk	"Re: environment specific config
Conditional logic is something we absolutely need inside .ebextensions file. Actually, when creating multiple environmenets, you actually push the same code.

AWS Elastic Beanstalk	"Re: environment specific config
Thanks Brandon,

We use git so development is the develop branch and production is the master branch, having to create more than one repository/codebase for each environment doesn't makes sense and certainly goes against most SCM and deployment pipeline philosophies.

I do think environment specific .ebextensions would be really helpful. Something like 
.ebextensions/10.shared.config
.ebextensions/productionEnv/10.justforprod.config
.ebextensions/development/10.justfordev.config

I believe it's possible to use a combination of .ebextensions and .elasticbeanstalk/optionssettings.production to set some environment specific variables. A Ruby on Rails app seems to support using vars like, RAILS_ENV/RACK_ENV in the hard-coded list of environment variables. For Node, I'm limited to PARAM1-5. It feels really weird to have code like this,
 
if (process.env.PARAM1) { 
    process.env.NODE_ENV = process.env.PARAM1;
}


There are certainly workarounds, but it feels like this should absolutely be supported in a more native fashion. Thanks."

You're not really limited to param1-5. You can add whatever environment variables you like via .ebextensions or the management console.

What I'd be interested in is how you would determine if the environment were prod or test. Even in our sample code, we expect that NODE_ENV is changed from production to development or something to change the workflow of your code. 

Also, I'd like to know what you have in the dev/test specific configs. If you do set environment variables, and you're running commands/container_commands, you can always use the test function built into those two things. However, that's really the only conditional logic we have in there. All configs are supposed to run every time with the current design of everything.

AWS Elastic Beanstalk	"Re: environment specific config
Thanks for the response Hubert,

You're right, I should probably be setting NODE_ENV external to the .ebextensions config, especially given that there's no easy way to target .ebextensions to a specific environment. Currently, I'm doing this via .elasticbeanstalk/optionsettings.env-name, but I have to do so via PARAM1, since in this context I am limited to PARAM1-5, I realize I have greater flexibility using .ebextensions option_settings. Then, in my server code I'm looking for process.env.PARAM1 and setting NODE_ENV accordingly. Alternatively I might be able to do something like, NODE_ENV=development node server, via the container options, Node Command. I might also try that. I think that I could also just set NODE_ENV via the console and remove it from .ebextensions/option_settings and it will remain unaffected so a console only solution would also work, but that seems like a manual task that I'd forget to do again at some point in the future.

I understand that you don't really want to commit something like NODE_ENV into source control, since it changes based on environment. That being said, if you did support environment specific .ebextensions it would facilitate easier sharing of environment configuration between team members.

Also, I'm doing some nginx configuration overrides by copying files into /etc/nginx/conf.d, using the Files feature of .ebextensions. This works great, but again, I had to work around an issue where I wanted to enact slightly different overrides between development/production, env specific .ebextensions would have been easier.

Regardless, I've managed to work around all of my issues for the time being. Thanks for the help."
AWS Elastic Beanstalk	"Re: environment specific config
Logic isn't required IMO, what if we just had the whole config file namespaced based on the EB environment name, and a fall-through for everything that should be done across all environments?

Here's an example:

(Currently we're limited to this)
packages:
  yum:
    git: []
    gcc: []
    make: []
    openssl-devel: []
  rpm:
    gm: ftp://ftp.graphicsmagick.org/pub/GraphicsMagick/linux/GraphicsMagick-1.3.19-1.src.rpm


But we could be doing this:

development-env:
  packages:
    yum:
      staging-only-package: []
staging-env,production-env:
  packages:
    yum:
      production-package: []
default:
  packages:
    yum:
      git: []
      gcc: []
      make: []
      openssl-devel: []

Hi everyone,

I'm starting using AWS beanstalk and came naturally to the same need : having different config for my environments (dev, staging and production).
After some search and test here is finally what I'm going to do :

I've created my production environment using eb command line and set up all my environment variables via the console the first time.

Once all is ok, I've saved my environment config
eb config save

Running this command will generate a file under .elasticbeanstalk/saved-configs directory. AND it will also save this file in your beanstalk S3 bucket.

Looking closer at my .gitignore file, I can see that my saved-configs directory will be ignored. Which suit me well because I don't want to store environment variables values in my SCM.

And here I am. I can do the same for my development and staging environments.

One thing that we need to remind is that we need to update our environment config files as soon as we change something : environment, setting, version upgrade,...

But this way of doing things seems to me a good way :

I can define and save specific environment files
These files are not commited to my SCM


Hope this can help somebody."

Also, I'd like to know what you have in the dev/test specific configs.

In my case, we're trying to migrate a massive Drupal multisite--170 sites with 170 domains and 170 databases running on a single codebase--from Acquia hosting to AWS.  We also have a number of sites hosted on Pantheon.  Pantheon and Acquia are hosting platforms targeted at Drupal specifically.

Both Acquia and Pantheon provide a three-environment deployment pipeline: dev->test->prod.  Each environment has its own distinct set of databases and CMS-managed media files.  Fresh commits to the master branch in version control automatically deploy to the dev environment.  Then a dashboard button or command line command ships the same code ""forward"" to the test environment and production environment.

In our AWS pilot, we have an RDS instance for databases and an EFS share for the CMS-managed media files.. the Dev & Test environments share an RDS and EFS instance, and production is to have its own distinct RDS and EFS instances.  We're using CodePipeline to implement the deployment pipeline.

I'm using .ebextensions to set up security group ingress rules and to mount the EFS file share to the EC2 containers.  Since the different environments have different EFS filesystems and security groups and so on, I need my .ebextensions configurations to be ""environmentally aware"", so to speak.

We want to use Elastic Beanstalk for the autoscaling functionality and for the managed OS-level updates and so on--to achieve feature-parity with what Acquia/Pantheon are providing us currently (at the cost of roughly 1 full time developer's salary, so there's obvious savings here if we can migrate to AWS).

Our AWS contact is currently researching how to achieve this ""environmental awareness"" and will get back to us next week, but we have to have to decide whether we're going to pay Acquia for another year of hosting by mid-November so... ....

Hi Brian,

What was the answer from your AWS contact?
What did you decide in the end?

Thanks."
AWS Elastic Beanstalk	"Re: environment specific config
Ultimately, the solutions we found were going to be considerably more complicated than the functionality we've been asking about in this thread.

We ended up solving the problem without the desired dynamic .ebextensions functionality, using a combination of solutions:
a) 'Saved configurations' -- we created one per environment which could then be used to re-apply that environment's settings.  Most notably here were environment variables including an 'EB_ENVIRONMENT' variable which I wrote application code to consider.  I would want to verify that auto-scaling behaved as desired with this approach, but we never got to that point.
b) We used common security groups to obviate the need for some firewall rules.
c) We configured a post-deployment shell command which utilized the 'aws' command line utility to deploy a folder from an S3 bucket.  This folder contained per-site-environment include files with configuration including database credentials.  The application code then determined which of these files to include based on the EB_ENVIRONMENT variable and other factors.

This was a stopgap approach we pursued in the interest of time in lieu of a more-proper solution.  We emerged with something that worked, but my group ultimately decided not to go through with the migration due to the amount of work it would take to cut over all of our sites before the deadline with proper verification of success and viable rollback plan, so we didn't further investigate a proper solution.

I think some combination of CloudFormation and/or an off-the-shelf configuration management system like Ansible, Puppet, or Chef would have been the way to solve this properly.

.ebextensions does provide these functions for dynamically referencing AWS resources and attributes: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/ebextensions-functions.html
These may have been able to ultimately get us where we needed to go, but knowing the right syntax and identifiers to use seemed like it was going to take a lot of time, trial, and error.

Here's a few links I had saved which I thought may be relevant to the Ref/GetAtt functions I linked above. I don't know which of these is truly relevant to that approach:

AWS Elastic Beanstalk	"[Critical] Problems Deploying any application version
Hi guys,

We are hitting a critical problem with one of our main Applications running on top of Elastic Beanstalk on SA Region.

As soon as a new deploy finishes and the new instances gets the ""OK"" state, they immediately switch to ""Severe"" state and deploy start to fail.

On the debugging process, we first suspected of this being a connection issue against a Redis on ElastiCache, one of the first connections our app does. But then we realized we couldn't connect by ssh to the instances, although they continue to write logs on CloudWatch Logs.

The issue happens when running a Managed Update, or a new deploy. We suspect there is some kind of deployment-id limit or so. We had no issues adding more instances to the environment by manually changing AutoScaling Group parameters (changing the ""desired"" from 8 to 16 instances), confirming that it's not a connection limit issue with other components of the system.

Can you help us debugging this issue? Is critical as we cannot make code changes on our application due to this problem.

An easy workaround to delete the underlying CloudFormation stack of Elastic Beanstalk environment and terminating the environment. 

If you face difficulty in deleting the CloudFormation stack, delete it by retaining the resource in DELETE_FAILED state and then terminate the environment.

Below are the steps which you might need to perform:

2. Click on Actions --> Delete Stack
3. Select the check boxes for the displayed resources and retain them, click on delete.

I have a WordPress install on Beanstalk with EC2 and RDS. I'm very new to AWS. Yesterday the site became unresponsive and had a status of 'No data received from the instance'.

Thank you"
AWS Elastic Beanstalk	"Re: Bug with describe-configuration-settings and SSHSourceRestriction
Thank you for posting this issue on AWS Forum. As discussed with you on a support case, this is indeed a known bug which has already been reported by few of our customers. The Elastic Beanstalk service team is currently working to resolve this issue. I have also successfully replicated this behaviour and can see that the value that is being returned by AWS CLI describe command is not correct. 

I have added your voice on this issue as well as my findings to our internal Elastic Beanstalk team. However, we can't provide you an ETA when this issue will be fixed. Please keep an eye on AWS ""What's New"" [1] and Elastic Beanstalk release notes [2]. When this issue will be fixed you will find an update there.

Based on my testing the workaround which I would suggest is to create Elastic Beanstalk environment in default VPC and use the below ebextension config file to set 'SSHSourceRestriction' option_settings:

option_settings:
  - namespace:  aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration
    option_name:  SSHSourceRestriction
    value:  ""tcp, 22, 22, my-security-group""


The environments which you create in default VPC only accepts security group name instead of ID as defined in the above configuration - i.e.. 'my-security-group'. After applying this option_settings when you describe the environment settings you will get the response like below:

        {
            ""OptionName"": ""SSHSourceRestriction"",
            ""Namespace"": ""aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration"",
            ""Value"": ""tcp,22,22,my-security-group""
        },


Replace the name 'my-security-group' in the provided configuration and try on your Elastic Beanstalk environment that is created in default VPC. I hope this helps.

AWS Elastic Beanstalk	"Re: Environment health has transitioned from Ok to Warning.
comcas,

This is coming from the new health monitoring system which monitors the Apache logs. 

To get more visibility into the details, I would monitor the environment using the EB CLI which has an option to see the details with the ""EB Health"" command (""EB Health --refresh"" to see a continuous view) and pull the logs either via the console or the EB CLI with ""EB Logs"" and look at the Apache logs to see the root cause of the server errors (http 500's). This is most likely a problem with your application.

The health system is telling you that a small percentage of the http requests to your site are failing between the apache web server and your application, so this could be something like a lack of PIOPs on a Dynamo DB table should you be using something like that.

AWS Elastic Beanstalk	"Re: Environment health has transitioned from Ok to Warning.
comcas,

0.8 % of the requests to the ELB are failing with HTTP 5xx (6 minutes ago).


Refers to 5xx error codes generated by ELB. ELB returns 5xx responses e.g. when the request rate exceeds the capacity of the instances. See explanation for HTTPCode_ELB_5XX at http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/elb-cloudwatch-metrics.html for details.

As David mentioned the new health monitoring system also monitors the Apache logs but in this case the warning is referring to the ELB failing to route the traffic to the instances for a small percentage of the requests.

The broken pipe errors in the Apache error logs where likely just some transient issues. If you see them continuously please let us know.

Hi,
thanks again for your replies.

My instances are usually receiving several requests and during the day there can be peaks.
I just scaled my application to use 3 t2.micro instances instead of 2 (one per AZ in ireland).

How can I get an idea of how many concurrent requests can handle a single instance?

Can you provide a suggestion on how to properly configure the scaling trigger? Currently I set it up to scale depending on cpu utilization, but doesn't seem to be working properly.

Thanks."
AWS Elastic Beanstalk	"Re: Environment health has transitioned from Ok to Warning.
comcas,

Application performance tuning is a pretty big subject  But I can give you a couple of suggestions.

If you believe you are in fact CPU bound and not constrained on some other resource, then using the EB CLI --refresh you can see the request rate that each instance is handling and the percentage of CPU that that request rate consumes on the instance. From that you can extrapolate the total number of requests the instance can handle when maxed out at say 90% CPU.

The other thing to do is clone your current environment with an instance count of 1 and drive test traffic to it while monitoring with the EB CLI. EB Scale 1 will lock it at one instance. You can then drive it until it breaks to see where that breaking point actually is and your http 500's start.

If your traffic is spiky it may not be exceeding the scale up threshold long enough to trigger an autoscaling scale up, so maybe take a look at how you have that configured.

You can also go into the monitoring section of the Beanstalk console to see the historical metrics of items like CPU%. If you need more visibility into more granular metrics, then you can go to the configuration >> Health section in the console and turn on any other metrics that you require for insight. Note there is a very small charge for any incremental metrics you may turn on.

I made a tool designed to enhance the security of EC2 servers by restricting what services can call the EC2 metadata service. This is to prevent e.g. RCE exploits from stealing EC2 credentials. Currently it lets requests through based on a whitelist of user-agents, but the elastic beanstalk scripts do not set their own user-agent, and thus uses quite a few different ones depending on what script is executing. It would be easier to whitelist these scripts in my tool if all EB scripts used consistent user-agents.

Hello,

I am able to confirm that you are utilizing AutoScaling in the eu-west-1 region. The reason why your EC2 instances are automatically terminating and launching new ones is due to an issue with the EC2 instances failing their EC2 health check. Upon reviewing the system log of the EC2 instances that were terminated recently(i-3ed788b6), it appears the EC2 instance/s are experiencing an OOM - Out of memory related issue. The specific error I am seeing can be seen below:

AWS Elastic Beanstalk	"Re: BeanStalk Application Load Balancer causes Red Health - EC2 Targets Healthy
I am experiencing the same issues.  No indications that I have seen as to why the status was changed to ""Red"".  The application is reachable over the beanstalk CNAME and via Route53 custom domain aliased to beanstalk CNAME.

I do have two listeners defined for the beanstalk stack.  One HTTP, the other HTTPS.  I am curious if there is a beanstalk health check which is trying to access the HTTPS listener and getting a DNS name mismatch on the certificate (it matches the Route53 name, but not the subdomain URL of the beanstalk CNAME).  If I try to browse to https:<beanstalkURL>, the app does come up... but first I have to accept the warning that the DNS of URL does not match that of the certificate (of course it does not).

This is an application load balancer.

Using the CLI to describe-environments... it shows Status of ""Ready"" and Health of ""Red""

My next step was going to be to add a rule to the HTTP listener and have it redirect all traffic to the HTTPS listener... but first trying to figure out why the stack is RED.  Plenty of posts about this... but have not found a solution yet.  Still looking, but would appreciate any help if someone has seen and solved something like this."
AWS Elastic Beanstalk	"Elastic Beanstalk application fails to deploy from CloudFormation
I have an Elastic Beanstalk application that I deploy through CloudFormation. Lately, when I push a change through my pipeline, it re-deploys the application (even if I didn't make changes to the anything related in the CloudFormation template), and the deployment always fails. I consistently get this in the Elastic Beanstalk events:
[Instance: i-001aeaa8311652246] Command failed on instance. Return code: 1 Output: (TRUNCATED)...l last): File ""/usr/bin/aws"", line 19, in <module> import awscli.clidriver File ""/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/awscli/clidriver.py"", line 19, in <module> from botocore.hooks import AliasedEventEmitter ImportError: cannot import name AliasedEventEmitter. command 03 in .ebextensions/log-stream.config failed. For more detail, check /var/log/eb-activity.log using console or EB CLI.


The config it's referring to sets up log streaming for a custom application log. Strangely though, if I go the Elastic Beanstalk console and rebuild the environment from there, it deploys correctly and I don't get any errors from that config. This happens every time my CloudFormation stack deploys and I don't want to have to manually rebuild the environment because of these strange failures. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!"
AWS Elastic Beanstalk	"Please explain the PHP Lifecycle on AWS Elastic Beanstalk
Hi,

I'm a Linux Sysadmin and used to run PHP applications via apache+mod_fcgid or apache/nginx+PHP-FPM.

When running PHP via apache mod_fcgid I can control the Lifecycle of the PHP processes.

For example I can set the following options inside Apache:

  FcgidMinProcessesPerClass 3
  FcgidMaxProcessesPerClass 25
  FcgidMaxProcesses 100
  FcgidIdleTimeout 60
  FcgidMaxRequestsPerProcess 50000
  FcgidProcessLifeTime 21600

Documentation: https://httpd.apache.org/mod_fcgid/mod/mod_fcgid.html

This will instruct Apache to run

-> at minimum 3 PHP processes per class/<Virtualhost>
-> at maximum 25 PHP processes per class/<Virtualhost>
-> at maximum 100 PHP processes in total
-> kill a PHP process (and start a new one if needed)
---> when the PHP process was idle for more than 60 seconds or
---> when the PHP process did handle 50000 requests or
---> when the PHP process was started more than 6 hours (21600s) ago

This way I can make sure not to overload the server via limiting the amount of PHP processes allowed to run in parallel to a sane amount. To combat possible memory leaks in PHP itself FcgidMaxRequestsPerProcess and FcgidProcessLifeTime are used.

A colleague of mine did migrate a PHP app - formerly running with the above configuration inside a hosted VM - to AWS Beanstalk.

They had autoscaling set to a maximum of only 1 instance. (This is surely not optimal but doesn't matter in this scenario). After two days uptime the instances did crash/became unresponsive because 100% of RAM was used (so they told me).

Of course they could have prevented this scenario with upscaling the number of instances handling the load but since I didn't find any info regarding PHP process lifecycle and support only gave ""your app seems to have a memory leak, please let the devs fix this"" as an explanation I want to understand how AWS is handling the PHP process lifecycle.

For example:

With my config from above my single server would only run 100 PHP processes in parallel, never more. When a visitor peak would occur and let's say 500 parallel requests were going to PHP then 100 would run in parallel and 400 requests would have to wait until some PHP processes have finished their job. This way it's not possible to serve more than 100 parallel PHP requests but the server would not get overloaded. Additionally, if there were a memory leak inside PHP or one of it's loaded extensions this would not be a big problem because mod_fcgid would kill each PHP process after a certain time or amount of requests served.

With AWS Elastic Beanstalk on the other hand it seems once started PHP processes are never terminated. So they will run a long time (days/weeks) and a memory leak will cause these long running processes to allocate more and more RAM.

My questions are:

1. Does AWS EB limit the amount of PHP processes running in parallel in one instance at all? E.G. will 500 parallel requests http://example.com/index.php result in 500 PHP processes running in the instance (let's assume ASG limit is still set to 1 server) or does AWS limit the amount of PHP processes somehow according to instance type?

2. Does AWS EB terminate PHP processes at all?

3. If ASG is configured to spin up more instances when load is rising there still will be a delay since upscaling isn't instant. Until the newly launched instances are up and added to the Load Balancer the remaining instances are still potentially brought to a halt if only enough requests are made in parallel so the instances are running many, many PHP processes in parallel, eventually exhausting all RAM and overloading the instance. is this correct?

I'm just trying to wrap my head around this.

Thanks a lot!"
AWS Elastic Beanstalk	"Instances stopped sending data
Hi, I'm trying to deploy a microservice on the Elastic Beanstalk but I'm experiencing a very strange case where everything works ok locally but seems to break when I actually deploy it. I test my container with eb local run
 and everything is fine, then I do {eb create} to deploy it, and it takes really long, usually I get this:
ERROR: TimeoutError - The EB CLI timed out after 10 minute(s). The operation might still be running. To keep viewing events, run 'eb events -f'. To set timeout duration, use '--timeout MINUTES'.

Eventually I can see it's deployed but it changes status from Ok, to Warning, to Severe, and then occasionally back to Ok etc.
My code is downloading a ~200MB file on init, and it seems to be the problem because the logs show it's doing it over and over again, like it's stuck in a loop or something. Here is the code that downloads a file:
s3client = boto3.client('s3', region_name=_aws_default_region, aws_access_key_id=_aws_key, aws_secret_access_key=_aws_secret)
            
size = float(s3client.head_object(Bucket=_aws_s3_bucket, Key=_aws_s3_bucket_path)['ContentLength'])
            
down_progress = progressbar.progressbar.ProgressBar(maxval=size)
down_progress.start()
 
def download_progress(chunk):
    down_progress.update(down_progress.currval + chunk)
 
try:
    s3client.download_file(_aws_s3_bucket, _aws_s3_bucket_path, 'tutti_im_inc_v1.h5', Callback=download_progress)
except botocore.exceptions.ClientError as e:
    if e.response['Error']['Code'] == ""404"":
        print(""The object does not exist."")
    else:
        raise
 
down_progress.finish()

I attache the log file so you can see how the file seems to be downloaded multiple times.
As I mentioned, everything works ok when run locally, but when deployed on the Beanstalk the instances stop sending data seconds after the deployment, and I can't even get the logs from the dashboard (it times out), only from the command line tool. Any help appreciated.

AWS Elastic Beanstalk	"How does the elastic beanstalk app exposes its EC2 instance's internal IP?
Hey everyone,

I've deployed a python/django app on elastic beanstalk. When I check logs, I see that kind of a web crawler scans my domain to find some php files vulnerable which is totally normal. But here is a problem here; only actual domain is allowed on django configuration. It gives an error when receives a request except from actual domain. The interesting thing is, some of these requests to elastic beanstalk app are comes from client to 172.31.**.** IP. This is internal IP of running EC2 instance. I'm not sure how is this happening. I've posted some part of the logs.

AWS Elastic Beanstalk	"Rails: How to get puma 3.11 for AWS Elasticbeanstalk application?
I am trying to deploy a Rails app on a new EC2 instance. EB is using puma 2.16.0 (which is 2 years old) instead of the version (3.11.0) I have defined in Gemfile.lock. This is a problem for me because the old puma version depends on an older version of rack gem. But one of my new dependency requires the latest version of rack gem

Current platform of EB: Puma with Ruby 2.3 running on 64bit Amazon Linux/2.4.4

So EB automatically uses the older puma and older rack version resulting in a conflict with my latest gems:

/opt/rubies/ruby-2.3.4/lib/ruby/gems/2.3.0/gems/bundler-1.15.0/lib/bundler/runtime.rb:317:in check_for_activated_spec!: You have already activated rack 1.6.8, but your Gemfile requires rack 2.0.5. Prepending bundle exec to your command may solve this. (Gem::LoadError)

Is there a way to use our own version of puma?

AWS Elastic Beanstalk	"Re: Rails: How to get puma 3.11 for AWS Elasticbeanstalk application?
Almost a year later, and no update to this question?  I'm having a similar issue as the original poster, I'm switching the build environment from macOS to Ubuntu, and now the 2.16 Puma gem won't build - native extension is failing. It looks like the problem is a dependency on an earlier OpenSSL version, but this raises another question, namely how many old security vulnerabilities are lurking here due to the failure to update to the latest version of Puma?

Is there some technical reason why Puma and Passenger aren't being updated in the Elastic Beanstalk images. Why bother updating the Ruby version if you aren't going to update the gems?

AWS Elastic Beanstalk	"Exceptionally long SDK calls to IoT and Kinesis in EB Node.js Application
Hi there,

One of our main projects is an Elastic Beanstalk (single instance) server running Node.js 8 which regularly (4 times per second):

Polls kinesis
Performs application logic to determine response
Posts response to MQTT via the IoT SDK


We have noticed that, occasionally, the SDk calls to IoT and/or Kinesis take an unbelievable amount of time (up to 7000ms compared to the standard ~20ms). This problem is most important for Kinesis as that is the entry point to the logic so this delayed call blocks the entire cycle.

Even more strangely, Kinesis reports through Cloudwatch/its own monitoring do not show these delays in any way.

Has anybody else experienced something similar? 
Is there a way to ""kill"" the SDK call after 1000ms if the call is taking too long?

Many thanks,

Hi yevsht ,

If you are indeed sure that the environment exists, this might be a credentials problem. Can you rerun as follows?

eb use APPServer-env -v  --region us-east-2 --debug --debugboto


In the logs, you should find a reference to your actual access ID. Can you verify that the correct profile is being used? Specifically, you look for the substring ""Credential="" in the logs, whose value will be the access ID.

Also, is it not feasible for you to store the credentials in a ~/.aws/credentials file?

Thanks,

Looks like the problem was that I'd put https: in the alias records and it had gotten munged into some weird encoding with a lot of backslashes. Could have sworn I tried both with and without that, but anyway removing it seems to have fixed things. 

I'd still appreciate any pointers to troubleshooting materials."
AWS Elastic Beanstalk	"HTTPS for NodeJS and Angular 6
Hello,
I am trying to access nodejs API with https from angular. I have done ELB settings for my instance and angular code is running with https, but I am not able to connect to nodejs API calls with https. 

How do I use code,
http.createServer or https.createServer in my nodejs code?

Because https.createServer requires a certificate to be read from the file system and I would like to use ACM to create the certificate."
AWS Elastic Beanstalk	"Could not connect to the endpoint URL error when running eb use command
Hi,

I am trying to deploy my app (from GitLab) to Elastic Beanstalk,  environment with docker platform was created.

running this command:
eb use  APPServer-env -v  --region us-east-2 --debug

getting error:
INFO: EndpointConnectionError - Could not connect to the endpoint URL: ""https://elasticbeanstalk.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/""

Note:
I didn't run eb init  (should I? if yes with what options?)

I believe it might be related to a proxy, in that case, how can I set up proxy for 'eb'?
