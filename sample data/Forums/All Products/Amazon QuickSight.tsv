Amazon QuickSight	"Quicksight incorrectly reading longitude data point for geospatial visualza
Hello,

I am performing an analysis on Quicksight from data and am trying to create a geospatial map from longitude an latitude data metrics. The only problem is that Quicksight is reading the longitude metric as a measurement as opposed to a geospatial dimension. Quicksight is correctly reading latitude and both have been created as floating data types within the DDL.
When trying to convert the longitude as a to a dimension it also does not convert it to the proper dimension type.is there a way to specify the type of dimension I would like longitude to be converted to (Date for example).

Has anyone else has similar issues or a possible solution to this issue?

Thank you

Amazon QuickSight	"Are there details of support for ServiceNow
Are there any official details on support for Servicenow as a data source?

It seems like currently on 'Problems' are supported.

I only see a few fields in the Problems table.  Can you access all the fields?

Amazon QuickSight	"Cannot use ""ifelse"" for QuickSight Tabular Report
I have a Tabular Report which has two data columns with decimal values and one dimension which I have set in the Group By box.

I also have one calculated field which looks like this
Field Name: ShareOfIsTopValue
Formula:
countIf(RespondentID,IsTopValue = ""YES"") / (countIf(RespondentID,IsTopValue = ""NO"") + countIf(RespondentID,IsTopValue = ""YES""))

All good so far, the list is displayed with both the decimal values and the calculated field.
However, I want to use IFELSE to display a text in a separate column based on the values in other fields, and that is not working.

Field Name: Result
Formula:
ifelse({ShareOfIsTopValue}>0.4,""Good"",""Bad"")

I get this error message: One of the functions used in the calculated field expression is not supported. Correct the expression and choose Create again.

Any tips are welcome!"
Amazon QuickSight	"Dashboards on shared multi tenant database
We want to create quick sight dashboards on our multi-tenant database. We are using shared tables with additional columns to identify each tenant. I have the following questions:
1. How would I restrict users of tenant A to see visualizations only based on tenant A's data? At which place these filters will be applied? Data modelling or data visualization? 
2. Is there a way to create tenant level dashboards and global level (accessible by all the tenants)?"

Amazon QuickSight	"Quicksight Usage
Hi,
We have a use case for Quicksight in which we would like to share the dashboard with clients to view analytics. However, we wouldnt want the clients to be able to filter the data or view data sets etc. Are there plans to implement something of this nature? Such as maybe a new permission setting for users. If so what sort of timescale would we be looking at?
thanks,

Amazon QuickSight	"difference between connecting quicksight to Mysql or Athena to query table
Hi Everyone,

I would like what are the main differences between using QuickSight to query directly a MySQL table or use Athena to query a CSV file on S3 of that same MySQL table that as been exported into S3.

Consider that the table is not that bigh... less than 200 lines.

Can someone let me know what are the main differences, like cost, performance, up to date, etc...

Thanks a lot, 
Sérgio"
Amazon QuickSight	"Re: difference between connecting quicksight to Mysql or Athena to query table
you donot need to pay if you are not using (pay as you go model) in Athena. you have to pay whether you use or not in Mysql."
Amazon QuickSight	"Re: difference between connecting quicksight to Mysql or Athena to query table
Athena supports Parquet format if you want best performance and less cost. 
Convert CSV to parquet .

Amazon QuickSight	"Re: difference between connecting quicksight to Mysql or Athena to query table
Hi Shivan,

thanks for your reply, but I did not get it. 
How am I paying if I use mysql dataset? 

If on both cases, the table will be stored in memory (SPICE) what would matter, if the data source is Athena or the RDS MySQL database?

I'm probably missing something, thanks for clarifying.

Regards,
Sérgio"
Amazon QuickSight	"Re: difference between connecting quicksight to Mysql or Athena to query table
1. if you are not using quick sight, you need to pay for MYSQL . is not it ?
but , you do not need to pay for Athena if you are not using it.
2. I think spice is optional, you can choose query if you want to load the data everytime from Athena.(not sure)"

Amazon QuickSight	"QuickSight Loop
Hello,

I am attempting to sign up to QuickSight but it is incredibly difficult. When I go to the QuickSight page, I get

""Your AWS Account is not signed up for QuickSight. Would you like to sign up now?""

I click ""Sign Up"", with my root account. 

Then, QuickSight says

""Resource permissions weren't updated. Edit your AWS resource permissions by following the instructions shown in Managing Amazon QuickSight Permissions to AWS Resources.""

This is my root account however, so I don't understand why I need more permissions. In any event, the dashboard in ""Managing Amazon QuickSight Permissions to AWS Resources"" is inaccessible because I'm not signed into QuickSight, and I'm currently in my root account.

So, the only option is to press ""Go To Amazon QuickSight""

After clicking that, it loops me back to the first page.

Amazon QuickSight	"How to restrict access to S3 buckets by Author in QuickSight?
Context
The company is using QuickSight to create Dashboards. There are different departments using it. One department can not access data from another department. Dashboards are created based on Athena Datasets. Athena tables are based on S3 buckets. Each department has its own Dashboards, based on each own tables or views. Each department has named one user to create Analysis and Dashboards. Each user has a QuickSight account as Author.

Requirement
As QuickSight (or AWS) Admin, I should be able to define which S3 buckets (or Athena tables) each Author has access to, restricting access to data when the Authors manage Datasets.

Current Scenario
Once S3 buckets are configured to be used in QuickSights ALL authors have access to ALL S3 buckets.

What are my options?

Thanks."
Amazon QuickSight	"How to define once QuickSight Analysis Visuals and point to diff sources
Background: I am having two different versions of my platform writing to two separate AWS S3 buckets. I have AWS Athena working over these two buckets and creating two separate tables. I want to define once all of the QuickSight Visuals and to be able to apply them over different data sources (the different Athena tables).

I couldn't find a way to define the visual once and then replicate the Analysis pointing to different data sources.

Attempt at a solution: (i.e. point to a different data source)

I tried editing (i.e. changing) the data source in QuickSight that the analysis's dataset is based on, and then refreshing the dataset, in hopes that the analysis would reflect the new data source. However, after refreshing, the dataset still contained only the data from the original data source.
