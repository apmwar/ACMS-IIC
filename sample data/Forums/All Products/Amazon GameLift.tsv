Amazon GameLift	"Anyway to speed up Fleet Activation?
Typically when spinning up a new fleet in gamelift, it takes about 15 minutes before it becomes ""ACTIVE"". Seems to sit on ""NEW"" for about 1 minute, then ""DOWNLOADING"" for about 3 minutes (even though the zip is only 1MB) then ""VALIDATING"" for 2 minutes, then ""ACTIVATING"" for about 9 minutes... Is there anyway to speed that up? Less concurrent processes maybe (I'm using 20 at the moment) or higher max concurrent game session activations? (I'm doing 5 at the moment)."
Amazon GameLift	"Mono C# GameLift server on Amazon Linux instances?
Would rather not deploy to windows instances if I can help it. Have a game server that is written in C# and works well with Mono on linux, but the command line for invoking it is ""mono GameService.exe"", which doesn't work with how gamelift enforces ""/local/game/"" as the prefix. Is there a way to get this working?"
Amazon GameLift	"Re: Mono C# GameLift server on Amazon Linux instances?
I was able to get this working by installing the mono-complete rpm in an install script, creating a symlink to mono in the /usr/local/game folder, and then calling mono as the launch path and the exe as the argument. works great!"

Amazon GameLift	"FlexMatch Matchmaking times out
Hey there, I am using GameLift with Unreal, and I set up the FlexMatch system exactly as it is described in the docs. â€‹

I have a queue on eu-central-1, which has a fleet linked to running at us-west-2. To that, I got a matchmaker ruleset and configuration on eu-central-1. The configuration uses the queue.

I integrated everything in my client and server, but if I start my matchmaking, it's at SEARCHING for 60 seconds (my matchmaking timeout I defined in the configuration), and then returns TIMED_OUT, even though the fleet has one instance up. I also tried to create a new session through the queue using start-game-session-placement from the AWS CLI. That did create a new session successfully on my server too, but the matchmaking won't simply find that.

Help is greatly appreciated"

Amazon GameLift	"Issue: GameLiftLocal returns incomplete data for DescribeGameSessions

Amazon GameLift	"How to teminate ""Activating"" fleets
Hi! Can you terminate a fleet in ""activating"" state? I've tried almost everything with AWS CLI. Delete-fleet it does not work because ""from ACTIVATING to DELETING is not a valid transition"", changed the capacity to 0 but I still have a instance on ""PENDING"" and even tho I removed the build, the fleet keeps sending ""Server started correctly but did not call InitSDK() in the GameLift Server SDK within 5 minutes"" events.

I guess I could just launch another fleet with the new build but I guess that new fleet is ""out"" of the free tier.

Thanks in advance!"
Amazon GameLift	"Re: How to teminate ""Activating"" fleets
Sorry, at this time you can't delete a fleet which is still activating, you will need to wait until the fleet transitions to ACTIVE or FAILED before you can delete it.

As far as exceeding the free tier by having parallel instances running, the free tier is actually calculated by the total number of hours of the free tier instance type used.  That is currently 125 free hours of the c3.large.gamelift instance type.  It doesn't matter if you run one of those instances for 125 hours, or 125 for 1 hour.  If you don't exceed the total hours, you should still stay within the free tier.

Amazon GameLift	"Steam + Amazon GameLift Integration
Hello, 

We're currently developing a game where:

the game is in Unreal Engine 4.17
the game uses the Steam online subsystem
we want to use GameLift to manage player sessions, games and matchmaking


We would like to ask, what is the actual (step-by-step) flow for integrating GameLift with a Steam online subsystem?

We see that Disc Jam has achieved this goal: http://steamcommunity.com/games/415880/announcements/detail/2906362192348502566

Basically, we want to do the same with our game.

Also, an additional question:

After the game client sends a requests to GameLift such as lobby creation, player session creation or joining, is there anyway to communicate additional info back to the client once it responds?

I use a language and game engine not supported by Amazon which means that I've had to roll my own code for all of the requests.

Amazon GameLift	"FlexMatch match acceptance doesn't work
Hello!
We are very excited about new GameLift service named FlexMatch and we are evaluating it now doing some experiments with aws cli (version 1.11.142).
First problem I've got is strange behavior of matchmaking with enabled player acceptance.
I'm using simple ruleset for testing purposes:
{
    ""name"": ""simple-ruleset"",
    ""ruleLanguageVersion"": ""1.0"",
    ""playerAttributes"": [{
        ""name"": ""rating"",
        ""type"": ""number""
    }],
    ""teams"": [{
        ""name"": ""gang"",
        ""maxPlayers"": 1,
        ""minPlayers"": 1
    },{
        ""name"": ""swat"",
        ""maxPlayers"": 1,
        ""minPlayers"": 1
    }],
    ""rules"": [],
    ""expansions"": []
}

Matchmaking configuration has 60 seconds timeout for matchmaking and 20 seconds timeout for acceptance.
Also I've set notifications using SNS topic.
Then I make two start-matchmaking calls using aws cli, by describe-matchmaking and message from SNS I see that these tickets have changed status to ""REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE"".
So everything was fine until now. But now neither accept-match requests or acceptance timeout don't change the status of these tickets. So these tickets just hang forever.
That's the list of notifications I've got by SNS during this experiment:

My real question is, my data is purely just content--all sensitive stuff like player progress. Financial stuff, etc, I am planning on using Playfab back end services. So, if I put all my DLC on S3 and just had my game download it through simple URL downloads, is the s3 server going to handle huge volumes of download.
