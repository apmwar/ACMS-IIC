Amazon Simple Email Service	"All verfied domains and emails have vanished from my account
At somepoint this morning all of the verified domains and emails vanished from my account resulting in my client not being able to send emails through our system.

I'd like to know how in hell something like this can happen??"
Amazon Simple Email Service	"How do I tell Amazon SES their IP addresses are blacklisted
Is there an official way to tell Amazon SES about blacklisting, and ask them to talk to the other company involved? 

I have had emails disappear this week and last week (Ironport doesn't even send proper bounces back to to my SNS endpoint) and discovered through https://mxtoolbox.com that Amazon's IP 54.240.3.26 is blacklisted by SORBS and Suomispam at the moment.

How do I inform Amazon of this? The documentation (below) doesn't mention the process.
Thank you.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/blacklists.html
We don't monitor blacklists that are unlikely to impact delivery across the entire Amazon SES service, or that don't have a measurable impact on delivery to major email providers. The blacklists offered by SORBS fall into this category. When one of our IP addresses appears on a blacklist in this category, we'll ask the provider to remove our IP addresses on a case-by-case basis."

Hello,

After checking your sending account in US-WEST-2, the email identity you mentioned is NOT verified.

You can double confirm this from SES Console too.

So it's possible you or somebody else removed the identity, we recommend to enable CloudTrail to trace all the API calls you will be able to track who deleted the identity.

Given the truth that I have been moved out of the sandbox, Do I still need to add those email addresses I am sending mail to(for example, the mail address I mentioned) as verified email addresses?

If so, what is the purpose of the sandbox? I think after I am out of the sandbox, I can send emails to any address(even unverified, like the address I mentioned) from my verified address(hanzhaogang@gamil.com, hanzhaogang@foxmail.com)

Amazon Simple Email Service	"Re: Amazon SES IPs Blacklisted by 0spam - nosolicitado - SORBS
Hi,

Thanks for contacting AWS! I understand you are having delivery issues and are finding SES IPs on blacklists. 

Specifically, I see that you are receiving the following error message: 

""Remote host said: 554 5.7.1 Spam detected by content scanner. Message rejected.""


Please note that this error is indicating that the content in your messages are triggering a spam filter and are being bounced for this reason. When you are effected by an email blacklist you will see bounce messages similar to the following:

""554 5.7.1 Service unavailable; Client host [192.0.2.0] blocked using blacklistName; See: http://www.example.com/query/ip/192.0.2.0""


It's important to note that different blacklists have different impacts on the successful delivery of a message. Major email providers—including Gmail, Hotmail, AOL, and Yahoo—seem to recognize a very small number of highly regarded blacklists, such as those offered by Spamhaus. In our experience, other blacklists tend to have a low impact, although some mail systems emphasize certain blacklists over others. 

If you can provide evidence of messages that you are sending being returned due to blacklisting, please private message me this example and associated SES message ID for me to assist further.

Additionally, we have a great blacklist FAQ that answer many common questions regarding this:

We are using https://beefree.io/bee-plugin/ as an editor for generating the HTML for our emails.

This HTML gets handed over to SES. After SES has delivered the email to a recipient's inbox it looks like this:

So only the href within the <a>
 gets tracked, but the href within <v:roundrect>
 remains untracked.

Amazon Simple Email Service	"Email Forwards Fail because of Duplicate DKIM-Signature Header
Dear Support,

We're currently transitioning our email delivery from network nodes to using the SES service. We have successfully migrated our office email to use the service as well as our application servers. As a result we have seen better success in delivery to our customers as the AWS infrastructure has better email delivery reputation than random IP addresses on the Internet.

However, when reporting an error message from our application server, an email is sent out through the SES service to our internal mail server. The mail server then expands the email alias and delivers the message locally as well as to external email addresses which bounces.

Attached is a copy of the email source from the bounced message, in there are two error messages.


reason: 501 Invalid MAIL FROM address provided
reason: 554 Transaction failed: Duplicate header 'DKIM-Signature'.


The first, Invalid MAIL FROM, I believe is a misnomer as emailing directly from our internal mail server works, and I have verified the email address/domain. I believe that the actual errors is because of the Duplicate DKIM header.

We're using sendmail internally to deliver mail, and was thinking that adding a milter to remove the DKIM header when sending messages out would be the best solution. Am I on the right track, or is there something else that would be a better fix?

Hi,

I have recently requested a Sending Limit Increase for my SES account; case ID: 5765510991.

This is what I had written in my 2nd request:

""Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to explain.

Well, as I mentioned in my request, I am a blogger (new one actually), so my main use of Amazon SES will be to send notifications to my readers to update them about the new posts that I have published on my blog.

Apart from that, there will be occasional informational emails on the topic of my blog and a few promotional emails.

I am also planning a 7 days series of emails, so that would be set as an autoresponder. So, when someone signs up for this series they will receive the emails for 7 days, one after one in 5 to 24 hours interval.

I have been using GetResponse for my email marketing. But the renewal cost of the tool is very high compared to my uses. So, I was just looking for a cheaper alternative and came across Sendy, and that's how I learned about Amazon SES.

Since I am looking to cut down on some of my expenses, I am pretty much looking forward to using Sendy with Amazon SES.

As of now, I have a list of almost 1600 subscribers, and all of them are genuine and collected through my blog and social media, and with the user's consent.

So, I will be sending a max of 8 to 10 emails per subscriber per month, apart from the welcome email or the 7 days email series.

Each email I sent out includes an unsubscribe link for the users, so, at any moment if any of my subscribers decide to unsubscribe they can do that easily.

The email tool Sendy will take care of the bounce, and for the complaints, I will personally interact with the users, or they can anytime unsubscribe.

My notification emails are usually an intro of the blog post and the link to read the full post.

My promotional emails are usually related to special sales on hosting plans, domain names or digital marketing tools; for example, BlackFriday deals. And also I don't promote stuff that I haven't used personally.

My other occasional emails are a small writeup on topics that are not too vast to post as a blog post or to share anything new that I have experienced (personal or professional), or sometimes just to say ""Hi"".

I don't know if I have made myself clear enough or not. But I hope I did.

If you need any more information please let me know. If anything technical you need to know, do let me that as well. I don't know if I would understand, but I will try to clear everything I can.""

*bold*New information: I have confirmed Sendy will take care of the bounce as well as complaints.

So, my sincere request to you please reconsider my case. I don't think I can be any more open than this. Still, if you need any more specific details please let me know; don't just cut me off like that.

I am sorry if this is not the right place to post this request. I don't know how else can I reach you.

Looking forward to a positive response.

Amazon Simple Email Service	"Re: Email verification
Hi arpi,

When you create a TXT record in GoDaddy's console, it automatically appends your domain name to the name that you entered in the Host field. So, if you add a TXT record with a Host value of _amazonses.example.com, GoDaddy converts it (without telling you) to _amazonses.example.com.example.com.

If you edit the DNS record so that the value in the Host field is just ""_amazonses"" (without the quotes), you should be good to go.

Amazon Simple Email Service	"Duplicate emails
Hi!

I've seen several posts on this topic but a good answer yet.

We sometimes see that the emails we send using SES are delivered as two emails to the receivers.
We are using Spring's JavaMailSender (spring boot 1.3.3) and in the logs (logging before and after the call to the javaMailSender.send method) there is clearly just one call for each mail that is received twice.

Example of message ids:
Message-ID: <01020168ebbc201b-d9fcdcb0-c466-4047-ae36-27fc61d30710-000000@eu-west-1.amazonses.com>

Any ideas on what might cause this?"
Amazon Simple Email Service	"Re: Duplicate emails
Hi,

Each unique message ID represents a separate request sent to SES. It seems those two messages your provided were sent at the same time, to the same recipient. Is that the problem you are concerned about? If so, I would look at your application to make sure it's not making repeat calls to SES for certain cases.

Amazon Simple Email Service	"Re: SendBulkTemplatedEmail not working?
Hi,

I'm sorry you're having troubles with this API. What SDK are you using to call SES?

If you are using the AWS CLI, I find it easier to generate an example request JSON using the '--generate-cli-skeleton' flag and then pass the request into the CLI command with the '--cli-input-json' parameter. 

Example:
aws ses send-bulk-templated-email --generate-cli-skeleton

Amazon Simple Email Service	"Help Getting Out Of The Sandbox
We have a rather new website (2-3 months old) - ecommerce, selling fashion items. We started with gathering subscribers with mailchimp - but their pricing structure is based on the number of contact you have and not on the number of emails you send (we only send once per month). We reached a few thousands subscribers and decided to switch to another email service provider, as mailchimp was a bit too expensive for our sending needs. So we looked for another alternative. Found amazon ses which seemed to be cheap (compared to most others) and very reliable (it's amazon, duh). We then investigated and saw that sending via amazon ses is not that easy - as it has no interface / dashboard - and you need a software to ""plug"" ses into it and send your emails. We found 2 alternatives : interspire email marketer and sendy (sendy.com). We chose sendy as it was cheaper.

Set up sendy on our host, configured everything, last step was to configure it's amazon ses settings. So we signed up for an aws account, verified the phone number, verified our credit card and in 24 hrs got access to ses and the other aws services.

Verified our sending domain inside ses (and added the dkim keys), verified 2 email addresses (personal one and one hosted at the domain) and then we tried to send a few test emails. Then we found out that, just like all new accounts our account was in sandbox mode and we could only send emails to the addresses we verified in our account.

So we then requested to raise our limits and get out of the sandbox. Here's the request i sent :

+""We'll be using ses to send emails to our subscribers - which we have gathered via our online store and newsletter signup forms (using double opt in). The emails we're sending to are all valid (just re-verified the whole list 3 days ago after exporting it from mailchimp - all complaints and bounces - both hard and soft - were removed). We have been using another email service provide for a long time now - mailchimp - but we're planning to move to SES because mailchimp was a bit expensive (their pricing structure was based on the number of subscribers, and not on the number of emails sent - we have a few thousands subscribers but we send emails to them only once a month - or once every 2 months - so paying just to have a bigger list was not right).

We will be using sendy (sendy.com) to send the emails - sendy will handle bounces, complaints and unsubscribe requests effectively. We have already configured sendy to interact with ses in order to handle the bounces, complaints and subscribes.

I have also verified our domain (and added the dkim keys) in the ses management console, and also verified 2 email addresses (my personal one and a business one hosted at our domain). Our domain is clean, it's not present on any blacklists, none of our email addresses are on any blacklist - the content of the emails we're sending is relevant to our subscribers (product updates and promotions).""+

I requested 10k emails per day (although we'll probably send less than that per month), i selected that our emails comply with TOS and AUP, that we send to recipients who have requested our mails and that we have a process to handle bounces and complaints (sendy). For mail type, i selected subscription.

24 hrs later, i was surprised by the reply i got :
""We regret to inform you that we cannot grant your request for increased Amazon SES sending limits in AWS Region US East (N. Virginia) at this time. We have determined that your use of Amazon SES may adversely impact our services. For further information about our policies, please review our Acceptable Use Policy and Service Terms.""

I mean, from what people were saying on the sendy forums, everyone got accepted into SES - so i don't know what the problem is. To me, this vague response looks like an auto-generated message. Is there anyone who can help us get out of the sandbox? Is there anything specific we should do? Or is amazon denying all new clients? Should we try and fix this, make it work somehow or are we doing something completely wrong and amazon ses is definitely not for us and we should give up on it?"

We're having the same issue. We have been using SES under our own AWS account for YEARS and never had any problems.

We recently launched a new project (a startup) and wanted to keep it separate from our existing business, so we setup a separate AWS account for it. 

But now Amazon are refusing to take SES out of Sandbox and increase the sending limit - even though what I am asking for is the exact same thing we have asked for in the past and always been approved...

i.e. 

sending limit = relatively small 10K per day sending limit (which is higher than we need right now, but just in case).
use case = account notification emails (signup, forgot password, new message, etc).


We've asked 3 times in 3 different ways (thinking it might have just been the support person assigned not knowing what they were doing) but each time its the same rejection message about denying our Amazon SES sending limit increase request in AWS Region  US West (Oregon).

Amazon Simple Email Service	"Bounce Issue with from/MAIL FROM
Hi,

We're are using SES for some time now and are running into some problems with a German E-Mail-Provider. All E-Mails sent with SES bounce with code ""550 No valid sender in header"". We digged into this and it seems like they are having an issue with differences in the “from” and “MAIL FROM”.

All our domains and email addresses in use have been verified and are ready for sending. But when we verify an address like “user@example.de”. and want so set a MAIL FROM, we are required to choose a subdomain, let's say “welcome.example.de”. 

Now, when we send with mails from “user@example.com”, we have “example.de” as “from” and “welcome.example.de” as MAIL FROM. This difference seems to cause the bounces.

I tried to verify an email address with a subdomain such as “welcome.example.de” but then we are required to add another subdomain for the “MAIL FROM” which would result in sth. like “mail.welcome.example.de”. Again, we would run into the ""no valid sender in header"" issue.

Am I making a mistake in setting up the “MAIL FROMs” for email addresses and domains or is it just not possible to have “from” and “MAIL FROM” to be the same?

I would appreciate any suggestions on what to change in our processes and settings.

Thanks,

Amazon Simple Email Service	"Re: Bounce Issue with from/MAIL FROM
Hi Christof,

I'm sorry to hear about your difficulties with this ISP. I have not heard of ISPs requiring a match between from header and MAIL FROM unless you have enabled DMARC authentication on your domain in 'strict' mode. 

Regardless, you should be able to use a From header address at your custom MAIL FROM domain as long as the parent domain is verified. 

For example:
Verified domain: example.com
Custom Mail From:  cmf.example.com
SES SendEmail request with from parameter set to: ""test@cmf.example.com""

The subdomain ""cmf.example.com"" does not need to be explicitly verified since you can send from any subdomain of an already verified domain.

Hope this helps. For more info you can see the following two links:

Amazon Simple Email Service	"Re: Must I verify all my emails destination?
Hi monchyrcg,

It looks like your account is still in the sandbox. When your account is in the sandbox, you can only send email to verified addresses. For information about having your account removed from the sandbox, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/request-production-access.html.

In the meantime, if you want to perform tests, you can send emails to the addresses associated with the Amazon SES email simulator. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/mailbox-simulator.html.

I hope this helps. Thank you for using Amazon SES!

Hi friend,
We were using sendgrid and just started with AWS SES, and we were purchased sendy and their installation service.

1. we submited a request, some simple situation wrote, but I ask for 30K per months as we have 200K subscriber. 

2. this request got denied in 24 hours and no reason to give, I thought our situation was not detail enough, so I wrote our company name and address, give the screen shot of our ERP where subscribers are. And a short describe of our email campaign as we are child and baby related e commerce site. But still got denied.

3. I searched and look for people in my situation, and ask for help, I followed a form to write the detail info, add how we will handle complain and unsubscribe. ask for 15K/Month and 20/Sec rate.
But still a no with no reason. 

4. I just don't know what can I do now, 
give up this account? change another domain? purchase sendy.co again? 

I am just doing my job, and this is the goal should be done before shopping season.
Hope you can kindly tell me what's wrong and let me fix it, or you can simply tell me don't send time on this.

Just noticed that SES isn't escaping template data when rendering the HTML template for a message. This means if you're including user inputted data (eg from a contact form) we need to escape it ourselves and potentially provide alternate data for the html template vs the text template.

The SES docs imply that http://handlebarsjs.com/ is used to render the template (refers to it here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/send-personalized-email-advanced.html) but the handlebars docs say that {{variable}}

*****************
We detected that the CNAME records required for the DKIM setup of performantlabs.com are no longer present in your DNS settings.

To protect your email deliverability, we have temporarily disabled DKIM signing for emails originating from performantlabs.com. If you use Amazon Pinpoint to send mail through this domain, those emails will also be affected.

If the removal of the CNAME records was intentional, you do not need to take any additional action. In 5 days, performantlabs.com will no longer be considered to be configured for the purpose of DKIM signing.

If it was unintentional, please restore the CNAME records to your DNS settings within 5 days. Once we confirm the presence of the CNAME records, we will re-enable DKIM signing.

Please note that the settings for individually verified email addresses override domain-level settings. For example, if you enable DKIM signing for a verified domain but disable DKIM signing for a verified email address in that domain, then emails from that email address will not be DKIM-signed.

For DKIM troubleshooting information, see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/DKIM-problems.html .

Amazon Simple Email Service	"Re: troubleshooting between SES and  Orange.fr/Wanadoo.fr
Hi AWS !

Same problem for me :

Many of my customers use an e-mail @orange.fr or @wanadoo.fr and no longer receive e-mails from our service that are sent via AWS SES.

What do we have to do ?"
Amazon Simple Email Service	"Re: troubleshooting between SES and  Orange.fr/Wanadoo.fr
Hi all, AWS,
I got a response from Orange - Abuse service.
They said that they are waiting for AWS response ... 
I love ping-pong but with a racket ...


""Bonjour
Votre addrese IP est hébérgé chez amzones. Elle a été bloquée suite à une 
attaque de spam et nous sommes depuis dans l'attente d'un retour 
d'Amazones pour solutionner cet incident.
Cordialement

Amazon Simple Email Service	"Re: troubleshooting between SES and  Orange.fr/Wanadoo.fr
Hi all,

It's the same for me.

The service abuse Orange answered me after a test of deliverability :

""Hello,

The IP address of emission is hosted at Amazon SES. It was blocked following an attack of spam and we are now waiting for a return of Amazons to solve this incident.

Abuse Orange Internet Service""

AWS can try to solve the problem please ?
It's been several days ... and I lose customers every day

Thanks !"

Exact same problem here. All our emails to @orange.fr as well as @wanadoo.fr are being blocked (not delivered to recipient) with following error or similar:

smtp; 550 mwinf5c69 ME Service refuse. Veuillez essayer plus tard. Service refused, please try later. OFR006_103 54.240.3.11


This is very problematic to us. Please AWS, do something!"

+1. This is an extremely serious issue as Orange is the largest ISP in France. I have also contacted abuse@orange.fr who said that AWS needs to contact them. And as an AWS Customer I believe that this should be a top priority for you. All our messages are getting rejected."
Amazon Simple Email Service	"Re: troubleshooting between SES and  Orange.fr/Wanadoo.fr
The problem is still going on. IS THERE SOMEONE AT AWS ON THE CASE ?"
Amazon Simple Email Service	"Re: troubleshooting between SES and  Orange.fr/Wanadoo.fr
Hello,

We are aware of the issues that SES customers are having delivering mail to Orange, and we are working with Orange to resolve the problem.

Thank you for your patience, and for using Amazon SES.

We've now resolved this issue with cooperation from Orange's deliverability and support team.

We apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience as we worked through this issue. Thank you for using Amazon SES."
Amazon Simple Email Service	"Re: troubleshooting between SES and  Orange.fr/Wanadoo.fr
Ok thanks, I will test it ASAP.

To avoid this problem, i had to use an alternative SMTP server specialy for orange.fr & wanadoo.fr domains."
Amazon Simple Email Service	"Re: troubleshooting between SES and  Orange.fr/Wanadoo.fr
Hi,

We now have the same problem since the January 24th 2019. We cannot reach the orange.fr and wanadoo.fr email addresses. Could you please investigate this problem ?"
Amazon Simple Email Service	"Re: troubleshooting between SES and  Orange.fr/Wanadoo.fr
We are experimenting problems to deliver emails to orange.fr and wanadoo.fr. The problem is repeated over and over again. please fix it."
Amazon Simple Email Service	"Email Feedback Forwarding From Address
When Amazon forwards a feedback loop email when Email Feedback Forwarding is enabled, what will be the amazon From email?

Knowing this will allow me to create a filter for that as headers are not filterable in Gmail."
Amazon Simple Email Service	"Re: Email Feedback Forwarding From Address
Hi velvetpixeldevcam,

Please take a look at ""Email Feedback Forwarding Destination"" section in link below,
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/notifications-via-email.html#notifications-via-email-destination

Thank you for using AWS Simple Email Service,
Kenil B."
Amazon Simple Email Service	"Re: Email Feedback Forwarding From Address
Hi Kenil,

Thank you for the link.
It seems to only clarify the destination To: for forwards.

I am looking for the From: address as it is written by Amazon during the forward.
I am guessing it has ses and amazon as part of the address but would like confirmation."
