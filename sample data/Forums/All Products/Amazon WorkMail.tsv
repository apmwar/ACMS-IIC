Amazon WorkMail	"Archiving email
We note that AWS has a storage limit which we are well inside at the moment but in due course we may wish to archive older messages on local storage here.

What is the best way to do this?"
Amazon WorkMail	"Re: Archiving email
No one?  We were wondering if we could use IMAP in Thunderbird and then copy the folders down to local folders"
Amazon WorkMail	"Re: Archiving email
Hi,

It seems that nobody who reads the WorkMail forums has had the same problem as you want to solve. But using Thunderbird and IMAP with local folders should definitely be a good solution. Similarly Windows Outlook and a PST file should do the trick as well. 

Another solution that you can use is email journaling: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workmail/latest/adminguide/journaling_overview.html.

Kind regards,
Robin"
Amazon WorkMail	"Re: Archiving email
The original question mentioned storage limits so I think it's as much a storage management question as a backup question.

Journaling can solve the backup problem, but it doesn't address the storage a management problem.  I really don't want to accumulate gigs and gigs of spam, or mailing list messages.  My previous solution provided retention rules by folder that helped to manage those things.   Right now in WorkMail if I want to find and delete everything in a folder more than a year old that would have to be done on the client side which is not at all optimal."
Amazon WorkMail	"Re: Archiving email
Hi,

I've checked with the service team and the feature to set retention policies is on the roadmap.

Amazon WorkMail	"2FA Support
Hi, 
Are there any plans to add 2FA to Workmail on the Public Roadmap?

Thank you for your question regarding 2FA authentication for WorkMail. I checked with the service team if this is on their roadmap and this feature request is indeed on their roadmap but the team cannot disclose any dates for this.

Amazon WorkMail	"Missing emails upon moving to subfolder
Hi,
I've recently had an issue where Mac Mail has somehow permanently deleted local and server copies of some emails upon trying to move them from the inbox to a subfolder. The emails were deleted from the inbox, but did not get moved to the destination folder. The emails don't show in the ""Restore items"" menu either.
Is there any form of backup available of these and if so are these in any way available to accounts on the basic support plan?

Amazon WorkMail	"Taking too long to receive NDRs
Our users are frustrated that it takes several hours to a day to receive an NDR. They need to make sure their responses go through before the end of the day.

It's some sort of internal unpublished limit. Maybe if enough people post about the problem here, AWS will eventually address it - my impression is that they don't think it's a problem many people have. Not being able to send out more than 6 emails at a time is an unfortunate limitation.

I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing problems with your domain verification.

Alternatively you can add all records with your domain registrar.

Amazon WorkMail	"Workmail already taken 24 hours, no DNS verification for external domain.
I setup the TXT and CNAME records for the external domain I want to use for email yesterday as indicated on the AWS Workmail setup, but as of this morning (Tuesday, February 12, 2019), Workmail still has that domain as not verified.

It says at the bottom of the Workmail screen that DNS can take up to 72 hours, but in my experience, it's usually much shorter than that (a few minutes to maybe 20 minutes).

One possible issue is that the CNAME value is something like ""10 other-characters-here"". If I copied the whole string with the 10 and the space, I would get an error. I'm assuming the 10 is the TTL or something, but this might be the issue.  Once I just saved the part after the 10 and the space, it saved OK, but not verifying.

Amazon WorkMail	"Re: Workmail already taken 24 hours, no DNS verification for external domain.
Hi,

I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing problems with the domain verification of your WorkMail organization. I checked your organization and I think the problem is in the created domains. It seems the records are created with domain.com.domain.com. 

Some registrars automatically append the domain to the record you create and a straight copy of the domain record from the WorkMail console then leads to a double domain record. Can you verify your domain records to ensure the domain is not twice in the record? If that is corrected the verification should happen. You can force a retry of the domain verification in the SES console in the domain section.

For the domain record with ""10 domain.com"", this is a MX record and the 10 is for priority of that SMTP server.

Amazon WorkMail	"Domain Verification FAILURE in region for Workmail following Lightsail
I registered a domain name in Route 53 (confchem-r.com) and set up Workmail successfully.

This seemed to work, but I must have made a mistake because it broke Workmail; I think I initially tried to set up the server in a different territory from the registered domain, or maybe the Name Servers from Lightsail conflicted with the original ones.  I have now killed the Lightsail instance completely and attempted to set up Workmail from fresh, following the instructions here  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-workmail.html, and the original settings (as far as I can tell), but it isn't working.

Amazon WorkMail	"Re: Domain Verification FAILURE in region for Workmail following Lightsail
Hi,

I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing problems with your domain verification. I took a look at your domain and was unable to resolve any record. It seems that your name servers are incorrectly configured. Please update your domains name servers at your domain registrar to the correct values from the route 53 hosted zone. After that you can re-trigger the verification process in the Amazon SES console in the domain section.

If you still want to use Lightsail you can but you will need to manage your WorkMail domain records in the Lightsail console and not in a hosted zone. Once you add a domain in Lightsail you will need to manage all your domain records from it.

Amazon WorkMail	"A user can see/use my inbox without permission
One of my colleagues has since yesterday access to my inbox despite having no permission for.
When he opens Outlook my inbox appears listed below his own, and he can do any action (sending, receiving, deleting, ...).
This seems to happen only on his PC, not e.g. on his mobile phone.

1) My Inbox has default permissions and the only thing I share (specifically with this colleague) is my calendar.
2) No users has access permission to the inbox of the others.
3) I'm the most privileged user, but not on personal inboxes - I have permissions on group emails.

Amazon WorkMail	"Re: A user can see/use my inbox without permission
Hi Claudio,

The service team investigated your issue and it seems you have misinterpreted the way WorkMail permissions work. You have given multiple groups full mailbox access permissions on your user. This means that all members of these groups have full mailbox access to your user and explains why your colleague can open your mailbox without you giving explicit permissions to do so.

If you want to give your user permissions on groups you need to add your user to the group.

I will check with the service team to review the documentation and console details for this.

Robin"

Amazon WorkMail	"Migrate cPanel mail & etc folder data to WorkMail
As the subject states I'm interested in migrating existing mail and etc data over from a generic cPanel account into the WorkMail environment on AWS. Is it possible at all? Or do I have to archive the cPanel data and start fresh with WorkMail? 

My question is for a concerned client that needs email history for the sake of preventing litigation in their business - so it would be great to be able to assure no loss in emails. I have made the assumption that if they were to create a new mail account, pointing to WorkMail, they could possibly lose their local backups of messages. I have downloaded a zip of both the mail & the etc folders and I have access to their name servers, ready to point them to an AWS Route 53 created zone to begin the process of migration to WorkMail. 

Any advice from someone who has dealt with something similar or has a deeper knowledge on the subject would be greatly appreciated."
Amazon WorkMail	"Re: Migrate cPanel mail & etc folder data to WorkMail
Hi,

Welcome to WorkMail! To migrate to WorkMail there are some options available: If the old mail server supports EWS (Exchange WebServices) then our migration partners can help with the migration. If no EWS is available but you have Windows Outlook you can do the migration by exporting the mailboxes to a PST file which can be imported in the new WorkMail mailbox. Another solution is to drag and drop mail in any client that support multiple mail accounts. 

WorkMail does not offer an console side import where you can upload a zip file with mail data.

Your redirect rule has a redirect action for each recipient, which is failing due bug in the system. The service team will fix this asap.

A solution for you problem is to add all recipients in 1 redirect action. This will not trigger the bug and cause the message to be redirected to all recipients.

Amazon WorkMail	"Workmail SMTP Gateway and Outbound rules to flow mail to trendmicro HES
I see a lot of AWS response to the forums and have a case open (01633045) that is not getting to a resolution and am hoping this forum is monitored by someone with practical application knowledge on this.  Am happy with AWS and the support given but I think this hits an area not covered by their expertise.

I have to think it's normal (we do it with premise based exchange servers) to want to direct email out thru a cloud based scanning service (in this case we want DLP and email encrypt functions from Trendmicro HES outbound scanning).  

I have all pieces configured and working except the actual connection.  HES and AWS have verifications steps that are marked as good.  The domain's inbound is successfully flowing inbound via TM HES.   When I send an email that routes out to the SMTP gateway pointing to the standard outbound smart host (relay.hes.trendmicro.com) i get a bounce.  

Trendmicro support reviewed and has said it's not getting to the smarthost and the bounce is generated by AWS (it would be nice to have access to logs to self debug this).  Here's the bounce:

An error occurred while trying to deliver the mail to the following recipients:

start ndr
Technical report:

Reporting-MTA: dsn; a11-123.smtp-out.amazonses.com

Action: failed

Diagnostic-Code: smtp; 554 5.7.1 <xxx@aol.com>: Recipient address rejected: NO-DOMAIN.
Status: 5.7.1
end ndr

Am looking for anyone that has gotten this figured out or if there are other forums that may have a good answer for this.  I may be the first to try HES outbound with Workmail.  I don't know.  I have to think that someone has run into this with a cloud outbound scanning service (trendmicro or other).  There is plenty of info on how to configure Exchange server and other premise based servers for an outbound smarthost but AWS workmail doesn't conform to how they show to do this."

Amazon WorkMail	"Re: DNS records shown as missing even though they are there...
Hi,

I checked with the service team and tried to find out some more on how LightSail manages its domains and I think I figured out what is wrong with your configuration. 

If you want to use LightSail to manage your domain, you will need to add all records in LightSails DNS zone for that domain. Then for the domain record in route 53 (not the hosted zone) you will need to update the NS servers to the ones supplied in LightSail. If you manage all your domain records via LigthSail you no longer need the hosted zone that you currently have in route 53 as the DNS zone in LightSail does the same for you.

For the working of WorkMail when domain verification fails there is a grace period where you're still allowed to send mail but receiving will fail as the DNS records cannot be resolved by the other party. Logging on to the system is not linked to the DNS records and will always be allowed.

Amazon WorkMail	"Pointing a domain to Amazon work mail
We have a work domain and we want to point the email feed to Amazon work mail - is there a simple ""how-to"" in the help file somewhere as we may not be using the right words to bring it up"
Amazon WorkMail	"Re: Pointing a domain to Amazon work mail
Hi,

I took a look at the WorkMail documentation but indeed it lacks a detailed page describing how to manage mail via MX records. I will ask the team to look into this.

For your case, assuming you already have a WorkMail organization you can add your domain to the WorkMail organization. Once you have added the domain you will need to verify the ownership of the domain. This is done by creating a TXT domain record with the value that is shown in the WorkMail console. 

After the domain ownership is verified you can add the domain to all users email address. Then you can create or update the existing MX domain record to point to WorkMail, again the required value for this domain record is specified in the WorkMail console. 

Its strongly recommended to create all records suggested by the WorkMail console. The autodiscover record will allow automatic configuration for your mail clients and the DKIM, SPF and DMARC records will improve mail security and deliverability.

Kind regards,
Robin"
Amazon WorkMail	"Re: Pointing a domain to Amazon work mail
Good morning Robin,

Thank you for your response and that it was not just me not being able to find something!

Are you saying that I simply add the domain to the AWS system but the problem is that I would need to log onto the Zen interface to change the email pointers so I would need to know what is the address that I need to point the MX record to?

As ever thank you for your help"
Amazon WorkMail	"Re: Pointing a domain to Amazon work mail
Hi,

When you add a domain in WorkMail it will show all required records. Once you have added a domain in the WorkMail console it will not effect your current mail flow or WorkMail organization. So you can safely add your domain to the WorkMail organization. 

Once that is done you will get to a domain details page where you can see the verification status per domain record.

Since WorkMail is a service it will not be reliable to use a IP of the end-points. These IPs might change and will leave your domains pointing to the wrong IPs. The WorkMail console shows all domain records you need to create as CNAME records.

I have one final query which is about spam control - does AWS email have a spam control dashboard of some sort which allows, for example, specification of what happens to emails coming into names that are not on the domain?"
Amazon WorkMail	"Re: Pointing a domain to Amazon work mail
Hi,

For the domain records with a underscore, the SES console (SES handles the domain verification) mentions: If your DNS provider does not allow underscores in record names, you can omit _amazonses from the record name. To help you easily identify this record within your domain's DNS settings, you can optionally prefix the record value with amazonses:

I am not sure if this also applies to the _dmarc domain record. I will ask the service team if they can answer that.

For the spam control dashboard, I'm sorry to report that this is not available with WorkMail yet. I know ""message tracking"" and ""Catch all email addresses"" are two feature that are on their roadmap but there is no ETA for either of them.

Kind regards,
Robin"
Amazon WorkMail	"Re: Pointing a domain to Amazon work mail
Good afternoon,

The simple answer to my question about DNS is that if you add a domain to an existing AWS work mail organisation it gives you all of the DNS settings that you need.

Obviously I was being misleading about IP addresses as I believe these will reset automatically based on the other settings in the domain Control Panel.

Amazon WorkMail	"Re: Pointing a domain to Amazon work mail
Hi Andy,

If you are looking for a client that can combine Mail and Calendar I suggest looking for one that can do EWS. IMAP and SMTP are mailing protocols and to sync calendar items you will need to do this via EWS or active sync.

for Exchange ActiveSync - out of date in that it is not compatible with 
the current version of Thunderbird

Hi,

Yes, I was talking about Exchange Web Services, this protocol is used by Mac Outlook and native Mac applications. This can also be used via the EWS managed api.

If you want want use Windows Outlook you can use the auto discover server to auto configure a profile for you.

Amazon WorkMail	"Re: Pointing a domain to Amazon work mail
Hi Andy,

I checked with the service team and it looks like you're connecting to WorkMail via IMAP. This means that it might be required to ""subscribe"" to folders to be able to see them. 

If you want to configure your profile for EWS you can use Mac Outlook and automatic configuration. The service team mentioned that your Outlook version looked like the Windows Outlook version. In that case you cannot connect to EWS but to its own protocol. Again the automatic configuration for this should work.

Hi,

This is another request for this functionality.

Without this direct migration path this is very painful to get to an operational state.

You are essentially stuck with having to drag and drop each individual folder in the users mail hierarchy across to the Workmail instance.

Mac Mail works slightly better than Outlook 2011 for this. But the short answer is that this is really only a path for the die-hards. No end user will put us with this. Performance is miserable, and you will frequently encounter crashes of the clients that puts your exchange folders in spurious states and causes you to either use the workmail web client to delete the folder in question - assuming that you can guess which one it is, or delete your account in the client, let the client start up again and the add the account back.

If this product offering is to be anything but something for Exchange customers then a really good migration tool is a must.

6. Go to john@domain.com and click on the link you just received to confirm the email address
7. In SES > SMTP Settings click on support@domain.com and press the ""Get SMTP Credentials"" button
8. You will be redirected to AWS AIM where you have to choose a username (eg. domain.support.smtp)
9. Complete the wizard and lick ""Show Credentials"", which will show you the username and password for the support@domain.com SMTP login (download or write down)
10. Take note of which location your WorkMail server is (Eg. eu-west-1)
11. Go to www.smtper.net to test your smtp login with the below credentials:

Amazon WorkMail	"Migration from Lotus Notes
Good morning to you all

We are running a test version of AWS mail as a replacement for our Lotus Notes installation as we no longer need to use the database facilities of Notes leaving just the email, calendar and contact list part.

Email is not a problem as we can keep our historic messages locally and refer to them as needed.

However it will be helpful to move calendar and contacts.

If we going to move our domain to AWS mail we could export our contacts to a variety of formats importing including  .vcf

Calendar may be more problematic but it seems we could export it to a .ics file.

Does this sound do-able?

Secondly if I import these into my test domain can I transfer them to the real domain if and when we move across?

And thirdly, having imported it and used them (email contacts and calendar) can we bring those down to a local copy of some sort?

Thank you for your help"
Amazon WorkMail	"Re: Migration from Lotus Notes
Hi,

Good to hear you're interested in using WorkMail, I do have some questions for you. What client are you using right now? 

If you're using Windows Outlook I suggest using a PST export from the Lotus notes user and import this in the WorkMail user to copy everything (Mail, contacts and calendar). If you do not use Windows Outlook it will be harder to import the contacts and calendar items. The WorkMail WebMail client does not offer any import functions so it will come down to the client you're using. 

For using a test domain, with WorkMail you get a complementary .awsapps.com domain that you can use for testing. You can also add your own domain without impact on your current set-up. If you add your domain and verify the ownership but don't create any of the other required records (Mainly MX and auto discover records), you will be able to add your domain to all users but mail will still go to the old mail stack.

For a local copy, this again comes down to the client you are using. WorkMail offer support for most mail clients over varying protocols so it should not be a problem to find a client that suits your needs for this.

If you have any more questions feel free to ask.

Kind regards,

I'll try a test and see what happens.

I already have a complementary .awsapps.com domain that I am using for testing. 

Concerning adding our own domain without impact on your current set-up - there seems to be no point in that if we do not point the MX records across?

Presumably if I keep on carrying on using Outlook locally or even go back to Thunderbird or some other off-line reader I would still have the benefit of the one-off import of my previous email, contacts, and diary?

The only thing that worries me is the size of the import as we are a bit lackadaisical in closing down and opening new mail files for our users and so they tend to grow quite large - what is the file size limit in work mail and what of the charges if we go over that limit?

Amazon WorkMail	"Re: Migration from Lotus Notes
Hi,

You're welcome, glad I was able to shed some light. For the new questions yes, the MX record defines where email will go, if that is Lotus Notes mail will go there. So you can add the domain to WorkMail safely, so you can configure it as email address for your users. Once you are ready flip over, you update the MX record and your users can start using WorkMail. 

If you used Outlook to export your current store it will make it easy to import into WorkMail. This should include all items that can be exported to PST. For Email rules, you can also make an export using Windows Outlook and re-import this in the WorkMail user store. For usage afterwards, Thunderbird should be good to view mail offline but it will only offer mail. For Calendar and Contacts you might want to use Windows Outlook or and EWS capable client.

For sizes and limits in WorkMail. The maximum size of emails in WorkMail is 25MB, larger files will not be synced to the server if you import these in WorkMail. The maximum user store size this is 50GB. You cannot go over this so it will also not incur any more costs that the normal $4 per user per month.

Kind regards,
Robin"
Amazon WorkMail	"Re: Migration from Lotus Notes
Good afternoon

Again thanks

Noted about ""flip over"" etc

I opened Outlook on my local workstation which I do not usually use and tried the import into it from Lotus Notes having established a connection from Outlook to the test account.

Unfortunately the export did not work properly I ended up with a whole bunch of email headers with no content and no differentiation between email calendar and address book items.

Is there any easy way of deleting all of these from my account and where is the best place to delete them from?  Would it be in Outlook?

And will that then replicate?

Or should I simply dump the dump the test account and open another one?"
Amazon WorkMail	"Re: Migration from Lotus Notes
Hi,

If you're using a test account that you will not use, the fastest way to get a empty mailbox will be to create a new user. Do note that when disabling and enabling a user will not give you an empty mailbox as WorkMail will only delete a mailbox for a user that has been disabled after 30 days. 

If you remove all all mail in Outlook it will sync this to the server, removing all mail from the server. Again the items will still be in ""Recover deleted items"" for 30 days.

Kind regards,
Robin"

Hi Guss,

What email domain are using in the email address?
If it's <organizationname>.awsapps.com it should work fine. 

When you are using your own domain, it's important the MX record is pointed to WorkMail or your email are forwarded from your other email server.

Only switch your MX records when you have all email addresses (both users and distribution lists) created on WorkMail and your original mailbox migrated.

Amazon WorkMail	"Re: Can send email but i can't receive it from my workmail account.
Yes, you can slowly transition to Amazon WorkMail.
For this you want to setup an dual or split delivery setup. Below the steps to accomplish this:

1. Add your domains to WorkMail
2. Verify the domain ownership by adding the TXT verification record
3. Add your users to WorkMail and set the primary address to their current Exchange address
4. Add an email alias to each user with the <alias>.awsapps.com domain. This address is used to receive email forwards.
5. Enabling forwarding for users to their (...@<alias>.awsapps.com) in the Exchange Management Console (recipient configuration > Mailbox > User > Mail Flow settings > Delivery options)/
You can decide to still keep a copy in Exchange if you are running WorkMail in a PoC setup.
6. Once all users are migrated you can switch the MX record to WorkMail.

When setting up the Outlook client make sure you use the email alias as login name, otherwise the autodiscover process will resolve the user back to the Exchange server.

With the above steps you can run part of the users on WorkMail, while they can still use their email address. 

If you want to have an unified global address book between Exchange and WorkMail you can have to add/enable the users and distribution groups in WorkMail. Currently you can't share free/busy calendar information between WorkMail and Exchange.

Let me know if you have any questions about this setup.

Hi Milo,

So far here is what i did. also thank you for the response:

1. Add your domains to WorkMail = DONE
2. Verify the domain ownership by adding the TXT verification record = DONE
3. Add your users to WorkMail and set the primary address to their current Exchange address
I did not use the current address instead I created new email address that is not in the exchange of hostway. ( I have new employee named ""anne"" and I created a user on AWS using the verified domain from hostway , this user has no current email address in the exchange server of hostway) it is now anne.marie@hostwaydomain.com

4. Add an email alias to each user with the <alias>.awsapps.com domain. This address is used to receive email forwards.
=I dont know where i can add an email alias on AWS , do i need the alias if i created a new user on AWS but no current email address in the exchange server?

5. Enabling forwarding for users to their (...@<alias>.awsapps.com) in the Exchange Management Console (recipient configuration > Mailbox > User > Mail Flow settings > Delivery options)/

-jeff"
Amazon WorkMail	"Re: Can send email but i can't receive it from my workmail account.
Hi Jeff,

4. You can add an email alias to a user by opening the AWS Management Console, selecting the user, and pressing edit. In the edit view you can add additional email addresses to the user.

5. It depends on the Exchange version. For Exchange 2013 you can access the exchange console by accessing https://exchange_url/ecp. It looks like hostway runs Exchange 2010 and provides an own control panel for management.
Can you add in the control panel a new mail user? 
A mail user is a user without a mailbox where you can also add an external address. All emails send to this user will be forwarded to the external address.


what is poc setup?

Amazon WorkMail	"Re: Can send email but i can't receive it from my workmail account.
Hi,

If you do not want to use a S3 bucket to save email I suggest to remove that rule. You can do this by going to the SES console and in the menu bar select ""Rule Sets"" in the Email Receiving section. On that page click ""View Active Rule Set"".

The rule for WorkMail will be named something like: m-f34b61e100ad47a88866b30ea043c113. You can also check the actions of the rules, the WorkMail rule will have 1 action called ""WorkMail Action"".

You can remove the S3 rule and then email should arrive at WorkMail and will be visible in the WorkMail WebMail client.

If there is only 1 rule which contains multiple actions, you can open that rule and remove S3 action. Then only the WorkMail action remains.

Amazon WorkMail	"Feature request: exclude pattern for outbound mail flow rule
Hi there,

I'm very happy with the SMTP Gateway option, great stuff. One thing that would be fantastic to have is the option to exclude domains from the mail flow rule for destinations domains. So you might get:

!myowndomain.com
*

Meaning: deliver everything to the SMTP Gateway except recipients in myowndomain.com. This avoids processing internal mail via the SMTP Gateway or any other recipient domain you don't wish to route via SMTP Gateway.

Hope this makes sense, feel free to reach out if I need to clarify more.

Kind regards
Meint"

Amazon WorkMail	"Re: Feature request: exclude pattern for outbound mail flow rule
Hi,

Glad to hear you're happy with the SMTP gateway feature and that you found a solution for the problem you faced. One question regarding the STMP gateway documentation, did you missing anything from our documentation that would have helped understanding how the rule work? If you have any comments or questions, feel free to post them.

Also have you seen the latest feature release for Outbound rules? You can now execute a Lambda for outgoing mail.

Kind regards,
Robin"
Amazon WorkMail	"Re: Feature request: exclude pattern for outbound mail flow rule
Hi Robin,

It wasnt directly clear to me how the outbound rules interacted, I'm used to mail flow rules in Exchange/O365 and there you have precedence in the rules which isn't the case with Workmail. Not an issue but it didn't directly click in my head how Workmail operates.

It might help other customers if the documentation makes a specific notice how to exclude internal email from the outbound rule in combination with the SMTP Gateway, ie something like:

""If you're sending all your outbound email via the SMTP Gateway and you want to exclude your internal email you need to create an additional rule where you define the 'Default' action with your own domain as destination"".

Or something to that wording, I expect this is a common scenario/question for many companies that do outbound filtering (spam, virus, DLP).

Thanks for taking the time to respond to my spurious question 

Kind regards
Meint"

Hi Meint,

Thank you for your reply, this is indeed a good suggestion. I will pass this to the service team.

Amazon WorkMail	"Feature request: smart host / mail relay integration
Hi, with Office 365, Exchange and G-Suite i have the option of sending traffic for certain addresses (or domains) to a smart host rather than send out directly. The smart host might have the function of an outbound spam filter, policy server or DLP engine. 

Connection to the smart host would ideally be protected by TLS and uses SASL for authentication. The mail servers I mentioned all have the ability to define (send) connectors where you can configure settings for a smart host (host, TLS settings, domain scope), a (distribution) group where you can isolate addresses/domains that can use the connector and a mail rule that ties them together (""If somebody from this group emails use send connector x"").

I would like to request this feature as I think this is essential for any larger corporation with an extensive security policy / perimeter approach."

Amazon WorkMail	"Changed password, now can't access my account
I changed my WorkMail password yesterday and as a result can no longer access mail in any account,

iOS on iPad, macOS on my MacBook in both Outlook and Mac mail or via the webpage.

I have gone into the console and reset the password multiple times to no avail and used both simple and complex passwords, which always succeed by the way.

I still have access to mail accounts where I have not reset the password so I know it is not my network.

when I try to access my mail from my MacBook I get the following error

The server for account ""Mike"" returned the error ""Logon failure: unknown user name or bad password."" Your username/password or security settings may be incorrect. Would you like to try re-entering your password?

When using the web page I get this error

Authentication Failed
Please check your username and password to make sure you typed them correctly.

And to be certain I copied and pasted the password into both the password reset and logon page.


Update - When I reset my password yet again this morning, after 15 minutes my accounts started working. But within 2 hours they had all stopped again with invalid password so something is invalidating my password in the background."

In General, for anyone who runs in to the similar issues, you can use https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com tool to check your Autodiscover setup. 

The steps are:

1) go to https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com
2) choose Microsoft Office Outlook Connectivity Tests / Outlook Autodiscover
3) press Next
4) type:
4.1) Email address - your email address, e.g.user@company.tld
4.2) Domain\User Name (or UPN): - type e.g. company.tld\user
4.3) Password \ Confirm password - WorkMail user password
4.4) Ignore Trust for SSL - keep unselected
4.5) I understand that I must use the credentials... - select this
4.6) Verification - type the code on the picture
5) press Perform Test

Result of the test should be successful. If it is not, then you have some issues with WorkMail Autodiscover setup. Please go to WorkMail console and follow instructions given there. You also can consider configuring Autodiscover Phase 2 for you organization, see: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workmail/latest/adminguide/autodiscover.html but this configuration is optional."

Amazon WorkMail	"awsapps.com mail vs hosted zone domain workmail
so far setting up workmail seems to set up an awsapps.com user email before setting up the hosted zone email user.  Are these considered 2 separate users, ie, $4 per user per month?  If so, how to set up the hosted zone email in workmail without setting up the awsapps.com email ?"
Amazon WorkMail	"Re: awsapps.com mail vs hosted zone domain workmail
Hi,

Thank you for your interest in WorkMail. The awsapps.com domain that you get with every WorkMail organization does not cost you a thing. The $4 is per user an not per email address. You can have up to 100 email addresses per user. So having 1 user with 3 email addresses will cost you $4 per month. 

If you want to add your own domain to WorkMail you can visit this documentation page for more information: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workmail/latest/adminguide/domains_overview.html

For more details on the WorkMail limits please visit: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workmail/latest/adminguide/workmail_limits.html

Kind regards,
Robin"
Amazon WorkMail	"Re: awsapps.com mail vs hosted zone domain workmail
Thanks.  To clarify, are you stating 100 email address per user meaning ""alias forward"" or actually mailboxes that can send and receive?

Do you set up awsapps.com user for each hosted domain that is added or one awsapps.com user account per aws account? 

possible to change the user name for awsapps.com email or will that affect the hosted zone domain user account?

somehow how seem to be getting awsapps.com email in the hosted domain in box, so what is the connect between these two accounts?"
Amazon WorkMail	"Re: awsapps.com mail vs hosted zone domain workmail
Hi,

These are some good questions, maybe the WorkMail documentation need some updates to clarify this. 

For the 100 email addresses, a user can have 1 primary email address and 99 email aliases. A user can use all 100 to send and receive mail. But on inbound mail WorkMail will resolve aliases to the primary email address. So Inbound mail always shows the primary email address in the ""To"". The original alias is still shown in the message headers. 

The complementary .awsapps.com domain that you receive with the organization is linked to the organization. You can use it for all users in your organization but you cannot change this domain as it's tied to the organization name. Also only 1 .awsapps.com domain per organization can be used and it's listed in the the domain page of the WorkMail as its part of the organization. 

A good reason to have and keep a awsapps.com email on your users is to have an easy autodiscover domain for all accounts. For instance IOS has strict requirements for autodiscover and the ""phase 3"" we supply by default on custom domains is not sufficient. Using the awsapps.com email address during set-up will work and the primary email address will be used after account set-up is complete. 

I hope this answers your questions, if you have any more feel free to post them.

Kind regards,
Robin"
