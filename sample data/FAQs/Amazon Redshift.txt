Q: What is Amazon Redshift?
Amazon Redshift is a fast, fully managed data warehouse that makes it simple and cost-effective to analyze all your data using standard SQL and your existing Business Intelligence (BI) tools. It allows you to run complex analytic queries against petabytes of structured data, using sophisticated query optimization, columnar storage on high-performance local disks, and massively parallel query execution. Most results come back in seconds. With Redshift, you can start small for just $0.25 per hour with no commitments and scale out to petabytes of data for $1,000 per terabyte per year, less than a tenth the cost of traditional solutions. Amazon Redshift also includes Amazon Redshift Spectrum, allowing you to directly run SQL queries against exabytes of unstructured data in Amazon S3. No loading or transformation is required, and you can use open data formats, including Avro, CSV, Grok, Ion, JSON, ORC, Parquet, RCFile, RegexSerDe, SequenceFile, TextFile, and TSV. Redshift Spectrum automatically scales query compute capacity based on the data being retrieved, so queries against Amazon S3 run fast, regardless of data set size.
Traditional data warehouses require significant time and resource to administer, especially for large datasets. In addition, the financial cost associated with building, maintaining, and growing self-managed, on-premise data warehouses is very high. As your data grows, you have to constantly trade-off what data to load into your data warehouse and what data to archive in storage so you can manage costs, keep ETL complexity low, and deliver good performance. Amazon Redshift not only significantly lowers the cost and operational overhead of a data warehouse, but with Redshift Spectrum, also makes it easy to analyze large amounts of data in its native format without requiring you to load the data.
Amazon Redshift gives you fast querying capabilities over structured data using familiar SQL-based clients and business intelligence (BI) tools using standard ODBC and JDBC connections. Queries are distributed and parallelized across multiple physical resources. You can easily scale an Amazon Redshift data warehouse up or down with a few clicks in the AWS Management Console or with a single API call. Amazon Redshift automatically patches and backs up your data warehouse, storing the backups for a user-defined retention period. Amazon Redshift uses replication and continuous backups to enhance availability and improve data durability and can automatically recover from component and node failures. In addition, Amazon Redshift supports Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), SSL, AES-256 encryption and Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) to protect your data in transit and at rest.
As with all Amazon Web Services, there are no up-front investments required, and you pay only for the resources you use. Amazon Redshift lets you pay as you go. You can even try Amazon Redshift for free.

Q: What is Redshift Spectrum?
Redshift Spectrum is a feature of Amazon Redshift that enables you to run queries against exabytes of unstructured data in Amazon S3, with no loading or ETL required. When you issue a query, it goes to the Amazon Redshift SQL endpoint, which generates and optimizes a query plan. Amazon Redshift determines what data is local and what is in Amazon S3, generates a plan to minimize the amount of Amazon S3 data that needs to be read, requests Redshift Spectrum workers out of a shared resource pool to read and process data from Amazon S3.
Redshift Spectrum scales out to thousands of instances if needed, so queries run quickly regardless of data size. And, you can use the exact same SQL for Amazon S3 data as you do for your Amazon Redshift queries today and connect to the same Amazon Redshift endpoint using your same BI tools. Redshift Spectrum lets you separate storage and compute, allowing you to scale each independently. You can setup as many Amazon Redshift clusters as you need to query your Amazon S3 data lake, providing high availability and limitless concurrency. Redshift Spectrum gives you the freedom to store your data where you want, in the format you want, and have it available for processing when you need it.
For information about Redshift Spectrum regional availability, please visit the Amazon Redshift pricing page.
Q: What does Amazon Redshift manage on my behalf?
Amazon Redshift manages the work needed to set up, operate, and scale a data warehouse, from provisioning the infrastructure capacity to automating ongoing administrative tasks such as backups, and patching. Amazon Redshift automatically monitors your nodes and drives to help you recover from failures. For Redshift Spectrum, Amazon Redshift manages all the computing infrastructure, load balancing, planning, scheduling and execution of your queries on data stored in Amazon S3.
Q: How does the performance of Amazon Redshift compare to most traditional databases for data warehousing and analytics?
Amazon Redshift uses a variety of innovations to achieve up to ten times higher performance than traditional databases for data warehousing and analytics workloads:
Q: How do I get started with Amazon Redshift?
You can sign up and get started within minutes from the Amazon Redshift detail page or via the AWS Management Console. If you don't already have an AWS account, you'll be prompted to create one.
To use Redshift Spectrum, you need to first store your data in Amazon S3. You can then define the metadata about that data in your Amazon Redshift cluster or register the metadata you may already have in your Hive metastore with your cluster. You can issue a CREATE EXTERNAL SCHEMA SQL command in your Amazon Redshift cluster to define or register a database in your catalog as an external schema within Amazon Redshift. You can then issue queries against Amazon S3 using the same SQL you use for local tables and any BI tool that supports Amazon Redshift today. The external database definition you create using Amazon Redshift SQL is registered in the same data catalog that Amazon Athena uses. You can optionally manage the external database definition from the Amazon Athena Catalog as well.
Visit our Getting Started page to see how to try Amazon Redshift for free.
Q: How do I create and access an Amazon Redshift data warehouse cluster?
You can easily create an Amazon Redshift data warehouse cluster by using the AWS Management Console or the Amazon Redshift APIs. You can start with a single node, 160GB data warehouse and scale all the way to a petabyte or more with a few clicks in the AWS Console or a single API call.
The single node configuration enables you to get started with Amazon Redshift quickly and cost-effectively and scale up to a multi-node configuration as your needs grow.Â A Redshift data warehouse cluster can contain from 1-128 compute nodes, depending on the node type. For details please see our documentation.
The multi-node configuration requires a leader node that manages client connections and receives queries, and two compute nodes that store data and perform queries and computations. The leader node is provisioned for you automatically and you are not charged for it.
Simply specify your preferred Availability Zone (optional), the number of nodes, node types, a master name and password, security groups, your preferences for backup retention, and other system settings. Once you've chosen your desired configuration, Amazon Redshift will provision the required resources and set up your data warehouse cluster.
Once your data warehouse cluster is available, you can retrieve its endpoint and JDBC and ODBC connection string from the AWS Management Console or by using the Redshift APIs. You can then use this connection string with your favorite database tool, programming language, or Business Intelligence (BI) tool. You will need to authorize network requests to your running data warehouse cluster. For a detailed explanation please refer to our Getting Started Guide.
Q: What does a leader node do? What does a compute node do?
A leader node receives queries from client applications, parses the queries and develops execution plans, which are an ordered set of steps to process these queries. The leader node then coordinates the parallel execution of these plans with the compute nodes, aggregates the intermediate results from these nodes and finally returns the results back to the client applications.
Compute nodes execute the steps specified in the execution plans and transmit data among themselves to serve these queries. The intermediate results are sent back to the leader node for aggregation before being sent back to the client applications.
Q: What is the maximum storage capacity per compute node? What is the recommended amount of data per compute node for optimal performance?
You can create a cluster using either Dense Storage (DS) node types or Dense Compute (DC) node types. Dense Storage node types enable you to create very large data warehouses using hard disk drives (HDDs) for a very low price point. Dense Compute node types enable you to create very high performance data warehouses using fast CPUs, large amounts of RAM and solid-state disks (SSDs).
Dense Storage (DS) node types are available in two sizes, Extra Large and Eight Extra Large. The Extra Large (XL) has 3 HDDs with a total of 2TB of magnetic storage, whereas Eight Extra Large (8XL) has 24 HDDs with a total of 16TB of magnetic storage. DS2.8XLarge has 36 Intel Xeon E5-2676 v3 (Haswell) virtual cores and 244GiB of RAM, and DS2.XL has 4 Intel Xeon E5-2676 v3 (Haswell) virtual cores and 31GiB of RAM. Please see our pricing page for more detail. You can get started with a single Extra Large node, 2TB data warehouse for $0.85 per hour and scale up to a petabyte or more. You can pay by the hour or use reserved instance pricing to lower your price to under $1,000 per TB per year.
Dense Compute (DC) node types are also available in two sizes. The Large has 160GB of SSD storage, 2 Intel Xeon E5-2670v2 (Ivy Bridge) virtual cores and 15GiB of RAM. The Eight Extra Large is sixteen times bigger with 2.56TB of SSD storage, 32 Intel Xeon E5-2670v2 virtual cores and 244GiB of RAM. You can get started with a single DC2.Large node for $0.25 per hour and scale all the way up to 128 8XL nodes with 326TB of SSD storage, 3,200 virtual cores and 24TiB of RAM.
Amazon Redshift's MPP architecture means you can increase your performance by increasing the number of nodes in your data warehouse cluster. The optimal amount of data per compute node depends on your application characteristics and your query performance needs. An Amazon Redshift data warehouse cluster can contain from 1-128 compute nodes, depending on the node type. For details please see our documentation.
Q: When would I use Amazon Redshift vs. Amazon RDS?
Both Amazon Redshift and Amazon RDS enable you to run traditional relational databases in the cloud while offloading database administration. Customers use Amazon RDS databases both for online-transaction processing (OLTP) and for reporting and analysis. Amazon Redshift harnesses the scale and resources of multiple nodes and uses a variety of optimizations to provide order of magnitude improvements over traditional databases for analytic and reporting workloads against very large data sets. Amazon Redshift provides an excellent scale-out option as your data and query complexity grows or if you want to prevent your reporting and analytic processing from interfering with the performance of your OLTP workload.
Q: When would I use Amazon Redshift or Redshift Spectrum vs. Amazon EMR?
You should use Amazon EMR if you use custom code to process and analyze extremely large datasets with big data processing frameworks such as Apache Spark, Hadoop, Presto, or Hbase. Amazon EMR gives you full control over the configuration of your clusters and the software you install on them.
Data warehouses like Amazon Redshift are designed for a different type of analytics altogether. Data warehouses are designed to pull together data from lots of different sources, like inventory, financial, and retail sales systems. In order to ensure that reporting is consistently accurate across the entire company, data warehouses store data in a highly structured fashion. This structure builds data consistency rules directly into the tables of the database. Amazon Redshift is the best service to use when you need to perform complex queries on massive collections of structured data and get superfast performance.
While Redshift Spectrum is great for running queries against data in Amazon Redshift and S3, it really isnât a fit for the types of use cases that enterprises typically ask from processing frameworks like Amazon EMR. Amazon EMR goes far beyond just running SQL queries. Amazon EMR is a managed service that lets you process and analyze extremely large data sets using the latest versions of popular big data processing frameworks, such as Spark, Hadoop, and Presto, on fully customizable clusters. With Amazon EMR you can run a wide variety of scale-out data processing tasks for applications such as machine learning, graph analytics, data transformation, streaming data, and virtually anything you can code.
You can use Redshift Spectrum together with EMR. Redshift Spectrum uses the same approach to store table definitions as Amazon EMR. Redshift Spectrum can support the same Apache Hive Metastore used by Amazon EMR to locate data and table definitions. If youâre using Amazon EMR and have a Hive Metastore already, you just have to configure your Amazon Redshift cluster to use it. You can then start querying that data right away along with your Amazon EMR jobs. So, if youâre already using EMR to process a large data store, you can use Redshift Spectrum to query that data right at the same time without interfering with your Amazon EMR jobs.
Query services, data warehouses, and complex data processing frameworks all have their place, and they are used for different things. You just need to choose the right tool for the job.

Q: When should I use Amazon Athena vs. Redshift Spectrum?
Amazon Athena is the simplest way to give any employee the ability to run ad-hoc queries on data in Amazon S3. Athena is serverless, so there is no infrastructure to setup or manage, and you can start analyzing your data immediately.
If you have frequently accessed data, that needs to be stored in a consistent, highly structured format, then you should use a data warehouse like Amazon Redshift. This gives you the flexibility to store your structured, frequently accessed data in Amazon Redshift, and use Redshift Spectrum to extend your Amazon Redshift queries out to the entire universe of data in your Amazon S3 data lake. This gives you the freedom to store your data where you want, in the format you want, and have it available for processing when you need.
Q: Why should I use Amazon Redshift instead of running my own MPP data warehouse cluster on Amazon EC2?
Amazon Redshift automatically handles many of the time-consuming tasks associated with managing your own data warehouse including:
Q: How will I be charged and billed for my use of Amazon Redshift?
You pay only for what you use, and there are no minimum or setup fees. Billing commences for a data warehouse cluster as soon as the data warehouse cluster is available. Billing continues until the data warehouse cluster terminates, which would occur upon deletion or in the event of instance failure. You are billed based on:
Except as otherwise noted, our prices are exclusive of applicable taxes and duties, including VAT and applicable sales tax. For customers with a Japanese billing address, use of AWS services is subject to Japanese Consumption Tax. Learn more.
For Amazon Redshift pricing information, please visit the Amazon Redshift pricing page.
Q: How do I load data into my Amazon Redshift data warehouse?
You can load data into Amazon Redshift from a range of data sources including Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon EMR, AWS Glue, AWS Data Pipeline and or any SSH-enabled host on Amazon EC2 or on-premises. Amazon Redshift attempts to load your data in parallel into each compute node to maximize the rate at which you can ingest data into your data warehouse cluster. For more details on loading data into Amazon Redshift please view our Getting Started Guide.
Yes, clients can connect to Amazon Redshift using ODBC or JDBC and issue 'insert' SQL commands to insert the data. Please note this is slower than using S3 or DynamoDB since those methods load data in parallel to each compute node while SQL insert statements load via the single leader node.
Q: How do I load data from my existing Amazon RDS, Amazon EMR, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon EC2 data sources to Amazon Redshift?
You can use our COPY command to load data in parallel directly to Amazon Redshift from Amazon EMR, Amazon DynamoDB, or any SSH-enabled host. Redshift Spectrum also enables you to load data from Amazon S3 into your cluster with a simple INSERT INTO command. This could enable you to load data from various formats such as Parquet and RC into your cluster. Note that if you use this approach, you will accrue Redshift Spectrum charges for the data scanned from Amazon S3.
In addition, many ETL companies have certified Amazon Redshift for use with their tools, and a number are offering free trials to help you get started loading your data. AWS Data Pipeline provides a high performance, reliable, fault tolerant solution to load data from a variety of AWS data sources. You can use AWS Data Pipeline to specify the data source, desired data transformations, and then execute a pre-written import script to load your data into Amazon Redshift. Also, AWS Glue is a fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that makes it easy to prepare and load data for analytics. You can create and run an AWS Glue ETL job with a few clicks in the AWS Management Console.
Q: I have a lot of data for initial loading into Amazon Redshift. Transferring via the Internet would take a long time. How do I load this data?
You can use AWS Import/Export to transfer the data to Amazon S3 using portable storage devices. In addition, you can use AWS Direct Connect to establish a private network connection between your network or datacenter and AWS. You can choose 1Gbit/sec or 10Gbit/sec connection ports to transfer your data.
Q: How does Amazon Redshift keep my data secure?
Amazon Redshift encrypts and keeps your data secure in transit and at rest using industry-standard encryption techniques. To keep data secure in transit, Amazon Redshift supports SSL-enabled connections between your client application and your Redshift data warehouse cluster. To keep your data secure at rest, Amazon Redshift encrypts each block using hardware-accelerated AES-256 as it is written to disk. This takes place at a low level in the I/O subsystem, which encrypts everything written to disk, including intermediate query results. The blocks are backed up as is, which means that backups are encrypted as well. By default, Amazon Redshift takes care of key management but you can choose to manage your keys using your own hardware security modules (HSMs) or manage your keys through AWS Key Management Service.
Redshift Spectrum supports Amazon S3âs Server Side Encryption (SSE) using your accountâs default key managed used by the AWS Key Management Service (KMS).
Q: Can I use Amazon Redshift in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)?
Yes, you can use Amazon Redshift as part of your VPC configuration. With Amazon VPC, you can define a virtual network topology that closely resembles a traditional network that you might operate in your own datacenter. This gives you complete control over who can access your Amazon Redshift data warehouse cluster.
You can use Redshift Spectrum with an Amazon Redshift cluster that is part of your VPC. Note that Redshift Spectrum does not currently support Enhanced VPC Routing.
Q: Can I access my Amazon Redshift compute nodes directly?
No. Your Amazon Redshift compute nodes are in a private network space and can only be accessed from your data warehouse cluster's leader node. This provides an additional layer of security for your data.
Q: What happens to my data warehouse cluster availability and data durability if a drive on one of my nodes fails?
Your Amazon Redshift data warehouse cluster will remain available in the event of a drive failure however you may see a slight decline in performance for certain queries. In the event of a drive failure, Amazon Redshift will transparently use a replica of the data on that drive which is stored on other drives within that node. In addition, Amazon Redshift will attempt to move your data to a healthy drive or will replace your node if it is unable to do so. Single node clusters do not support data replication. In the event of a drive failure you will need to restore the cluster from snapshot on S3. We recommend using at least two nodes for production.
Q: What happens to my data warehouse cluster availability and data durability in the event of individual node failure?
Amazon Redshift will automatically detect and replace a failed node in your data warehouse cluster. The data warehouse cluster will be unavailable for queries and updates until a replacement node is provisioned and added to the DB. Amazon Redshift makes your replacement node available immediately and loads your most frequently accessed data from S3 first to allow you to resume querying your data as quickly as possible. Single node clusters do not support data replication. In the event of a drive failure you will need to restore the cluster from snapshot on S3. We recommend using at least two nodes for production.
Q: What happens to my data warehouse cluster availability and data durability if my data warehouse cluster's Availability Zone (AZ) has an outage?
If your Amazon Redshift data warehouse cluster's Availability Zone becomes unavailable, you will not be able to use your cluster until power and network access to the AZ are restored. Your data warehouse cluster's data is preserved so you can start using your Amazon Redshift data warehouse as soon as the AZ becomes available again. In addition, you can also choose to restore any existing snapshots to a new AZ in the same Region. Amazon Redshift will restore your most frequently accessed data first so you can resume queries as quickly as possible.
Q: Does Amazon Redshift support Multi-AZ Deployments?
Currently, Amazon Redshift only supports Single-AZ deployments. You can run data warehouse clusters in multiple AZ's by loading data into two Amazon Redshift data warehouse clusters in separate AZs from the same set of Amazon S3 input files. With Redshift Spectrum, you can spin up multiple clusters across AZs and access data in Amazon S3 without having to load it into your cluster. In addition, you can also restore a data warehouse cluster to a different AZ from your data warehouse cluster snapshots.
Q: How does Amazon Redshift back up my data? How do I restore my cluster from a backup?
Amazon Redshift replicates all your data within your data warehouse cluster when it is loaded and also continuously backs up your data to S3. Amazon Redshift always attempts to maintain at least three copies of your data (the original and replica on the compute nodes and a backup in Amazon S3). Redshift can also asynchronously replicate your snapshots to S3 in another region for disaster recovery.
By default, Amazon Redshift enables automated backups of your data warehouse cluster with a 1-day retention period. You can configure this to be as long as 35 days.
Free backup storage is limited to the total size of storage on the nodes in the data warehouse cluster and only applies to active data warehouse clusters. For example, if you have total data warehouse storage of 8TB, we will provide at most 8TB of backup storage at no additional charge. If you would like to extend your backup retention period beyond one day, you can do so using the AWS Management Console or the Amazon Redshift APIs. For more information on automated snapshots, please refer to the Amazon Redshift Management Guide. Amazon Redshift only backs up data that has changed so most snapshots only use up a small amount of your free backup storage.
When you need to restore a backup, you have access to all the automated backups within your backup retention window. Once you choose a backup from which to restore, we will provision a new data warehouse cluster and restore your data to it.
Q: How do I manage the retention of my automated backups and snapshots?
You can use the AWS Management Console or ModifyCluster API to manage the period of time your automated backups are retained by modifying the RetentionPeriod parameter. If you desire to turn off automated backups altogether, you can do so by setting the retention period to 0 (not recommended).
Q: What happens to my backups if I delete my data warehouse cluster?
When you delete a data warehouse cluster, you have the ability to specify whether a final snapshot is created upon deletion, which enables a restore of the deleted data warehouse cluster at a later date. All previously created manual snapshots of your data warehouse cluster will be retained and billed at standard Amazon S3 rates, unless you choose to delete them.
Q: How do I scale the size and performance of my Amazon Redshift data warehouse cluster?
If you would like to increase query performance or respond to CPU, memory or I/O over-utilization, you can increase the number of nodes within your data warehouse cluster via the AWS Management Console or the ModifyCluster API. When you modify your data warehouse cluster, your requested changes will be applied immediately. Metrics for compute utilization, storage utilization, and read/write traffic to your Amazon Redshift data warehouse cluster are available free of charge via the AWS Management Console or Amazon CloudWatch APIs. You can also add additional, user-defined metrics via Amazon Cloudwatch custom metric functionality.
With Redshift Spectrum, you can run multiple Amazon Redshift clusters accessing the same data in Amazon S3. You can use different clusters for different use cases. For example, you can use one cluster for standard reporting and another for data science queries. Your marketing team can use their own clusters different from your operations team. Depending on the type and number of nodes in your local cluster, and the number of files need to be processed for your query, Redshift Spectrum automatically distributes the execution of your query to several Redshift Spectrum workers out of a shared resource pool to read and process data from Amazon S3, and pulls results back into your Amazon Redshift cluster for any remaining processing.
Q: Will my data warehouse cluster remain available during scaling?
The existing data warehouse cluster remains available for read operations while a new data warehouse cluster gets created during scaling operations. When the new data warehouse cluster is ready, your existing data warehouse cluster will be temporarily unavailable while the canonical name record of the existing data warehouse cluster is flipped to point to the new data warehouse cluster. This period of unavailability typically lasts only a few minutes, and will occur during the maintenance window for your data warehouse cluster, unless you specify that the modification should be applied immediately. Amazon Redshift moves data in parallel from the compute nodes in your existing data warehouse cluster to the compute nodes in your new cluster. This enables your operation to complete as quickly as possible.
Q: Are Amazon Redshift and Redshift Spectrum compatible with my preferred business intelligence software package and ETL tools?
Amazon Redshift uses industry-standard SQL and is accessed using standard JDBC and ODBC drivers. You can download Amazon Redshift custom JDBC and ODBC drivers from the Connect Client tab of the Redshift Console. We have validated integrations with popular BI and ETL vendors, a number of which are offering free trials to help you get started loading and analyzing your data. You can also go to the AWS Marketplace to deploy and configure solutions designed to work with Amazon Redshift in minutes.
Redshift Spectrum supports all Amazon Redshift client tools. The client tools can continue to connect to the Amazon Redshift cluster endpoint using ODBC or JDBC connections. No changes are required.
You use exactly the same query syntax and have the same query capabilities to access tables in Redshift Spectrum as you have for tables in the local storage of your Redshift cluster. External tables are referenced using the schema name defined in the CREATE EXTERNAL SCHEMA command where they were registered.
Q: What data formats and compression formats does Redshift Spectrum support?
Redshift Spectrum currently supports many open source data formats, including Avro, CSV, Grok, Ion, JSON, ORC, Parquet, RCFile, RegexSerDe, SequenceFile, TextFile, and TSV.
Redshift Spectrum currently supports Gzip and Snappy compression.
Q: What happens if a table in my local storage has the same name as an external table?
Just like with local tables, you can use the schema name to pick exactly which one you mean by using schema_name.table_name in your query.
Q: I use a Hive Metastore to store metadata about my S3 data lake. Can I use Redshift Spectrum?
Yes. The CREATE EXTERNAL SCHEMA command supports Hive Metastores. We do not currently support DDL against the Hive Metastore.
Q: How do I get a list of all external database tables created in my cluster?
You can query the system table SVV_EXTERNAL_TABLES to get that information.
Q: How do I monitor the performance of my Amazon Redshift data warehouse cluster?
Metrics for compute utilization, storage utilization, and read/write traffic to your Amazon Redshift data warehouse cluster are available free of charge via the AWS Management Console or Amazon CloudWatch APIs. You can also add additional, user-defined metrics via Amazon Cloudwatchâs custom metric functionality. In addition to CloudWatch metrics, Amazon Redshift also provides information on query and cluster performance via the AWS Management Console. This information enables you to see which users and queries are consuming the most system resources and diagnose performance issues. In addition, you can see the resource utilization on each of your compute nodes to ensure that you have data and queries that are well balanced across all nodes.
Q: I notice that some queries accessing data in my cluster are running slower than my Redshift Spectrum queries. Why is that?
Amazon Redshift queries are run on your cluster resources against local disk. Redshift Spectrum queries run using per-query scale-out resources against data in S3. For most queries, local disk will be faster, but for queries that scan a lot of data and do minimal compute processing, we can apply a lot of Redshift Spectrum workers and complete them quickly.
Q: What is a maintenance window? Will my data warehouse cluster be available during software maintenance?
Amazon Redshift periodically performs maintenance to apply fixes, enhancements and new features to your cluster. You can change the scheduled maintenance windows by modifying the cluster, either programmatically or by using the Redshift Console. During these maintenance windows, your Amazon Redshift cluster is not available for normal operations. For more information about maintenance windows and schedules by region, see Maintenance Windows in the Amazon Redshift Management Guide.
