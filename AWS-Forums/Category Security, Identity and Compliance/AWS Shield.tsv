AWS Shield	"AWS Shield as a DDoS Service?
Hi,

We are currently hosting some of our services on AWS, and some of our infrastructure on other places.
For one of our servers hosted elsewhere (serving raw TCP traffic, not HTTP/S), we would like to be able to benefit from AWS shield standard protection.
Does AWS Shield Standard protection apply to non-HTTP ports of EC2 instances?
Does it make sense to create an EC2 instance and put a reverse TCP proxy on it? Assuming 2TB of traffic per month, what setup / costs should we be looking at?

AWS Shield	"Shield Standard:  What does it protect
The FAQ and Info online aren't too clear about what services Shield Standard actually protect; I see mention of load balancers, etc. but little specifics.

I'm specifically interested in knowing if Shield Standard protects Elastic IPs allocated in VPCs, and what types of protection are in place (Protection against SYN floods, UDP Floods, ICMP Floods, etc.).

Is there more detailed info available?"
AWS Shield	"Re: Shield Standard:  What does it protect
AWS Shield Standard defends against most common, frequently occurring network and transport layer DDoS attacks that target your web site or applications. On Amazon EC2, your traffic levels are inspected by an auto-mitigation system that can engage when a well-defined DDoS attack signature is detected or at high levels of traffic, given your choice of instance type. UDP reflection attacks, like DNS reflection, NTP reflection, SSDP reflection, etc. are examples of common DDoS attack vectors that can be mitigated by this system.

For improved DDoS resilience across a wide range of attack vectors, like SYN floods or web application layer attacks, consider using Amazon CloudFront or Application Load Balancer (ALB) with AWS WAF. You can also use a Classic Load Balancer for non-web use cases and Amazon Route 53 to also protect against DNS query floods.

You can learn more about these recommendations in the AWS Best Practices for DDoS Resiliency which is available at https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/Security/DDoS_White_Paper.pdf . This paper provides a prescriptive reference architecture you can use to help make your applications more DDoS resilient.

I will reach out to you directly to answer any follow-up questions you might have. I am interested to learn about your application and provide tailored recommendations.

So... more specifically, I'm interested in:  knowing if Shield Standard protects Elastic IPs allocated in VPCs

That is, is it in effect if I'm not using CloudFront or ELBs?  The documentation only mentions these specifically as protected services."
AWS Shield	"Re: Shield Standard:  What does it protect
Yes. AWS Shield Standard provides protection for EIP's in VPC.

Thanks, that was the primary question I had.  Thanks again, have a Happy New Year!"
AWS Shield	"Re: Shield Standard:  What does it protect
Hello Jeffrey and other AWS employees,

Can AWS Shield Standard prevent a volumetric attack from saturating the bandwidth of a small EC2 instance and what will happen if a UDP attack hits a small instance while all UDP is blocked in the security group? Will you ever nullroute the IP, if a huge attack hits us? Layer 7 is not an issue since we'll have efficient rate limits.

I've read the relevant DDoS resiliency whitepaper and your previous answers. It does not answer my question, unfortunately. I need an answer for EC2 only, please.

Thanks in advance."
AWS Shield	"Re: Shield Standard:  What does it protect
AWS Shield Advanced is available for Elastic IP Addresses (EIP's) which allows you to protect Amazon EC2 instances or Network Load Balancers (NLB's). To learn more about AWS Shield Advanced for EIP, see our What's New announcement at https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/11/aws-shield-adds-advanced-ddos-protection-for-ec2-and-network-load-balancer/ .

AWS Shield	"Is AWS Shield Standard automatically enabled for a AWS Beanstalk App?
I'm about to deploy a web app in production using AWS BeanStalk on a single instance (basic tier).

Will my app be automatically protected through AWS Sheild Standard?"
AWS Shield	"Re: Is AWS Shield Standard automatically enabled for a AWS Beanstalk App?
AWS Shield Standard automatically protects every AWS resource type in every AWS region against common DDoS attacks. No action is required on your part.

AWS Shield	"Shield support for non-Web Apps
Is Shield supported for non-web applications which are not even using a ELB? Can it be assigned to a VPC with public IP addresses? 
In this case, is there any additional protection does AWS-shield provide over and above the Security-groups/NACL ?"
AWS Shield	"Re: Shield support for non-Web Apps
With AWS Shield Advanced you can now add an Elastic IP Address (EIP) as a protected resource, which allows you to protect Amazon EC2 instances and Network Load Balancers (NLB's). For more information about AWS Shield Advanced for EIP, see our What's New announcement at https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/11/aws-shield-adds-advanced-ddos-protection-for-ec2-and-network-load-balancer/ .

AWS Shield	"AWS Shield Advanced - Multiple Accounts
We've got several accounts all owned by the parent company, there are development, qa, and multiple production environments.  If we sign up for Shield advanced, will this cover only one of the accounts, or can we cover all of them?

Cheers

Keith"
AWS Shield	"Re: AWS Shield Advanced - Multiple Accounts
If your organization has multiple AWS accounts, then you can subscribe multiple AWS Accounts to AWS Shield Advanced. You will pay the monthly fee once as long as the AWS accounts are all under a single consolidated billing, and you own all the AWS accounts and resources in those accounts.

Thanks, Jeff

AWS Shield	"Re: AWS Shield Advanced - Multiple Accounts
Thanks for that - very helpful"
AWS Shield	"What if I've got my clients in my AWS account? Are they protected?
I wonder if I contract Shield Advanced the clients I've got in my AWS account are protected with Shield Advanced too.
I've got a web design company and my clients are in my AWS account so it is easier to manage.
Thanks,"
AWS Shield	"Re: What if I've got my clients in my AWS account? Are they protected?
Hi,

You can enable AWS Shield Advanced for the protection of multiple AWS resources, as long as the subscribing AWS Account holder directly owns and manages the AWS resources. Further, AWS Shield Advanced's monthly fee applies per organization subscribed to AWS Shield Advanced. If your organization has multiple AWS accounts, you will pay the monthly fee once as long as you own all the AWS accounts and resources in that account.

Thanks
Venkat"
