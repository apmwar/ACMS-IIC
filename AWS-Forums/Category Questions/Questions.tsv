Questions	"How to deploy a DAPP/smart contract to an ethereum network?
I've set up an ethereum network using the aws blockchain template and I can access all three output urls. How do I deploy a dapp/smart contract using the EthJsonRpc Url once the network is created? Does anybody have any material with instructions on this?

Edited by: LoonyJudy on May 29, 2018 3:34 AM"
Questions	"Re: How to deploy a DAPP/smart contract to an ethereum network?
Hey there,

I was struggling with this yesterday and I made a small discovery that would make your life a lot easier. 

When you are setting up the Blockchain you have a section called Ethereum options that gives you a set of three addresses that are comma separated to start with. Chuck in your metamask public address and now that address is supplied with a good chunk of ether.

Once it has been created you take the RPC URL and connect to that network through metamask. This might require you to set up the SOCKS proxy on your own network in mac/win (Currently trying to get an API to work through which we can connect with keys). If it is all working well and swell you should now see that your address has the supplied ETH in that network. Mine sure does!

With this setup you can now deploy through remix by using your web injected metamask client. And transfer all the ETH from your account to any other accounts if required. 

Hope this helps a bit."

Questions	"Feasibility of using blockchain technology
Hi

I'm investigating the feasibility of using blockchain technology in a proposed real-estate-rentals web application. Major features of the application are (a) the vetting of tenants based on rental-payment and credit history; and (b) the management of financial transactions between tenants/agents and agents/landlords. My understanding is that blockchain technology is suitable for applications in which there is a lack of a central arbiter of transactions. In a web application such as the rentals one I've described, there will be a central arbiter in the form of the application's business tier and relational database. Whereas blockchain solutions tend to be used in decentralised systems, most web applications are centralised, aren't they?

I have two questions. Is there a case for using blockchain technology in the scenario I've described? If so, what aspects of the application would be suitable, and why would this approach be superior to handling the aspects centrally?

Thanks
Alan"
Questions	"No geth running on Ethereum ECS stack?
Has anybody successfully launched an ECS Ethereum network using the AWS blockchain template?

I've tried multiple times, successfully reached CREATE_COMPLETE for all the templates in the stack, but there's no running Ethereum network, i.e. not geth running. I can open Ethstats (through the bastion host) which shows 0 mined blocks,  the block explorer asks for geth access and the JSON/RPC link gives me a 503 - Service Temporarily Unavailable.

Questions	"Ethereum Storage Issues in ECS
I might be missing something but the Blockchain Templates for Ethereum are unusable with public networks at the moment. Geth stores it's data in ~/.ethereum inside the containers. If the node is attached to a public ethereum network like Ropsten or Mainnet, the size of the entire blockchain is 3-6 million blocks. A FAST sync'd geth node (fast is the default) requires about 75GB to be stored in this directory at the moment. Of course the container doesn't have this much storage and fills up pretty quickly. My nodes have only been able to reach 150,000-400,000 blocks before they stall.

I'm wondering why the template doesn't include an EFS mount and ECS volumes for storage? It seems like the template in it's current state is not able to sync with a public ethereum network. It also seems like using EFS could potentially have the benefit of being able to bootstrap autoscaled nodes so they don't have to go through the time consuming initial sync.

I'm happy to fork the Blockchain Templates for Ethereum to attempt to add this EFS mount, but it seems like that would involve manually downloading all the templates from S3 and manually merging them to my fork as they are updated, which isn't ideal. Would love if these templates were published to GitHub."
Questions	"Re: Ethereum Storage Issues in ECS
The whole purpose of this is to run your private node and maintain your own network. Not to download or connect with the testnet or mainnet"

I don't see why these templates couldn't be used to run public nodes if the storage issue was resolved. I think that's a pretty common use case. Private networks aren't very useful."

Questions	"How to deploy a DAPP/smart contract to an ethereum network?
I've set up an ethereum network using the aws blockchain template and I can access all three output urls. How do I deploy a dapp/smart contract using the EthJsonRpc Url once the network is created? Does anybody have any material with instructions on this?

Questions	"Re: How to deploy a DAPP/smart contract to an ethereum network?
Hey there,

I was struggling with this yesterday and I made a small discovery that would make your life a lot easier. 

When you are setting up the Blockchain you have a section called Ethereum options that gives you a set of three addresses that are comma separated to start with. Chuck in your metamask public address and now that address is supplied with a good chunk of ether.

Once it has been created you take the RPC URL and connect to that network through metamask. This might require you to set up the SOCKS proxy on your own network in mac/win (Currently trying to get an API to work through which we can connect with keys). If it is all working well and swell you should now see that your address has the supplied ETH in that network. Mine sure does!

With this setup you can now deploy through remix by using your web injected metamask client. And transfer all the ETH from your account to any other accounts if required. 

Hope this helps a bit."

Questions	"Feasibility of using blockchain technology
Hi

I'm investigating the feasibility of using blockchain technology in a proposed real-estate-rentals web application. Major features of the application are (a) the vetting of tenants based on rental-payment and credit history; and (b) the management of financial transactions between tenants/agents and agents/landlords. My understanding is that blockchain technology is suitable for applications in which there is a lack of a central arbiter of transactions. In a web application such as the rentals one I've described, there will be a central arbiter in the form of the application's business tier and relational database. Whereas blockchain solutions tend to be used in decentralised systems, most web applications are centralised, aren't they?

I have two questions. Is there a case for using blockchain technology in the scenario I've described? If so, what aspects of the application would be suitable, and why would this approach be superior to handling the aspects centrally?

Thanks
Alan"
Questions	"No geth running on Ethereum ECS stack?
Has anybody successfully launched an ECS Ethereum network using the AWS blockchain template?

I've tried multiple times, successfully reached CREATE_COMPLETE for all the templates in the stack, but there's no running Ethereum network, i.e. not geth running. I can open Ethstats (through the bastion host) which shows 0 mined blocks,  the block explorer asks for geth access and the JSON/RPC link gives me a 503 - Service Temporarily Unavailable.

Questions	"Ethereum Storage Issues in ECS
I might be missing something but the Blockchain Templates for Ethereum are unusable with public networks at the moment. Geth stores it's data in ~/.ethereum inside the containers. If the node is attached to a public ethereum network like Ropsten or Mainnet, the size of the entire blockchain is 3-6 million blocks. A FAST sync'd geth node (fast is the default) requires about 75GB to be stored in this directory at the moment. Of course the container doesn't have this much storage and fills up pretty quickly. My nodes have only been able to reach 150,000-400,000 blocks before they stall.

I'm wondering why the template doesn't include an EFS mount and ECS volumes for storage? It seems like the template in it's current state is not able to sync with a public ethereum network. It also seems like using EFS could potentially have the benefit of being able to bootstrap autoscaled nodes so they don't have to go through the time consuming initial sync.

I'm happy to fork the Blockchain Templates for Ethereum to attempt to add this EFS mount, but it seems like that would involve manually downloading all the templates from S3 and manually merging them to my fork as they are updated, which isn't ideal. Would love if these templates were published to GitHub."
Questions	"Re: Ethereum Storage Issues in ECS
The whole purpose of this is to run your private node and maintain your own network. Not to download or connect with the testnet or mainnet"

Hi all,

I'm sorry for any trouble you may have experienced with your Amazon Web Services accounts. 

If your phone number is not verified, you will not be able to sign up for most of the services. This is one of the steps in fully activating your services.  You can request an automated phone verification call here:

https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?redirect_url=https://aws.amazon.com...

Enter the phone number you’d like to be associated with your account, and we'll call you with a PIN number. Enter the PIN number using your phone's keypad when prompted. Once verified, your services will activate within 24 hours.

If you don't receive the verification call, we're happy to manually verify your phone number. You can create a support case using the link below:

https://aws.amazon.com/support/createCase

Select the ""Phone"" option and enter your phone number. We'll call you back as soon as possible.

When you sign up for a new AWS service, the process of validating your credit card information and activating your account can take up to 24 hours in some cases. Once we have verified your account details, you will receive e-mail confirmation that your service has been activated and you should have immediate access to the service.

Questions	"Issue with Quicksight reading S3 data
Hi,

I am trying to add a new data set in Quicksight from S3. The file in S3 is a text file with space separating the columns.

What delimiter I need to specify in the manifest file for Quicksight to understand the columns correctly? I tried delimiter = "" "", but it does not show any data in preview and 0% success when I try to visualize. When I try deliminer=""\t"", it does read the all the lines, but each row is read as one whole string rather than separate values. I have pasted couple of lines from the text file below.

Any suggestions how to read this correctly in Quicksight?

Questions	"Frontend time out Load balancer
Hi,

Recently moved to AWS for my hosting needs, and have set up my instances, route53 and load balancers. I received my SSL Cert from the certificate manager and assigned it to my Load Balancer.

Regarding the service provided, there can be no activity for a while(it depends on each situation, sometimes for 1-3 hours). However, based on the manual provided, 4000sec about 1hour 5min is a max idle time I can set. Which means that have to log in at every 1 hour. It would be so annoying. 
are there any solutions to figure out?

Questions	"Re: How to apply for AWS startup programs such as AWS Activate?
We would love to know the answer to this too! As I understand it, access to the higher levels of AWS Activate is only via an incubator programme and the ""Programme Director"" in the text you quote is the programme director of the incubator that you have joined. In our case, we don't need the funding that goes with an incubator - or the costs either. We have been on the AWS Activate Builder's Programme and that has been extremely useful, but we will soon run out of credit on it. We would really like to get onto the AWS Activate Portfolio programme to support us throughout the final stages of our prototyping and product launch, but we don't want to join an incubator which is going to tie our hands."
Questions	"ElasticBeanstalk/Docker instance hangs on container boot
Hi there,

I have a container that uses the passenger-docker image for my Rails app. Only 'nonstandard' thing is an additional service script added to the container to start Sidekiq. Everything works fine locally, container will build and start without issues -- but on ElasticBeanstalk once the container starts for 30 seconds I lose the ability to even ssh into the instance. I can log on but ssh just hangs. I can't do anything without terminating the EC2 instance and waiting for another to spin up. No logs. Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

How can I even go about fixing this?

After discussing with the aws architect it appears the role settings are correct:
AWSS3ReadOnly
AWSGlueFullControl
AWSAthenaFullControl

Assigning trust of the Redshift user account to the role was done correctly.

Adding the role to the AWS Cluster was done correctly.

The copy command was the only thing done incorrectly. 

The trick is that the S3 bucket path must point to a folder containing the .parquet file, not the file itself.  Any file found in the folder is assumed to be uploaded as a parquet file.

Questions	"Testing performance of AWS big data systems
I  am keen to know about testing performance of AWS big data system .

As per AWS documents , there are 4 stages of the bigdata processing.

•	Ingest (Amazon Kinesis/batch job inputs)
•	Store (Amazon S3/Amazon Glacier/RDS)
•	Process (Amazon EMR/Redshift)
•	Visualize (some third party tool)

In general, I understand that this could be tested by measuring memory utilization, data throughput and processing time in each stage.

I am just wondering how we can test each component's at each stage.. Does Amazon provide required measurements/logs for each component? or do we require to configure third party monitoring tools such as New Relic? 

Also, I am keen to know how we can test below.

•	Real time feeds in ingest phase. i.e Kinesis.. Can we expect AWS components are performing well? Or if we really need to know how it performs, how we can get required performance measurements?
•	Visualization tool performance 'cos I understand that graphs in visualization tool cannot be tested using automation scripts. What could be the best approach for this? How does analytic tools work? Is it directly getting data from data ware houses? or does it maintain a local database? I am just considering general scenarios only.

In addition to that, I would like to know if it is required to do failover test, can we consider AWS components out of scope considering the fact that those are highly available? Can we bring down Kinesis to test real time feeds/ Can we bring down S3 bucket/Redshift to test data storing capability?"

However, when it proceeds to the second view, my debug session says:

connection status = 1
Connecting...
connection status = 3
Disconnected
I copied my code from the second view over into a new project without a table view (just AppDelegate and ViewController) and a thingName hard coded. It works perfectly. My original project signup/signin using AWSMobileClient. (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-mobile/latest/developerguide/add-aws-mobile-user-sign-in.html) Removing that makes no difference on the original project, nor does adding it to the new project. I also tried hardcoding the thingName.

I'm still a little new to iOS and AWS development, so help will be greatly appreciated.

Questions	"Billing alerts
Hi all,

Setting up billing alert leaves me with a little uncertainty. I am using a instance started in Oregon. When I try to set up billing alerts somehow I'm defaulted to N. Virginia. I get this message (see screen shot). Now if I select N.Virginia and then select EC2 instances I see none. If I select Oregon then I see my instance. I am concerned if I set my billing alert in N.Virginia, it will not track billing for my Oregon instance. However I cannot select a different region, then add a billing alert."
Questions	"Re: Billing alerts
Billing alerts are always configured in the US East (N. Virginia) region, but the data reported there cover all regions. In other words, your activity in the Oregon region will be reflected in the billing metrics in N. Virginia."
Questions	"Re: Billing alerts
This answer is completely unsatisfactory. 
I signed up for the Free 12 month trial service.
There are an insane number of services all included in the consolidated billing.
If I were an enterprise (I was a financial analyst for a multi-billion dollar international insurance company for several years), I would be shocked and confused.
With my simple billing, I get ""previews"" of billing, with the disclaimer that the actual invoice will have the final correct billing.
The billing is always off by a couple of percentage points.
Why such complicated confusion?"

Questions	"Frequent Intermittent issue of disconnection on AWS
Is there any such thing like, at a given time, AWS will allow only a few simultaneous connections from a given network? Because, when our site is down at the office(where many people access the site at the same time), I can access it from another network (i.e., my home network). And later, after some time, it is functioning normally at the office as well. This is occurring very frequently these days. If this is the case, are there any services or something like increasing quota which allows more number of simultaneous connections?
We used Elastic IP and later removed it(thinking that Elastic IP could be a problem). We are using a medium instance and the storage is almost double than what we actually use. But the disconnection issue still persists. It says, 'Site cannot be reached' when we try to access our site.

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated."
Questions	"Re: Frequent Intermittent issue of disconnection on AWS
apt purge fail2ban

By running the above command, we managed to solve the issue. fail2ban is preventing many connections from a LAN network at given time thinking that it could be a brute-force attack.

Questions	"Redshift Spectrum scale-out pattern
We are evaluating Redshift Spectrum against one of our data set. We observe some behavior that we don't understand.

We look at different amount of Partitions, all data files are Parquet snappy compressed.

Each day is a partition, and each partition has about 250 Parquet files and each file has roughly the same size. Across 365 days, each file per day ranges from 350MB to 500MB.

When we evaluate just 1 day/partition, our two Redshift cluster (A: 14 nodes ds2.8xlarge configuration performs about the same. B: 5 nodes dc2.8xlarge)

When we evaluate 30 days/partitions, both clusters performs about the same.

When we evaluate 365 days/partitions, cluster A with 14 nodes out-performed cluster B with 5 nodes by 3x.

The query plan shows the following:

 XN HashAggregate  (cost=300017018.00..300017018.50 rows=200 width=524)
   ->  XN Partition Loop  (cost=300000000.00..300012018.00 rows=1000000 width=524)
         ->  XN Seq Scan PartitionInfo of REDACTED  (cost=0.00..15.00 rows=5 width=0)
               Filter: (((dt)::text <= '2018-01-01 00:00:00'::text) AND ((dt)::text >= '2017-01-01 00:00:00'::text))
         ->  XN S3 Query Scan s  (cost=150000000.00..150002000.50 rows=200000 width=524)

Hi,
I have an app developed on Unity and I want to use AWS as backend and database where:

Users should be able to log-in to the app and play.

1. Set a login system
2. Saving information on our relational database. Only authenticated user can save data and we need to protect the information of our users using SSL to guarantee the security of the data transferred.
