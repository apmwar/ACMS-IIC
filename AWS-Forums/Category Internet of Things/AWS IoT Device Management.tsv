AWS IoT Device Management	"AWS Shield as a DDoS Service?
Hi,

We are currently hosting some of our services on AWS, and some of our infrastructure on other places.
For one of our servers hosted elsewhere (serving raw TCP traffic, not HTTP/S), we would like to be able to benefit from AWS shield standard protection.
Does AWS Shield Standard protection apply to non-HTTP ports of EC2 instances?
Does it make sense to create an EC2 instance and put a reverse TCP proxy on it? Assuming 2TB of traffic per month, what setup / costs should we be looking at?

AWS IoT Device Management	"Shield Standard:  What does it protect
The FAQ and Info online aren't too clear about what services Shield Standard actually protect; I see mention of load balancers, etc. but little specifics.

I'm specifically interested in knowing if Shield Standard protects Elastic IPs allocated in VPCs, and what types of protection are in place (Protection against SYN floods, UDP Floods, ICMP Floods, etc.).

Is there more detailed info available?"
AWS IoT Device Management	"Re: Shield Standard:  What does it protect
AWS Shield Standard defends against most common, frequently occurring network and transport layer DDoS attacks that target your web site or applications. On Amazon EC2, your traffic levels are inspected by an auto-mitigation system that can engage when a well-defined DDoS attack signature is detected or at high levels of traffic, given your choice of instance type. UDP reflection attacks, like DNS reflection, NTP reflection, SSDP reflection, etc. are examples of common DDoS attack vectors that can be mitigated by this system.

For improved DDoS resilience across a wide range of attack vectors, like SYN floods or web application layer attacks, consider using Amazon CloudFront or Application Load Balancer (ALB) with AWS WAF. You can also use a Classic Load Balancer for non-web use cases and Amazon Route 53 to also protect against DNS query floods.

You can learn more about these recommendations in the AWS Best Practices for DDoS Resiliency which is available at https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/Security/DDoS_White_Paper.pdf . This paper provides a prescriptive reference architecture you can use to help make your applications more DDoS resilient.

I will reach out to you directly to answer any follow-up questions you might have. I am interested to learn about your application and provide tailored recommendations.

Hello Jeffrey and other AWS employees,

Can AWS Shield Standard prevent a volumetric attack from saturating the bandwidth of a small EC2 instance and what will happen if a UDP attack hits a small instance while all UDP is blocked in the security group? Will you ever nullroute the IP, if a huge attack hits us? Layer 7 is not an issue since we'll have efficient rate limits.

AWS IoT Device Management	"TOTP on transaction validation
Hi community!

I searched through the Cognito docs and haven't found the answer to my problem.

Some transactions in my company system need to be confirmed by a token, because those transactions may lead to incorrect invoices and hence some major tax problems to be dealt later. We're still on architecture definition, and some AWS solutions need to be selected to plan our monthly budget and our development sprints.

After some research, I figured out that Cognito sends TOTP tokens when MFA is turned on, but apparently that's done only on login. I couldn't figure out however if Cognito can be used to send those TOTP tokens for other purposes, like the one described above. Is there a way to to that using this or any other AWS service, or is it better to develop a service compliant to RFC 6238?

I'd like to thank the help of you all in advance.

Best regards,
Guilherme Soares."

AWS IoT Device Management	"Logout not working for federated OIDC provider (OP)
Signing out using the following method, as per the logout endpoint document, only removes the first user pool's sign-in cookie and not the federated OP. This is an incorrect implementation and would leave a false sense of signing out.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/logout-endpoint.html
GET https:{domain}.auth.{region}.amazoncognito.com/logout?logout_uri={uri}&client_id={clientid}
Only deletes the sign-in cookie for that domain
Then redirects based on the logout_uri.

A workaround is for the RP to also know about the end_session_endpoint for the federated OP. This is not ideal.

The implementation should have the user pool using the OP iframe to logout method to sign out of any federated OPs and then perform the logout on the identity pool. IdentityServer3 & 4 have done the same in their implementation.

AWS IoT Device Management	"Re: Logout not working for federated OIDC provider (OP)
I would highly recommend and strongly encourage that AWS implement some form of federated signout capability regardless of the state of the standard, before people face issues thinking they've signout but haven't if they're using 3rd party OPs.

The session management, front and back channel specifications are in implementer's draft status rather, rather than solely draft status. There are many other identity provider implementations following the implementer's draft (e.g. ADFS, IdentityServer3 & 4, Auth0, WSO2, etc.).

We have a use case for this as well. We are using an instance of IdentityServer as an identity provider with Cognito and need federated logout. We are manually going to implement it via a laundry list of SignOutUrls in each AppClient configuration, which is less than ideal.

Our IdentityServer instance is the lone identity provider with our Cognito instance, so we are able to redirect to the IdentityServer logout instance. This is NOT the long-term plan, though. We do see the need for multiple identity providers in the near future."

AWS IoT Device Management	"[Unity3D] Is there an economic way to grant app access to AWS services?
Hi,

Im pretty confused with some things. Im developing a game in Unity3D, and I want to use DynamoDB and S3 for players storage data.

I have in mind this two basic scenarios:

First scenario:

1) Players will authenticate with social platforms (Facebook, Google) using each platform SDK. If they login, they get an accessToken from the platform. Fine here.
2) Next, grant access to AWS by doing each player pass the accessToken credentials.AddLogin(""graph.facebook.com"", accessToken) in the AWS SDK;
3) Player can start using AWS services, DynamoDB, S3.

In this scenario, I will have one MAU for each player that login in the month. 10.000.000 unique logins in a month = 10.000.000 MAU = 10.000.000 * price of the MAU.

Second scenario (if possible)

1) Player will authenticate with social platforms (Facebook, Google) using each platform SDK.
2) App authenticate with Identity Pool ID in order to have access to AWS services.
3) Player can start using AWS services, DynamoDB, S3.

In this scenario, I can have infinite numbers of logins each month, but the MAU will be always 1 since its always the same for each player.

The questions are:
1) Is this 2 scenario possible?
2) Is possible to have an app with 10.000.000 users per month that let players use AWS services (DynamoDB, S3) without paying 10.000.000 MAU prices (at least paying for 1 MAU).

AWS IoT Device Management	"Facebook display=popup
I've got a cognito user pool set up with facebook federated identity provider.
And everything works perfectly, from a technical angle.

However, my users think it looks ugly.

Here's why:

Cognito redirects the users to https://www.facebook.com/v2.9/dialog/oauth to do their sign-in.
However, that link loads up their whole facebook menu bar complete with friend requests and notifications in the background.

Fortunately, facebook provides an alternate link for signin, which is https://www.facebook.com/v2.9/dialog/oauth?display=popup (it's mostly the same, just has display=popup at the end).  That link provides a proper authentication screen without all the background stuff, and it's even more compact, which is more suitable for the size of my website window.

Unfortunately, I can't see how to configure Cognito to including this display=popup parameter in the URL it sends users to.

AWS IoT Device Management	"Re: Change background outside of the User Pool App?
Hello,

As mentioned above, currently, changing the background outside the modal is not supported for Hosted UI. The list of modifications that you can currently perform are mentioned in the below documentation:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-app-ui-customization.html

You can also create your own custom UI and use AWS Amplify to implement Cognito Authentication:

https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/js/authentication

However, I would like to inform you that, the Cognito team is currently working on it as many customers have requested this. Thank you for the feedback. Once the feature is released, you will be able to perform many modifications on the Hosted UI design and feel but, unfortunately, we will not be able to provide an estimated time for the release.

Hi!
I'm using Cognito UserPools with the Javascript SDK to signup and authenticate users. Everything works fine, I'm able to signup, login and receive JWT tokens.

This is the expected behavior of our client SDKs. It adds the tokens to local storage so user can use the app without logging in again after the session is closed and then restarted.

These tokens are Base64 encoded JWT tokens and are not clear text. See this guide for more details about our tokens.

If you do not wish these tokens to be stored in local storage, you can call the clearCachedTokens method on a user object whenever you want. If you do this, user will have to login again for any user action that requires him to be signed in after this."

We're trying to use a custom domain name for a cognito user pool. However due to us having other cloudfront configurations for that domain, cognito fails to create the custom domain name because we have *.ourdomain.com defined in another cloudfront distro.

I've setup our own cloudfront distro to point at our cognito url, but it does not work properly, it looks like there are XSS errors when the cognito login page is trying to access it's own resources via a different cloudfront distro.

AWS IoT Device Management	"Cognito User Pools: Preferred Username Alias Restrictions & Uniqueness
Hi,

I've been testing a Cognito User Pool that uses preferred_username as a login alias. I've noticed some interesting behaviors and I want to clarify the rules regarding usernames and preferred usernames.

First, I understand that regular usernames are required to be unique. However, I've also noticed it seems like preferred_usernames must be unique as well (a change from the OpenID Connect spec) at least when used as aliases. Further, I've noticed that many (all?) of the User Pool APIs seem to accept both username and preferred_username where a username is required. And finally, I've noticed that usernames and preferred usernames don't seem to be allowed to overlap – the ""uniqueness pool"" seems to encompass both username and preferred_username.

So my questions are, when preferred_username is enabled as an alias:

1. do preferred usernames need to be unique?
2. do preferred usernames need to be unique with regard to regular usernames as well?
3. do all User Pool APIs that ask for a username also accept a preferred username alias?
4. is this behavior documented somewhere I've missed?
5. can I count on these behaviors remaining stable?

Hello,

Thanks for the reply.  I understand what you are saying and I would never write code against a particular response message as it could potentially change at any time.  My point was that the specific message you are returning in this case leaks information that could be considered a security risk.  Specifically, it would let an attacker know that they have found a valid username because they will start getting a different message back which indicates the account exists but they just have the wrong password.  The industry standard approach seems to be to return something like ""Incorrect username or password"" in all cases so the user (attacker) never knows if they have found an actual account.

Also, I do understand that I could look at the individual codes and build my own messages, I just think it is common practice to use the human-readable messages that the server returns as-is.  This isn't a huge deal, just something I thought I should point out."

It should also give no indication to the status of an existing account."". It greatly surprised me to read that AWS chose to compromise security ""at the request of users"". AWS Cognito presents itself as a ""Simple and Secure User Sign Up & Sign In"", and as such it should implement all industry best-practices.

AWS IoT Device Management	"IdP initiated auth with Okta
Hi,

I've setup a Cognito user pool with a federation to a test Okta environment. This all works perfectly well with an SP initiated authentication flow, i.e. redirecting to https://myapp.auth.eu-west-1.amazoncognito.com/login?response_type=token&client_id=xxxx ....

However it doesn't work when I try to initiate the flow directly from Okta i.e. https://myapp.okta.com/app/poc/xxx/sso/saml

Okta offers an 'application dashboard' where users can access applications. Each application link uses  IdP initiated approach. When trying to access my app in this way, I get prompted to login to Okta and then an error from a Cognito page: ""Invalid samlResponse or relayState from identity provider"".

I've a suspicion the answer lies in the ""default relay state"" option that Okta offers, as if Cognito needs some additional context such as user pool ID, client ID etc to successfully authenticate. If I try specifying a URL as the relay state, I get a blank error on the aforementioned Cognito page.

Having examined the redirect Cognito builds when redirecting to Okta in a SP-initiated flow, it is absolutely passing on a RelayState. This seems to be a twice (?) base64 encoded JSON string. Decoding this yields an object:

{""userPoolId"":""eu-west-1_XXX"",""providerName"":""Okta"",""clientId"":""XX"",""redirectURI"":""https://localhost:5000/auth"",""responseType"":""token"",""providerType"":""SAML"",""scopes"":,""state"":null,""codeChallenge"":null,""codeChallengeMethod"":null,""serverHostPort"":""myapp.auth.eu-west-1.amazoncognito.com"",""creationTimeSeconds"":1513799357}

This might be the context I need in an IdP flow.

So, I guess my question is: is what I'm trying to do supported? If so, is it just a case of ensuring the relay state is set correctly? Or have I entirely misunderstood?

Under the ""Parameters"" table I also included the following parameters (mapping below is ""SAML Test Connector Field"" : ""Value""). These need to be included in the SAML Response and mapped to the Cognito User (under Attribute mapping part of Step 2 in the blog post above):

FirstName: First Name
LastName: Last Name


This now works seamlessly using either the hosted Cognito UI or straight from OneLogin.

AWS IoT Device Management	"User Pool Backups?
I have noticed that there is no facility to get a backup from a user pool, this is quite needed for a production environment, any idea on when this would be available? I know there is an export facility but this has some shortcoming:

1) sub changes from between export/import making them unusable as user id (I now use the username instead)
2) federated identity token and information are not exported
3) the experience is not as simple as recovering a snapshot like in RDS
4) groups and groups relationships are not exported

AWS IoT Device Management	"TooManyRequestsException: Rate exceeded - Cognito API Limits
We are trying to test our applications performance by signing in many users at once and performing operations with those users with the APIs that we have created in the API Gateway. So at the moment this is all at the API level with no UI involved. We are running into TooManyRequestsException: Rate exceeded errors though due to the default limits for the Cognito APIs specifically the user authentication operations that come with the AWS .NET SDK, which appear to have a limit of 10 to 20 requests/second depending on the API(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/limits.html).  For reference, our authentication process exactly mimics that of the Client Side Authentication flow here https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-authentication-flow.html. If the authentication tokens have expired we make a call to the InitiateAuth API again with the REFRESH_TOKEN to get new tokens. The specific error we see are seeing is...

Amazon.CognitoIdentityProvider.Model.TooManyRequestsException: Rate exceeded ---> Amazon.Runtime.Internal.HttpErrorResponseException: The remote server returned an error: (400) Bad Request.

We can work around these limits in our test environment by throttling how many users we are signing in at once, but we are having trouble understanding why the default rate limits are so low. It is likely that many users may sign in at the same time and/or need updated credentials at a rate higher than what the default limits are.  I understand a service limit increase can be requested, but with such a low starting rate we are starting to question whether or not we missed something or have set up the Cognito authentication process incorrectly. A previous product of ours at a peak time saw up to 750 concurrent session requests, which is what we are attempting to model using load/performance testing to make sure our application is properly handling that load to our expectations. We run our tests all in one account and in one UserPool, which is what our production environment will also look like, at least initially.

My main questions stemming from this are...
Why are the default limits so low? Do these rates actually support most use cases?

What is the best way to handle these Rate exceeded errors in a production environment before going the route of requesting a service limit increase? I assume similar to recommendations I have seen for other AWS services some sort of retry logic would be needed to handle this?

What is a reasonable service limit increase request for the load we are initially trying to support?

AWS IoT Device Management	"Cognito: send verification code to phone_number and email on signup?
Hi,

I am using AWS cognito to manage users. I want to send a verification code to user's phone_number and email on sign up(I am able to send code to phone_number or email, but not to both). I did not find a way to achieve it in cognito.

Please suggest me a way to achieve it.

I appreciate for your time.

AWS IoT Device Management	"Re: Cognito: send verification code to phone_number and email on signup?
Hello Prashanth,

Currently, if a user signs up with both a phone number and an email address, and your user pool settings require verification of both attributes, a verification code is sent via SMS to the phone. The email is not verified and the flow must be implemented in the app.

Your app needs to call GetUser [1] to see if an email address is awaiting verification. If it is, the app should call GetUserAttributeVerificationCode [2] to initiate the email verification flow and then submit the verification code by calling VerifyUserAttribute [3]. This is explained in our public documentation [4] under the notes section. You will be able to send the code to emails using this set up. 

Hope this helps. Let us know if you have any further queries.

Hello,

The list of modifications that you can currently perform on Hosted UI are mentioned in the below documentation:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-app-ui-customization.html

You can also create your own custom UI and use AWS Amplify to implement Cognito Authentication:

https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/js/authentication

However, as mentioned above, I would like to inform you that, the Cognito team is currently working on it as many customers have requested this. Thank you for the feedback. Once the feature is released, you will be able to perform many modifications on the Hosted UI design and feel but, unfortunately, we will not be able to provide an estimated time for the release. 

Kindly, check our products announcement page [1] and AWS Blog [2] periodically for updates.

AWS IoT Device Management	"Re: Cognito jwt token fails verification every time
I’m having the same problem. How are you getting your token? Through the browser with the Cognito login link?

I’m calling the /login Cognito API endpoint in Chrome to obtain a token, with response_type
 set to token
 - this returns an ID token, and I wonder if that’s the problem. Will the Cognito Authorizer test respond positively only to an access token? If so, how can I obtain the Access token from the /login endpoint?

I have also tried using the ID token in the Authorization header via Postman, but it also returns unauthorised.

For clarity, I am copying and pasting the token from the callback url, where it shows #id-token
.

Perhaps I’m missing something else... do I need to allocate the users in my pool to a group with an appropriate IAM role (i.e. to allow API gateway calls) before the test will pass?"

When Amplify authenticates on account A and tries to access this bucket on account B, it gets an Access Denied (403).

Probably it's missing some configuration on account A and/or account B.

Could you help me, please?

Hi everyone,

My question regards the best practices around this and also how best to go about implementing such a system. I've taken a look at the following articles
1. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html
2. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-import-using-lambda.html

I am currently building a lambda function to seamlessly migrate users from one cognito user pool to another across different aws accounts. This adds an extra layer of complexity as to how the lambda function will assume a role or securely access user details from a user pool in a different aws account entirely.

My current thoughts are to create IAM role on both AWS accounts and have my lambda function assume whatever is required to access the user details. Another puzzle I have is enabling boto assume these roles across accounts and bring the results back to the current account. It's a problem my team and I trying to figure. Will like to hear thoughts on this, with special emphasis on security.

AWS IoT Device Management	"Post Confirmation Lambda Trigger after Admin Create
Hi,

I currently have a Cognito Pool that should trigger a Lambda Post Confirmation trigger after a User is confirmed. However, I am never seeing the Post Confirmation trigger event be invoked after a User is confirmed.

I believe my process of setting up a user might be the cause of this:

1. Use adminCreateUser to build the new user.
2. Use adminInitiateAuth to login the user for the first time and get the NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED challenge.
3. Use adminRespondToAuthChallenge to respond and set the user's password so we bypass the need to have the user reset the password.

I am able to successfully create the user and login via this route. I see the user get to a confirmation status as well.

However, I never see a Post Confirmation event in the Lambda. I tested to make sure my Lambda was working by setting it for PreSignUp and PostAuthentication. Both of those triggered fine.

I also attempted with the standard flow of:
1. Create user as admin.
2. Get password temp for user to login via email.
3. Login for user with temp password and set new password.
4. See user get confirmed.

In that instance, no Post Confirmation event is recorded in Lambda either.

Any help or ideas I can try would be greatly appreciated."
AWS IoT Device Management	"Re: Post Confirmation Lambda Trigger after Admin Create
The Cognito User Pools service does not invoke Post Confirmation trigger in this case. Since setting the password after first sign in attempt is an authentication attempt, successful authentication and setting the password triggers Post Authentication trigger.

We understand the confusion of user status being changed from FORCE_CHANGE_PASSWORD to CONFIRMED and why customers would expect Post Confirmation trigger to be invoked. We are considering the options to elevate this confusion and will post the update here."
AWS IoT Device Management	"Re: Post Confirmation Lambda Trigger after Admin Create
Any update?
I/we do not allow users to sign themselves up. An admin will always create the users record, and send an email with a temp password.

How do I trigger an event, after the email has been verified, or after the user sets required attributes?"
AWS IoT Device Management	"Re: Post Confirmation Lambda Trigger after Admin Create
Hi,

I had this same issue. For a workaround, I set a trigger on the POST_AUTHENTICATION hook and then tested for the UserStatus of ""FORCE_CHANGE_PASSWORD"". If a user doesn't actually set a new password and leaves the site beforehand, this will be a false positive, but it worked for us in our use case.

def handler(event, _):
    ''' handle post auth event '''

    # If the status hasn't been confirmed yet, we can assume it now is

The only clue I have is that the default Cognito user pool limit has been increased to 1000 according to the docs, yet my 'create user pool' requests were being denied, citing the old default limit of 100. Both of these number ignored the fact that i had previously requested and received an increase to my limit.

Such is the way with Cognito, it seems... Things break, a week goes by, then a few more days, and then, if you're lucky, they unbreak. No explanation given.

You can use a Custom Message lambda trigger and just use it to call SES and bypass cognito."

I'd like to add my +1 to this as well.

While I understand that a workaround can be implemented, this would be probably the 10th or 11th Cognito workaround we've had to implement to get past design or implementation flaws in AWS. It seems every week, I'm writing to AWS support about an issue, and they'll respond by confirming that I've raised a valid problem, and it's going to be flagged to the engineering team, but there's no ETA on when it will be fixed. 

It's a bit ridiculous. I'm happy with AWS overall, but feeling a little fatigue from developing on this platform."
AWS IoT Device Management	"Re: Cognito Email Messages - Specify Sender Name?
Does the workaround using Lambda and calling SES directly work, though? I believe the confirmation codes are replaced by the Cognito service itself and are not available in the Lambda. Meaning, when I get a custom message Lambda trigger I receive the following JSON blob:

{
   ""version"": ""1"",
   ""region"": ""us-east-1""
   ""triggerSource"": ""CustomMessage_ForgotPassword"",
   ""request"": {
      ""userAttributes"": {
         ""sub"": ""<UUID>"",
         ""email_verified"": ""true"",
         ""cognito:user_status"": ""RESET_REQUIRED"",
         ""email"": ""hi@acme.com""
      },
      ""codeParameter"": ""{####}"",
      ""linkParameter"": ""{##Click Here##}"",
      ""usernameParameter"": null
   },
   ""response"": {
      ""smsMessage"": null,
      ""emailMessage"": null,
      ""emailSubject"": null
   }
}


That is, the codeParameter value is literally {####} and then Cognito service replaces that. I don't see how we can send custom messages if that value isn't exposed.

Additionally, I'm not sure we can stop Cognito from sending an email for the forgot password event. This means using a Lambda for the CustomMessage_ForgotPassword event results in 2 emails: one from SES directly and one from Cognito.

AWS IoT Device Management	"Unable to log in first-time Cognito user pool users after a recent change
Hi Team,

I've used adminLinkProviderForUser for Cognito User Pools in a pre-signup trigger to automatically link user identities from external providers to an existing identity in the pool upon first sign-in. However, due to what appears to be a recent change on AWS side, this no longer works with App Integration. Instead, upon a successful sign-up and linking in the trigger, the user gets redirected to to the login page with the error message ""Already found an entry for username"". This behavior was not there when I first programmed the trigger.

Is there any way to work around this problem, or do we have to tell users to log in twice (once for the initial sign-up, then again for the actual login)?

In fact, adminLinkProviderForUser is a paradox now: it cannot be used to link an existing identity ( after a sign-up), but using it before that (in a pre-signup trigger) leads to the aforementioned error message.  

Thank you

AWS IoT Device Management	"Re: Unable to log in first-time Cognito user pool users after a recent change
Denvlad, thanks for your work on this. I am encountering the same issue but have some interesting test cases to add.

I have a lambda function that executes on the Cognito Presignup trigger and will link a new external identity to an existing one if they already have a Cognito identity with the same email address. If I deploy the lambda function, create a new Cognito Pool user and then sign in using an external provider, my user and identity are successfully linked but I receive a ""PreSignUp failed with error SourceUser with the specified attribute value is already linked to another user"". Signing in again using the external provider works as expected (I get the user identity that already existed and everything is fine).

If I then try and add a second new external identity it fails with a ""Already found an entry for username <userid>"", but this time it really does fail and my external identity is added as a new user in Cognito. Adding an external provider identity also fails for a completely different user and email address in the same way.

If I redeploy my lambda function again, I can link just one external provider (albeit with an initial error message), and subsequent attempts fail. Given that the initial use of my lambda function is much slower than subsequent uses, I wonder whether there is some RACE condition involved.

AWS IoT Device Management	"Re: Unable to log in first-time Cognito user pool users after a recent change
I'm not sure about Java code, but here's my sample in TypeScript which is a bit shorter so easier to glance what's going on: https://github.com/cumulous/backend/blob/1a1438e167ebebeaa5e1477636d9b2cf8ed4c267/src/cognito.ts#L364-L388

EDIT: I did test linking a second external identity with my code, and it has the same behavior as the first (i.e. an ""Already found an entry for username"" response after a successful linking in pre-signup, then a successful login after a second auth attempt). So it's likely an issue on your side.

EDIT2: I think you may be linking the second external user to the first external user instead of to the Cognito user. Make sure to filter your listUsers response by the type of provider (see my function getUserByAttribute as an example). After successful linking of both externals, I have 1 Cognito user with CONFIRMED status and 2(!) users with EXTERNAL_PROVIDER status, all with the same email. I was also told by the support that this behavior is intentional. So filter out all users with EXTERNAL_PROVIDER status and take the remaining one (which may or may not be CONFIRMED, depending on its email verification status etc; you may need to check for that separately, as I also do in the code).

The support hasn't been able to resolve the initial issue yet though.

AWS IoT Device Management	"Re: Unable to log in first-time Cognito user pool users after a recent change
Thanks for the tip and sharing your code.
The AdminLinkProviderForUser function only take two arguments; ProviderAttributeValue and ProviderName. On both occassions (for linking 2 external identities) I pass the same details for my Cognito user. I added some extra debug for user status and enabled, and that all looks fine too.
The error message seems to indicate that the second user already exists by the time I try and link them.
Perhaps there is some additional problem with the Java SDK.

AWS IoT Device Management	"Re: Unable to log in first-time Cognito user pool users after a recent change
No, the AWS support was able to replicate the issue but they don't have a fix yet, and no timelines on a fix per their usual policy.

As a side note, we're actually moving to Firebase that better fits our use case and my new workplace's preferred provider (Google). I do hope that Cognito User Pools Auth succeeds though, it is a very convenient platform that integrates nicely with AWS.

AWS IoT Device Management	"Re: Unable to log in first-time Cognito user pool users after a recent change
To be fair, this limitation can (and should) be solved based on email_verified attribute for different providers. Moreover, it used to work for me when Cognito User Auth API was first introduced. But the point of the confusion is that it stopped working without an announcement.

Other platforms (e.g. Firebase and Auth0) thrive on this feature so if Cognito wants to stay competitive this should be a core (must-have) feature IMO. At the least, the decision to auto-link accounts based on some attribute should be deferred to the developer, not disabled blankly by AWS."

AWS IoT Device Management	"Use Cognito to handle user login on RoR app and Serverless site same domain
I am currently in the situation, where I have an existing Ruby on Rails application (Sharetribe open source) running as a marketplace with Devise as login handler.

What I want to do is move all the logic gradually to an implementation using AWS serverless and lambdas.

What I have done so far is set up an API Gateway in AWS where all requests are proxied to the existing RoR-site, and whenever a feature or page is moved to lambdas, the path will be defined in the gateway. This should be working fine, but I have a problem regarding sharing logins and authentication between RoR and Lambdas.

To handle that problem I want to use Cognito as authenticator and session keeper in both parts of the solution, so it will also work when I've moved all the features to Lambdas and are able to turn off the RoR application.

This should be easy enough if I only wanted to use Cognito with username and password and getting the JWT, but I also want to be able to allow people to log in with Facebook and possibly Google or some other social logins.

So my question is this: How would you make a call to Cognito that also allows to log in via Facebook, and store the login for future calls? I don't currently need to be able to grant the users access to other AWS resources, so just utilizing the User Pool of Cognito should be fine if that helps."

Hi,

I'm trying to use Cognito as a leeway to get temporary AWS credentials to access some resources. I combed through the information, it's patchy probably because the main use case are the mobile devices, though JavaScript is officially supported. Still, I believe I found out the proper beginning of the process, which is to:


create the Cognito Identity Pool (will also create authenticated and unauthenticated roles)
run AWS.CognitoIdentityCredentials.get()


This first step is failing, because apparently Cognito AWS endpoints do not respond with CORS headers. It would not be problem for mobile/desktop apps but for in-the-browser this is a show stopper. What to do now?

The rudimentary reproduction case is attached as a file, I removed AWS account ID from that. For that sample to work, you'd have to create the new Identity Pool with default settings in your AWS console and copy/paste region, account id, identity pool id and rolearn from there.

The messages I'm getting in the browser's console look like this:

XMLHttpRequest cannot load https://cognito-identity.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://inncognito.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com' is therefore not allowed access. The response had HTTP status code 404.

AWS IoT Device Management	"Re: Shield Standard:  What does it protect
AWS Shield Standard defends against most common, frequently occurring network and transport layer DDoS attacks that target your web site or applications. On Amazon EC2, your traffic levels are inspected by an auto-mitigation system that can engage when a well-defined DDoS attack signature is detected or at high levels of traffic, given your choice of instance type. UDP reflection attacks, like DNS reflection, NTP reflection, SSDP reflection, etc. are examples of common DDoS attack vectors that can be mitigated by this system.

For improved DDoS resilience across a wide range of attack vectors, like SYN floods or web application layer attacks, consider using Amazon CloudFront or Application Load Balancer (ALB) with AWS WAF. You can also use a Classic Load Balancer for non-web use cases and Amazon Route 53 to also protect against DNS query floods.

You can learn more about these recommendations in the AWS Best Practices for DDoS Resiliency which is available at https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/Security/DDoS_White_Paper.pdf .

AWS IoT Device Management	"TOTP on transaction validation
Hi community!

I searched through the Cognito docs and haven't found the answer to my problem.

Some transactions in my company system need to be confirmed by a token, because those transactions may lead to incorrect invoices and hence some major tax problems to be dealt later. We're still on architecture definition, and some AWS solutions need to be selected to plan our monthly budget and our development sprints.

After some research, I figured out that Cognito sends TOTP tokens when MFA is turned on, but apparently that's done only on login. I couldn't figure out however if Cognito can be used to send those TOTP tokens for other purposes, like the one described above. Is there a way to to that using this or any other AWS service, or is it better to develop a service compliant to RFC 6238?

I'd like to thank the help of you all in advance.

AWS IoT Device Management	"[Unity3D] Is there an economic way to grant app access to AWS services?
Hi,

Im pretty confused with some things. Im developing a game in Unity3D, and I want to use DynamoDB and S3 for players storage data.

I have in mind this two basic scenarios:

First scenario:

1) Players will authenticate with social platforms (Facebook, Google) using each platform SDK. If they login, they get an accessToken from the platform. Fine here.
2) Next, grant access to AWS by doing each player pass the accessToken credentials.AddLogin(""graph.facebook.com"", accessToken) in the AWS SDK;
3) Player can start using AWS services, DynamoDB, S3.

In this scenario, I will have one MAU for each player that login in the month. 10.000.000 unique logins in a month = 10.000.000 MAU = 10.000.000 * price of the MAU.

Second scenario (if possible)

1) Player will authenticate with social platforms (Facebook, Google) using each platform SDK.
2) App authenticate with Identity Pool ID in order to have access to AWS services.
3) Player can start using AWS services, DynamoDB, S3.

In this scenario, I can have infinite numbers of logins each month, but the MAU will be always 1 since its always the same for each player.

The questions are:
1) Is this 2 scenario possible?
2) Is possible to have an app with 10.000.000 users per month that let players use AWS services (DynamoDB, S3) without paying 10.000.000 MAU prices (at least paying for 1 MAU).

I've got a cognito user pool set up with facebook federated identity provider.
And everything works perfectly, from a technical angle.

However, my users think it looks ugly.

Here's why:

Cognito redirects the users to https://www.facebook.com/v2.9/dialog/oauth to do their sign-in.
However, that link loads up their whole facebook menu bar complete with friend requests and notifications in the background.

Fortunately, facebook provides an alternate link for signin, which is https://www.facebook.com/v2.9/dialog/oauth?display=popup (it's mostly the same, just has display=popup at the end).  That link provides a proper authentication screen without all the background stuff, and it's even more compact, which is more suitable for the size of my website window.

Unfortunately, I can't see how to configure Cognito to including this display=popup parameter in the URL it sends users to.

AWS IoT Device Management	"Cognito User Pools: Preferred Username Alias Restrictions & Uniqueness
Hi,

I've been testing a Cognito User Pool that uses preferred_username as a login alias. I've noticed some interesting behaviors and I want to clarify the rules regarding usernames and preferred usernames.

First, I understand that regular usernames are required to be unique. However, I've also noticed it seems like preferred_usernames must be unique as well (a change from the OpenID Connect spec) at least when used as aliases. Further, I've noticed that many (all?) of the User Pool APIs seem to accept both username and preferred_username where a username is required. And finally, I've noticed that usernames and preferred usernames don't seem to be allowed to overlap – the ""uniqueness pool"" seems to encompass both username and preferred_username.

So my questions are, when preferred_username is enabled as an alias:

1. do preferred usernames need to be unique?
2. do preferred usernames need to be unique with regard to regular usernames as well?
3. do all User Pool APIs that ask for a username also accept a preferred username alias?

AWS IoT Device Management	"Re: Cognito User Pools: Preferred Username Alias Restrictions & Uniqueness
I am using email as an alias, with uniqueness constraint. It works fine when somebody tries register with the same email - the system returns an error and the user cannot proceed.

However, I have found out that the constraint can be broken if one uses other identity providers like Facebook or Google.

1. Assume a user registers in cognito with an email user@email.com
2. Then the same user, uses his Facebook account (that also has user@email.com) to register
3. You end up with two accounts with the same alias, user@email.com

Note that, if one tries 2 and then 1, they will get an error, as they should.

I am trying to create a pre-signup lambda trigger to reject a signup request from a social account that an already-registered email. The problem is that you cannot query cognito with aliases. Any ideas?"

AWS IoT Device Management	"TooManyRequestsException: Rate exceeded - Cognito API Limits
We are trying to test our applications performance by signing in many users at once and performing operations with those users with the APIs that we have created in the API Gateway. So at the moment this is all at the API level with no UI involved. We are running into TooManyRequestsException: Rate exceeded errors though due to the default limits for the Cognito APIs specifically the user authentication operations that come with the AWS .NET SDK, which appear to have a limit of 10 to 20 requests/second depending on the API(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/limits.html).  For reference, our authentication process exactly mimics that of the Client Side Authentication flow here https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-authentication-flow.html. If the authentication tokens have expired we make a call to the InitiateAuth API again with the REFRESH_TOKEN to get new tokens. The specific error we see are seeing is...

Amazon.CognitoIdentityProvider.Model.TooManyRequestsException: Rate exceeded ---> Amazon.Runtime.Internal.HttpErrorResponseException: The remote server returned an error: (400) Bad Request.

We can work around these limits in our test environment by throttling how many users we are signing in at once, but we are having trouble understanding why the default rate limits are so low. It is likely that many users may sign in at the same time and/or need updated credentials at a rate higher than what the default limits are.  I understand a service limit increase can be requested, but with such a low starting rate we are starting to question whether or not we missed something or have set up the Cognito authentication process incorrectly. A previous product of ours at a peak time saw up to 750 concurrent session requests, which is what we are attempting to model using load/performance testing to make sure our application is properly handling that load to our expectations. We run our tests all in one account and in one UserPool, which is what our production environment will also look like, at least initially.

My main questions stemming from this are...
Why are the default limits so low? Do these rates actually support most use cases?

What is the best way to handle these Rate exceeded errors in a production environment before going the route of requesting a service limit increase? I assume similar to recommendations I have seen for other AWS services some sort of retry logic would be needed to handle this?

What is a reasonable service limit increase request for the load we are initially trying to support?

AWS IoT Device Management	"Re: Cognito: send verification code to phone_number and email on signup?
Hello Prashanth,

Currently, if a user signs up with both a phone number and an email address, and your user pool settings require verification of both attributes, a verification code is sent via SMS to the phone. The email is not verified and the flow must be implemented in the app.

Your app needs to call GetUser [1] to see if an email address is awaiting verification. If it is, the app should call GetUserAttributeVerificationCode [2] to initiate the email verification flow and then submit the verification code by calling VerifyUserAttribute [3]. This is explained in our public documentation [4] under the notes section. You will be able to send the code to emails using this set up. 

Hope this helps. Let us know if you have any further queries.

AWS IoT Device Management	"Post Confirmation Lambda Trigger after Admin Create
Hi,

I currently have a Cognito Pool that should trigger a Lambda Post Confirmation trigger after a User is confirmed. However, I am never seeing the Post Confirmation trigger event be invoked after a User is confirmed.

I believe my process of setting up a user might be the cause of this:

1. Use adminCreateUser to build the new user.
2. Use adminInitiateAuth to login the user for the first time and get the NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED challenge.
3. Use adminRespondToAuthChallenge to respond and set the user's password so we bypass the need to have the user reset the password.

I am able to successfully create the user and login via this route. I see the user get to a confirmation status as well.

However, I never see a Post Confirmation event in the Lambda. I tested to make sure my Lambda was working by setting it for PreSignUp and PostAuthentication. Both of those triggered fine.

I also attempted with the standard flow of:
1. Create user as admin.
2. Get password temp for user to login via email.
3. Login for user with temp password and set new password.
4. See user get confirmed.

In that instance, no Post Confirmation event is recorded in Lambda either.

Any help or ideas I can try would be greatly appreciated."
AWS IoT Device Management	"Re: Post Confirmation Lambda Trigger after Admin Create
The Cognito User Pools service does not invoke Post Confirmation trigger in this case. Since setting the password after first sign in attempt is an authentication attempt, successful authentication and setting the password triggers Post Authentication trigger.

After 9 days, the problem has finally been resolved.

The only clue I have is that the default Cognito user pool limit has been increased to 1000 according to the docs, yet my 'create user pool' requests were being denied, citing the old default limit of 100. Both of these number ignored the fact that i had previously requested and received an increase to my limit.

AWS IoT Device Management	"""account with the email already exists"" error prevents email verification
Received the error ""An account with the email already exists."" when trying to verify an email address using a code.  Tested this several ways and believe this occurs when: 

1. Using Hosted UI, selecting 'Username and Also allow email login with verified email address' for sign-in. 
2. For Standard attributes, Email is selected and required.
3. Users are allowed to sign themselves up for an account.
4. Email is set for verification
5. Allowing Google and/or Facebook social login, with attribute mapping of email to User Pool email. 
6. Log in using either Google or Facebook. 
7. Try to 'Sign-Up' to create a User Pool account using an email that is associated with the Google or Facebook account you signed in as in step 6
8. System lets you create an account using that email, but then transitions to the screen to enter the verification code.  When you try to submit the code, the error ""An account with the email already exists."" appears at top, and user cannot complete verification. 

This is a typical scenario: A user logs in with a Social Login, and time passes.  They forget, and the come back to sign-up with a username/password.  But, if they try to use the same email that is associated with the social media account, they will run into this error. 

Also, if you start with no accounts, and do steps 1-5 above, but then reverse the user pool and social login steps like so: 
6. 'Sign-Up' to create a User Pool account and successfully verify your email using the code.
7. Log in using a Google or Facebook account that has the same email as in Step 6. 
8. The email used to create the User Pool account step 6 changes to 'Unverified'. 

I suggest that this behavior is a bug. It would seem that Social Media accounts and a User Pool account that share an email address should not create these effects.  OR that this Cognito configuration would not be allowed with Social Login.  OR that the user would not be allowed to get all the way to the email verification stage before being told they can't use that email address because it already is associated with a Google|Facebook|Standard Login account ... depending on the order in which the sign-ups occurred.

AWS IoT Device Management	"Re: Shield Standard:  What does it protect
AWS Shield Standard defends against most common, frequently occurring network and transport layer DDoS attacks that target your web site or applications. On Amazon EC2, your traffic levels are inspected by an auto-mitigation system that can engage when a well-defined DDoS attack signature is detected or at high levels of traffic, given your choice of instance type. UDP reflection attacks, like DNS reflection, NTP reflection, SSDP reflection, etc. are examples of common DDoS attack vectors that can be mitigated by this system.

For improved DDoS resilience across a wide range of attack vectors, like SYN floods or web application layer attacks, consider using Amazon CloudFront or Application Load Balancer (ALB) with AWS WAF. You can also use a Classic Load Balancer for non-web use cases and Amazon Route 53 to also protect against DNS query floods.

You can learn more about these recommendations in the AWS Best Practices for DDoS Resiliency which is available at https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/Security/DDoS_White_Paper.pdf .

Is Shield supported for non-web applications which are not even using a ELB? Can it be assigned to a VPC with public IP addresses? 
In this case, is there any additional protection does AWS-shield provide over and above the Security-groups/NACL ?"
AWS IoT Device Management	"Re: Shield support for non-Web Apps
With AWS Shield Advanced you can now add an Elastic IP Address (EIP) as a protected resource, which allows you to protect Amazon EC2 instances and Network Load Balancers (NLB's).

AWS IoT Device Management	"AWS Shield Advanced - Multiple Accounts
We've got several accounts all owned by the parent company, there are development, qa, and multiple production environments.  If we sign up for Shield advanced, will this cover only one of the accounts, or can we cover all of them?

Cheers

AWS IoT Device Management	"Re: AWS Shield Advanced - Multiple Accounts
If your organization has multiple AWS accounts, then you can subscribe multiple AWS Accounts to AWS Shield Advanced. You will pay the monthly fee once as long as the AWS accounts are all under a single consolidated billing, and you own all the AWS accounts and resources in those accounts.

AWS IoT Device Management	"What if I've got my clients in my AWS account? Are they protected?
I wonder if I contract Shield Advanced the clients I've got in my AWS account are protected with Shield Advanced too.
I've got a web design company and my clients are in my AWS account so it is easier to manage.
Thanks,"
AWS IoT Device Management	"Re: What if I've got my clients in my AWS account? Are they protected?
Hi,

You can enable AWS Shield Advanced for the protection of multiple AWS resources, as long as the subscribing AWS Account holder directly owns and manages the AWS resources. Further, AWS Shield Advanced's monthly fee applies per organization subscribed to AWS Shield Advanced. If your organization has multiple AWS accounts, you will pay the monthly fee once as long as you own all the AWS accounts and resources in that account.

AWS IoT Device Management	"TOTP on transaction validation
Hi community!

I searched through the Cognito docs and haven't found the answer to my problem.

Some transactions in my company system need to be confirmed by a token, because those transactions may lead to incorrect invoices and hence some major tax problems to be dealt later. We're still on architecture definition, and some AWS solutions need to be selected to plan our monthly budget and our development sprints.

After some research, I figured out that Cognito sends TOTP tokens when MFA is turned on, but apparently that's done only on login. I couldn't figure out however if Cognito can be used to send those TOTP tokens for other purposes, like the one described above. Is there a way to to that using this or any other AWS service, or is it better to develop a service compliant to RFC 6238?

I'd like to thank the help of you all in advance.

Best regards,
Guilherme Soares."
AWS IoT Device Management	"Pricing details for server to server communication (client credential flow)
Hi ,

Can some one help on pricing model for user pool only with app clients ? User pool created will not have any user but will have 2 app clients only (for server to server communication). In case of Client Credentials Flow, what are the billing charges ? It is based on number of hit to get the auth token ? Is there any charge on validating the token generated using url :  https://xxxxxxxx.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/token via API gateway authorizers ?

Is there any charge on creating domain name for resource server ?

Thanks,

AWS IoT Device Management	"How to use Cognito Identity Provider API through the API Gateway
I've tried to set an method in the API Gateway with the integration request pointing to the AWS Service ""Cognito Identity"" and Action to AdminGetUser. Testing the method I get in the response this  exception ""com.amazon.coral.service#UnknownOperationException"".
I've tried to force the Content-Type, the X-Amz-Target but nothing has produced a better response. I've tried to set up some new methods pointing to S3, Step Function and these ones return a right response.
Please, may you tell me if the operation I'm trying is admitted and if YES, where is the trick ?

AWS IoT Device Management	"Re: How to use Cognito Identity Provider API through the API Gateway
Hi,

I believe you don't have the x-amz-target header set up correctly. For AdminGetUser API on Cognito side, you need to set AWSCognitoIdentityProviderService.AdminGetUser as the value of x-amz-target with a POST method and the parameters in the payload.

POST

AWS IoT Device Management	"[Unity3D] Is there an economic way to grant app access to AWS services?
Hi,

Im pretty confused with some things. Im developing a game in Unity3D, and I want to use DynamoDB and S3 for players storage data.

I have in mind this two basic scenarios:

First scenario:

1) Players will authenticate with social platforms (Facebook, Google) using each platform SDK. If they login, they get an accessToken from the platform. Fine here.
2) Next, grant access to AWS by doing each player pass the accessToken credentials.AddLogin(""graph.facebook.com"", accessToken) in the AWS SDK;
3) Player can start using AWS services, DynamoDB, S3.

In this scenario, I will have one MAU for each player that login in the month. 10.000.000 unique logins in a month = 10.000.000 MAU = 10.000.000 * price of the MAU.

Second scenario (if possible)

1) Player will authenticate with social platforms (Facebook, Google) using each platform SDK.
2) App authenticate with Identity Pool ID in order to have access to AWS services.
3) Player can start using AWS services, DynamoDB, S3.

In this scenario, I can have infinite numbers of logins each month, but the MAU will be always 1 since its always the same for each player.

The questions are:
1) Is this 2 scenario possible?
2) Is possible to have an app with 10.000.000 users per month that let players use AWS services (DynamoDB, S3) without paying 10.000.000 MAU prices (at least paying for 1 MAU).

Thanks!"
