Web Services Bug Reports	"Power Search doesnt work with or
You're searching for a publisher named ""Time Warner or Little Brown.""   Try changing Power to something like ""(publisher:Time+warner)+or+(publisher:Little+Brown)"".
Also, please use a valid AWSAccessKeyId in example queries.  It's really annoying to try to help someone only to discover they've made it harder than it should be.

Hi,lots of thanks this works perfectly.
I'm sorry if you got confused because of the missing AWSAccesKeyID. Next time I will state more clear that I took it out of test requests.<FONT face=""Times New Roman"" size=""2"">
But I have followed the guideline from Amazon Documents:Note: Please take care not to post Your Access Key ID Here to the Discussion Board.Lots of thanks
Tobias</FONT>"
Web Services Bug Reports	"Power Search doesnt work with or
Please include your AWS Access key in example queries.  It's not secret (look at the URLs returned by AWS) and leaving it out just makes it harder for others to help you.
I don't recall anyone from Amazon suggesting that you shouldn't use your key in this forum.  In fact, representatives from Amazon have used their own keys in posts.
There may be some confusion because AWS recently introduced a ""secret key"" that you really should keep secret since it gives you access to paid services.  But the secret key never appears in URLs.
-- Roger"
Web Services Bug Reports	"Power Search doesnt work with or
The question of whether it is secure or not aside... the question of whether to post it or not was specifically asked in one of the chats because of the constant back-and-forth and it was the recommendation of the Web Services people that one ""not"" post their subscription id.   I agree it is easier to help people when they do but that is not Amazon's recommendation.Jim"
Web Services Bug Reports	"Missing Merchant Name for OffersFull
Hi,
I'm using ECS's OffersFull response group.
I've noticed that for some merchants, their Name do not appear in the XML markup. As a result, I'm unable to show my customers who they are buying from, which isn't good for trust.
For example, try this Asin: B000CFK07Q
please assist.

Web Services Bug Reports	"TimeoutError
I've been getting the exact same error.  I noticed it yesterday occurring about 2/3 of the time.  Today it seems to be happening about 1/3 of the time.  The message says ""Timeout waiting for data"", but it happens instantaneously, so I'm not sure why they call it a timeout.  I hope they get this fixed.  Here it is in its entirety: <UrlInfoResponse>- <OperationRequest><RequestId>&ltAccess Key Removed></RequestId></OperationRequest>- <UrlInfoResult>- <Request><IsValid>True</IsValid></Request>- <Errors>- <Error><Code>AWS.AlexaWebInfoService.TimeoutError</Code><Message>Timeout waiting for data.</Message></Error></Errors></UrlInfoResult></UrlInfoResponse>"

I can confirm that I've been getting the AWS.AlexaWebInfoService.TimeoutError in the last 2-3 days. It appears to be a global issue, and I hope the group moderators will post a comment soon.

Web Services Bug Reports	"TimeoutError
Hi,
I've been getting the same error. I just noticed it happening last night.
In my reports, it looks like I've been getting charged for this as well.
In the downloadable reports, it still shows my normal UsageValue's over each hour throughout the past couple of days, but i'm not getting any results.
It's pretty hard to write applications that depend on this information if it's not reliable!
Is there anything we can do to fix it?

My selection-based question forms validate successfully, but I can't make them work correctly for Qualifications OR HITs.

Web Services Bug Reports	"Time Out Error
hi Matt, actually, this is my 2nd month on AWS so I have yet to hit the 10k mark. i notice from my own counter that it differs from Alexa's when this problem arises... i'm now down to about 1 in 8 searches conducted via my site are being 'clocked-up' on Alexa. I'm assuming that this would mean requests resulting in the timeout error do not seem to be picked-up by their system. Hope this helps.
From my side, this bug is quite inconvenient... i went to press this week and my site is getting good interest.

Web Services Bug Reports	"Confused about nuance of 'keyword' srch
I'm baffled. When I go to the Amazon Power Search and search for     keywords:""ACT Exam"" I get about 120 matches. When I do the same thing in a programmatic query, however, I get two.

<FONT color=""blue"">(yes, I've pulled out my access key for privacy. :-)</FONT> 
Please don't do that.  You're asking for help, but making harder for us to help you.  There's no reason to remove your Access Key ID from examples you post here.
When I do a power search at Amazon.com using keywords:""ACT Exam"", I get the same two responses you're getting from ECS.

I'm still a bit baffled. I go to the Amazon Power Search page athttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/subst/search/books-power.html/103-3889308-9903034and enter   keywords:""ACT exam""and get:   All 178 results for keywords:""ACT+exam""Not two, 178.   ???"

Very Strange .....
I was using the power search form at:
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/stores/static/-/books/search/102-3388150-4393764
This one returns the same two items as your query.  I found it by clicking on ""Books"" then ""Books Search"" at Amazon.com.

Then perhaps I can ask you a different question?  How would you do an API search for all books about the SAT test, or the ACT test?  Thanks!DT"
Web Services Bug Reports	"Confused about nuance of 'keyword' srch
Try power searches for 
keywords:""American College Tests""
keywords:""Scholastic Assessment Test""
I found these keywords by looking at the product page for Amazon.com for a book on the subject.  Near the bottom of the page you'll see the book's keywords under ""Look for Similar Items by Subject.""

Another way is to list the products in the following browse nodes:

Hi, I've noticed that the Listname node of the ListmaniaList response group contains a typo error.
for example, the phrase ""My Friend's Gifts"" is spelt ""My Friend""s gifts"".

Web Services Bug Reports	"Either Actor or Director, but never both
Hi,
I've got possibly a bug to report. Lately I find that Amazon ECS is returning either Actors or Directors for DVD entries. Please take a look at the following search request on Amazon U.S., with response group set to large, only Director: Ron Howard is returned for keyword ""Cinderella Man"".
http://webservices.amazon.com/onca/xml?Service=AWSECommerceService&Version=2005-03-23&Operation=ItemSearch&SubscriptionId=&ltAccess Key Removed>&AssociateTag=mediaman-20&SearchIndex=DVD&Keywords=Cinderella%20Man&ResponseGroup=Large
However, the following same search query on Amazon U.K., returned Actor Russell Crowe and Renee Zellweger, but no Directors:
http://webservices.amazon.co.uk/onca/xml?Service=AWSECommerceService&Version=2005-03-23&Operation=ItemSearch&SubscriptionId=&ltAccess Key Removed>&AssociateTag=mediaman-20&SearchIndex=DVD&Keywords=Cinderella%20Man&ResponseGroup=Large
Now I'm sure that for these new entries in the catalog, both of the fields should already be in the ECS system. But why didn't ECS return these fields?
I think the bug appeared recently because several months ago, I'm sure I can get both fields.
Any suggestions?"
Web Services Bug Reports	"Either Actor or Director, but never both

Web Services Bug Reports	"Prices in ECS results not matching site?
Hello,Seems like the <LowestNewPrice> value in my results sometime don't match the prices on the site. Specifically, I just noticed a discrepency in the XML below.The list price matches, ($14), but the LowestNewPrice below is $2.99. Amazon.com is selling the book for $10.50.Any ideas?

Hi.
The LowestNewPrice is the lowest price among all the sellers selling that item as new. If you use the OfferFull response group, you should find a seller selling it at that price.

There is a bug with the xml-uk.amznxslt.com and xml-ca.amznxslt.com servers when processing a request in the UK and CA locales with a &Style= parameter for a custom XSL transform.

Searches via keyword on books only return one type of format for the search.

This has come up numerous times on this board and there is an answer, but I don't remember what it is exactly, even though I appear to have solved the problem on my site.

I'm not sure I am answering your question but maybe this will be helpful.  There is no direct way of getting all of the editions of a book in ECS4.

I've not really tried it in production as I want to keep everything in version 4.  Based on how it is implemented I am guessing it isn't 100% anyway but I could be wrong.

I agree that it is possible to approximate what is desired and in some situations it is good enough but, at least for my users, I need a reasonable level of certainty.  It is quite possible to get results that are not what is desired and to also not get results due to a slight variation in names/titles.Jim"
Web Services Bug Reports	"Single format for book returned
Indeed. For some titles I have to search on certain keywords rather than the full title, because the full title will not match all editions. These keywords have to be manually set up, of course, but only once for each title affected.
Furthermore in the returned results I do a match against what I believe the full title will be. If there is a 85% correlation between the two then I reckon it's the same book. This happens automatically.

The reason I know this is because I use a combo of PHP and XSLT. I log all calls to AWS and record any errors."
Web Services Bug Reports	"DNS Lookup Timeouts
Ahh yes, I also get problems with the US locale now with the good old 500 server errors. Only way to fix it is to remove dependancy on XSLT style sheets, but I use them to reduce the size of the rather large XML document returned.
Could using a fixed IP instead of *.amznxslt.com help?"

Could using a fixed IP instead of *.amznxslt.com help?That is what I do but that could be a nightmare as well. Looking into this a few weeks back - it looks like name server #4 is having a problem. Depending upon traffic - 1 out of 10 calls will timeout."
Web Services Bug Reports	"DNS Lookup Timeouts
Im getting repeatedly now these Internal 500 Server Errors, and in the hope that AWS can have a look at this thread and hopefully fix the problem, I thought I would detail explicitly what the problem is. 
I'm performing normal ItemSearch REST requests but with an XSLT style sheet parameter like so:<SPAN style=""FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial""><FONT color=""#454545""></FONT></SPAN>

<H1>Internal Server Error</H1>
The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable to complete your request.
Please contact the server administrator, awsadmin@amazon.com and inform them of the time the error occurred, and anything you might have done that may have caused the error.
More information about this error may be available in the server error log.
============
It doesn't happen all the time, i.e. the errors are spontaneous and as far as I can tell have no definite cause. It also happens on other locales, for instance the US, UK and CA locales, and this is using the xml-uk.amznxslt.com and xml-ca.amznxslt.com servers. When I get errors on one of the locales, sometimes I get the same errors on other locales and sometimes it works just fine on the other locales. 
When the errors do occur, they often stay around in 'blocks' - i.e. I could get the Internal 500 error every single time I try in one day, but the next it could be fine. Its not like every second request I get an error, rather when it does happen it will stay around for quite a while.
Also, I only seem to get the errors when searching the ""Blended"" Search Index. That is, even if I get an error on the US locale in Blended, if I change to another search index then everything works fine.
Moreover, the error is only to do with the XSLT servers. If I remove the &Style= parameter, everything works fine everytime. This indicates my REST request is valid.
If I change the &Style= parameter to point to a *nonexistent* style sheet, I still get Internal 500 errors! This shows that my XSLT style sheet I am using is not at fault.
In my particular scenario, its vital that I be able to use the XSLT transform functionality AWS provides. Ive racked my brain and I cannot think of any other way to do what I want to do. Besides, the problem is a random process which indicates to me that there is something wrong server-side.
AWS support, please help me out here! Others have had this problem too.

SayeSoft"

No - but I did hear how ""they"" changed availability in AWS 3 to somewhat mimic ECS 4 during some unknown time this year.

I get an ""invalid request"" for ISBN 076530239X, yet this ISBN is present and searchable on Amazon.com.  I also have a book listed with this ISBN, and the last time I ran my program, this particular ISBN presented no error. Any ideas what might cause this?
Call looks like:
http://webservices.amazon.com/onca/xml?Service=AWSECommerceService&SubscriptionId=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&Operation=ItemLookup&ItemId=B0007EAL2Q&Condition=Used&ResponseGroup=Request,Large&MerchantId=All
Thanks!
Karen K."

The example query you show is for a different item.  Change ItemId in the query to 076530239X and you'll get the results for the book.
BTW, please don't edit out your subscription ID in example queries you post here.  It makes it hard for others to help you and there's no reason for you to go to the trouble of doing that.

If you run the ECS4.0 Java Sample application it fails with a RemoteException and NullPointer Exception when using JRE or JDK1.5.  However if you switch to JDK1.4.2 the demo runs just fine.  I have a feeling it is a classloading or error with JDK1.5 but this demo NEEDS to run on 1.5 as well as 1.4.  Any help would be appreciated."

Hi,The Sample Application probably uses an old Axis version. Replace the delivered jars with Axis 1.2 or higher. Martin"

Web Services Bug Reports	"List price bug in german web service
I am noticing that the list prices returned from the web services for germany don't match the amazon.de web site.For example if you try this asin: B0002W4S7C http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002W4S7C/ Amazon.de has a list price of EUR 149,00 but web services returns a list price of EUR 39,00Thanks-pete"
Web Services Bug Reports	"List price bug in german web service
I tried the URL you provided and amazon.de displayed a price of 29,95 for used and 53,90 for new:
http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0002W4S7C/302-9891251-7473607
In the ECS4 call:
http://webservices.amazon.de/onca/xml?Service=AWSECommerceService&SubscriptionId=XXXXXXX&Operation=ItemLookup&ItemId=B0002W4S7C&ResponseGroup=Medium
I get the same prices for the lowest new and lowest used price.  I do get a list price of 39,00 but that doesn't come up in the lowest new price.   That's because the product isn't available.  
I don't see the 149,00.  Can you include the REST version of your ECS4 call and a screenshot of the 149,00 price?"

Behavior started Nov. 9th, title is the only attribute noticed missing, corrects itself after a few hours. Sometimes changing from medium to large works, sometimes not.  So far not a persistent problem, but a frustrating one.

Are you sure that it's not something on your end?  I haven't seen any evidence of the problem and my sites have made many ItemLookup queries since November 9.  How are you viewing or processing the results?
Also, when posting an example query in the forum, please don't remove your SubscriptionId.  There's no reason to remove it and it just makes it harder for others to help you if you do that.

No, its nothing on my end. When problem occurs, I view the XML reply, and the <title> </title> attribute  and tag is simply missing from reply, everything else is there. Only thing I notice is error usually happens around 6:30pm.

Web Services Bug Reports	"Availability Filter and MerchantId
I got stuck with following problem. All I want is having only products offered from the merchant ""Amazon"", not from other merchants.
But if i use the REST-query
http://webservices.amazon.com/onca/xml?Service=AWSECommerceService&SubscriptionId=<subscriptionid>&Operation=ItemSearch&SearchIndex=Electronics&Keywords=keyboard%20cordless&ResponseGroup=Small,Request,ItemAttributes,Offers&Availability=Available&Condition=All&MerchantId=Amazon&ItemPage=2
I also get items having not offers - meaning that the merchant ""Amazon"" does not offer those items. There are third-party merchants offering that item, which can be seen with:
http://webservices.amazon.com/onca/xml?Service=AWSECommerceService&SubscriptionId=<subscriptionid>&Operation=ItemSearch&SearchIndex=Electronics&Keywords=keyboard%20cordless&ResponseGroup=Small,Request,ItemAttributes,Offers&Availability=Available&Condition=All&MerchantId=All&ItemPage=2
But i don't want to have those items.
It seems to me that the ""Availability"" does only filter those items which are offered as ""new"" but does not concern the settings in  ""MerchantId"".
Is this a bug or feature?
When will it be corrected?
Thanks for your answer
