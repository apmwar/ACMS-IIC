General	"Re: AWS free tier utilization
Yes, you will be charged for usage that isn't covered by or goes beyond the free tier. You can set up a billing alarm to be notified when your upcoming bill exceeds a certain amount, which could very well be set to $0. That way you can quickly act on potentially unwanted charges, but there is unfortunately no way to automatically stay inside the free tier so to speak."

General	"Route 53 Alias A record to cloudfront distribution not working
Hi,

I've setup a very basic, html/css/images only static website which I've deployed using the AWS static website wizard. The wizard doesn't setup route 53 (which is already setup and working for the domain, for example email works fine as does my vpn) so I presume I do that manually.

My distribution is working fine, it's here: http://d10xdfumdsaq5d.cloudfront.net

I go into the route 53 console, create an A record, select Alias, it fails to load my distribution as per screenshot 2016-11-14_09_59_53.png attached so I manually cut and paste the name d10xdfumdsaq5d.cloudfront.net in. It resolves it to Alias Hosted Zone ID Z2FDTNDATAQYW2 which is not correct as when I look in the couldfront panel it's E18Y3E31BWYWBS. 

Consequently I get the error ""The request could not be satisfied."" Bad Request. As per screenshot 2016-11-14_10-05-35.png attached.

I have destroyed the buckets, cloudfront and so forth twice and repeated the process. Same result.

I've also tried to create an Alias directly to the bucket, bypassing Cloudfront. That fails, the console complains there is an error in the string aws-website-is-onptyltd-gc8l1.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com with the message 'Alias target contains an invalid value'.

General	"need help understanding security group settings
Hello, I'm one day new here at AWS having just set up Parse via Bitnami this morning. At the early stages following instructions from here https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html, I had set up restrictions on my security group. Specifically I limited inbound access via only for SSH and only for IP address XX.XXX.XXX.XX/32, ie my exact address.

With this set up, I was able to use cURL to write & query the Parse database. For example, I was able to do from the terminal:

curl -X POST -H ""X-Parse-Application-Id: __APP_ID__"" -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" -d '{""score"":1337,""playerName"":""Sean Plott"",""cheatMode"":false}' http://ec2-XX-XXX-XX-XX.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:80/parse/classes/GameScore

and get 

{""objectId"":""WU0OEZJsPK"",""createdAt"":""2016-11-24T21:02:53.096Z""}

But I was not able to load the Parse dashboard either thru http://ec2-XX-XXX-XX-XX.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/apps or thru parse-dashboard from here https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-dashboard. Neither was I able to write to Parse thru my test android app (running on both the emulator & an actual device) with error com.parse.ParseRequest$ParseRequestException: i/o failure.

The break-thru came just minutes ago when I decided to try ADDING access via HTTP for IP addresses XX.XXX.XXX.0/24 and suddenly everything that did not work before now worked. So my questions are:

1) If the dashboard & app did not work was because I did not give HTTP access before, why did cURL work when those calls also reference HTTP?

2) It so happens that the computer I did the cURL from, the dashboards I tried to run, my android emulator AND my actual android device all are accessing the internet via the same router connected to my ISP and therefore should all have the same IP address, why did cURL work and not the others? 

3) In real life, instances of the app can have any IP address, does that mean I need to configure 00.000.000.00 for HTTP which is exactly what the AWS instructions noted above stated upfront what we should not put into production?

4) How can I configure all connections to use HTTPS instead of HTTP? My app will eventually be ported to iOS which now requires all traffic to be over HTTPS (any HTTP traffic will trigger ATS error)?

It is not designed to work with products other than books.The package is free, but is funded by revenue-sharing on sales.

Some nodes (such as the <FONT color=""#0000ff"">Music</FONT> / <FONT color=""#800080"">New & Future Releases</FONT> node) just don't work with AWS/ECS.  It's probably because Amazon dynamically generates the product list for the node.

General	"New 400 page limit
If you're looking at any books, recall this sentence from the Amazon posting:""As for books, the search team will propagate this performance change in the next month.""The increase will apply to books by, they say, no later than 6 March, but is not yet in place.My question to Amazon is whether this is considered the end of the road on this matter, or only an interim palliative.  It helps, but--as several of us made explicit--it still cuts substantially the actual number of books certain of us,a not-negligible certain some, can offer our visitors.Recall that the typical fraction of titles returned that are actually available for purchase new from Amazon itself, which is the focus for many of us, is only about 30%; it thus works out that even 400 pages' worth is only about 1,200 listable titles.  A web-site specialty bookshop can, in my not-inconsiderable experience, readily list (using 26 alpha pages) three or four times, possibly five times, that many titles in a manageable way.It is an utterly false assumption that visitors to a widgets-oriented web site who browse that site's widgets bookshop are already pre-primed to buy X number of widgets books from whatever list is available.  People who may buy will buy *the particular widgets books that happen to interest them*.  If the available list is, say, 1/4 of all the more or less widgets-related books actually available, the odds of a visitor buying a book or books are 1/4 what they would be with the complete list.  (And listing by ""relevance"" or ""sales ranking"" doesn't matter on a specialty web site, where visitors' tastes are not likelty to duplicate those of the general public.)OK, Amazon, thank you for this very modest increase (whenever it actually happens).  BUT IT IS NOT ENOUGH!  We are still losing 60% to possibly 80% of our potential sales compared to what we could list were the limit, say, 1600 pages (if 3200 is out of reach).  Even 1600 would be something of a limitation in certain areas, but it would at least approach a resonable span.Whatever happened to all the talk of workarounds that would give us a bare ASIN list or some such thing?  Whatever the answer, we NEED more listings if we are to sell more books.Enough associates have posted here of their real, substantial dollar losses since the limit.  Those losses are real and hurtful to us, but *they are also direct losses to Amazon*.OK?"
General	"New 400 page limit
From the observed fact that the response time for page N of results increases linerly with N (regardless of the order in which pages 1 through N are requested), it's clear that Amazon aren't doing any sort of result set cacheing. So when we send them 250 queries for pages 1 through 250, they are doing 250 separate calculations of linearly increasing difficulty. So the actual processing cost to Amazon of one of us downloading N pages of results is O(N^2). From which it's pretty obvious that the increase from 250 to 400 page limit inherently increases Amazon's processing cost by a factor of 1.6 ^ 2 ~= 2.5. Presumably they've made some sort of efficiency improvements to offset this. But it's also clear that this is a losing battle due to the underlying O(N^2) algorithm, and the propect of getting significant further increases past 400 pages is poor. Certainly 3200 pages is going to be right out, that would increase their cost 60-fold, and the chance of them making 60-fold performance increases is negligable.So what I think we should be pushing them for is not an increased page limit, but for more results on each page. Suppose, for example, that we could make one request, wait a bit, and then get back one huge page with up to 32,000 results on it.  We get 8 times as many results as for 400 pages of 10, but the total processing cost to Amazon is actually much lower, of the order of 25 times lower than processing 400 separate queries. So everyone wins.So maybe the problem is that we've been asking them for the wrong thing. What we really care about is how the total number of results we can get, not how many pages it's spread across. Frankly, getting all the results in one batch would actually make our life easier, rather than having to loop and cumulate results.

Hi Matt,Thanks for letting us know.  I'm wondering if you would comment on what Arttwelve said.  Based on what we can see as users (which is only that the response time is linearly proportional to page number) it seems pretty likely that what he says is correct, and that you could save a huge amount of processing time by serving a query for a lot of results all at once instead of splitting them a few to to a page.

I'm with you on this one and had a rant in another place once upon a time. A kindly gent explained the situation as this: Major brands, lets so Fujitsu for example, spend a lot of money building up their brands reputation and factor in a certain exclusivity and prestige into their branding. Part of this is achieved by higher prices. Retailers who sell these products 'agree' not to promote heavily discounted product as it would 'cheapen' the brand. If a low price is brandished too widely the manufacturer may refuse to sell through a particular retailer.  Therefor the price - as sold - is too low for the retailer to be seen to promote.I still think that it is part of a price fixing scam, but that is the best explanation I have.Dean."

I've been testing a little bit to find the best work-around for the 250-page limit.
Amazon has said that performance issues are the reason why thelimit must be imposed. Testing shows that in cases where a nodehas a large quantity of pages, these issues become apparent even withpage numbers below 250. The severity of the problem seems tocorrelate with the total quantity of pages associated with a node.
For example, here are two graphs that show the response times forrequesting pages 1 through 250 from node 10250 (poetryanthologies) which has 2315 pages in total. This node is a leaf node (anode without child nodes) so this request cannot be avoided bysearching child nodes instead. Response times are taken from Amazon's""RequestProcessingTime"" field. The only difference between the twographs is the order in which the pages are requested. The samepages were requested in both graphs.
The graphs show that response times are excellent for the lowestnumbered pages, about a quarter of a second. But for pages close to100, response time nearly quadruples to around a second, and forpages close to 250, the required time lengthens to two full seconds.

<IMG alt="""" src=""http://associateshaven.com/art/time_down_10250.gif"" /> 
For Amazon's comments about this problem, go here. 
Here are the arguments for the request that was used to generatethese graphs:
<Argument Name=""ItemPage"" Value=""XXX"" /> <Argument Name=""BrowseNode"" Value=""10250"" /> <Argument Name=""ResponseGroup"" Value=""Offers,OfferFull,ItemAttributes"" /> <Argument Name=""Operation"" Value=""ItemSearch"" /> <Argument Name=""Service"" Value=""AWSECommerceService"" /> <Argument Name=""AWSAccessKeyId"" Value=""XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"" /> <Argument Name=""SearchIndex"" Value=""Books"" />

Just a couple of quick preliminary thoughts.First, the manifest linearity is interesting.  The prior Amazon remarks suggested a distinctly nonlinear process with an ""elbow"" somewhere around 250 pages.  It looks more like its just an arbitrary cutoff limit.Second, equally interesting and possibly more germane would be to see actual end-user times from request to page received, possibly clocked by php or some such.  Granted, varying transmission times might fuzz the issue, but what is important to Amazon and what is important to the user are not quite the same thing.(I'd do the test myself, but haven't any spare time whatever--don't know why I'm even doing this post)."

nonlinear process with an ""elbow"" somewhere 
around 250 pages.

That's how I read their comments also.  And for all we know, it may be true that things suddenly become worse with page numbers above 250.  We can't tell.  But there are two other things that we know for sure:  With certain nodes, including the one tested here, (1) performance is poor even below page 250, and (2) the arm is badly sloped even before we reach the supposed elbow.

...would be to see actual end-user times from request to
page received... I'd do the test myself, but....

I just timed it this way on my desktop using a cable connection.  The results look pretty much like the other ones, except with a constant added on for the transit times, so Amazon's reported processing times seem to be accurate.

General	"250 page limit  performance issues
You're forgetting something. If the time for page N is O(N), then the cumulative time for all the pages from 1 through N is O(N^2). Which is not quite a hockey stick like their orginal comments when they imposed the page limit suggested, but is still a lousy scaling law to be fighting (maybe whoever wrote the release exagerated the steepness of the curve a bit, or just didn't have a good grasp of scaling laws?). Going from 250 to 400 is a 60% increase in number of results, but represents a 1.6^2 ~= 2.5-fold increase in the cumulative processing time (if the constant were still the same, which it sounds like it isn't from what they recently announced). But this is a losing battle, like anything O(N^2). What we clearly need here is a solution that is not O(N^2) in the number of results we actually get.The most obvious solution is not to increase the maximum number of pages, but to increase the number of results per page. It's pretty clear that one page with results #1-#4000 wouldn't take them much longer for them to caluclate than it currently takes them to calculate results #3991-#4000 for page 400 (and would take them less bandwidth to send us than 400 pages of 10 results each). [Clearly figuring out what results #3991 through #4000 are actually involves finding all of the first 4000 results (there's no other way to do the sort), and then throwing #1 through #3990 away, which is fundamentally hugely inefficient.] Net cumulative saving to them of doing this are something like 200-fold, which should be more than enough to persuade them to send us more results in exchange. So I think what we should be asking for is not 3,200 pages with 10 results on each, but one very large page with 32,000 results on in. My back-of-an-envelope calculations suggest that (if the linearity hold out that far, and offhand I can't see any theoretical reason why it shouldn't, it's not like these result sets are too large to fit into RAM, and indeed this used to work back before they imposed the 250 page limit) that would actually be significantly easier for them than sending us pages 1 through 400 each with 10 results. Regardless of the details or assumptions, going to an approach that is inherently O(N) rather than O(N^2) ought to be a big win for both us and Amazon.

> going to an approach that is inherently O(N) > rather than O(N^2) ought to be a big win...Another way to do this, in cases where the data is being requested in index order, might be for Amazon to include on each page the last index key value reached.  Then we'd send that back with our next page request as the starting value.This is just a variant of the ""request by price range"" workaround that Amazon suggested last year.  I use that in my program and even with nodes that have page counts of 2000+, the downloads arrive at a steady speed of one page per second all the way through.The difference would be that there doesn't seem to be any way at present to figure out the highest price reached.  At least, I couldn't figure out a reliable way. So what I do is specify both a low and high limit and keep requesting pages until AWS runs out.  This is pretty messy to say the least.  Users shouldn't have to do that kind of stuff."

AWS/ECS doesn't provide a direct way to determine the parent for a specific browse node.  You can indirectly find the parent by looking at the BrowseNodes response group for a product in the node.
You can use the web services provided by BrowseNodes.com to find the parent of a specified node.  See:

Hi Folks,Maybe I missed the answer in the documentation somewhere -- While browsing through several album titles, I ran across albums which list Creators but do not have any Artists. Take for example, Harem, ASIN: B00009L1U7. On Amazon.com's website, the CD is listed as by just Sarah Brightman.However, an AWS query (Medium or Large response group) returns a large collection of Creator values, and no Artist values. Worse, some Creator values seem to be managled in an odd format:<Creator Role=""Performer"">Sarah / Johnson, Brian / Heussenmann, Carsten Brightman</Creator>Obviously all the Creators returned are all the backing singers, writers, and orchestras who are on the album. So question is, for a case like this, how do you actually identify who the album is by given results? Is there some parameter that needs to be set in order to get the right info?Thanks,"

There are some problems with returning prices for beauty / apparel. I don't know anything about this other than what I've read on the board.
You will get ""price too low to show"" sometimes which I think is deliberate on the part of Amazon to avoid returning misleading low prices. Some vendors show an incorrect (fraudulent, I suppose) low price of $0.01 and then either charge a fortune for P&P or simply use the product description to entice you to contact them directly thus cheating Amazon out of its margin. At least, that's my understanding.
I believe it is supposed to be MerchantId not MerchantID but it may be that Amazon has now case-desensitized this.
I suggest you post a new message with the heading ""prices not returned for apparel"" and hopefully it may catch the eye of someone who knows more about it than I do!

Hilary Duff and Lindsay Lohan and even Scrub's Donald Faison have browsenodes BUT Renee Zellweger doesn't, neither Jake nor Maggie Gyllenhaal do, Colin Farrell, etc. etc.How is that NBA legend/Airplane star Kareem Abdul Jabbar has a browsenode, but various Oscar nominees don't?"
