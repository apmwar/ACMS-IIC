Web Services Beta Feedback	"SimpleQueue and ReadCount
Hello!I am currently using Amazon Simple Queue in a test application.One operation reads items from the queue.I want to read all items of the queue. (There are 10 items in the queue)I set the ReadCount to 25 and the ReadLockTimeoutSeconds to 0My Query for Reading the Queue looks like htis:http://webservices.amazon.com/onca/xml?Service=AWSSimpleQueueService    &AWSAccessKeyId=xyz1234    &Operation=Read    &QueueName=myQueueName    &ReadCount=25    &ReadLockTimeoutSeconds=0Now i would expect i can read all 10 items (as i set ReadCount to 25) in one request, but the request only returns 2-4 items once.Does anybody have an idea what could be wrong?Greetz          fitzecarraldo"
Web Services Beta Feedback	"Mass Ban?
Looks like I have been banned a long with most other users.  Is this true?  I know that I have not been using any bots or anything that violates the TOS to my knowledge and would like to shed some light on this issue.  I also had about $170 on my dashboard waiting to be sent to the 'my account' page that I can no longer access.  I hope that this can be resolved and I can get back to my account and continue turking soon.  Thanks."

I have similar concerns. My approval rate was roughly 87% and suddenly the site started putting me into the infinite forward loop mode.

Web Services Beta Feedback	"Turk Requester Toolkit
Problems building Mechanical Turk Requester Toolkit. Got following error  in connection with [generate-axis] target of build.xml script:
'The <urn:maven-artifact-ant:dependencies> type doesn't support the nested ""dependency"" element. '
My Windows 2000 system has JDK 5.0, Ant 1.6.1, JWSDP 1.6, and Axis 1.2.1 installed, with their environment variables set as per docs.
I want JAXB binding, so I first ran ant as follows:

Build failed with error: 'The <urn:maven-artifact-ant:dependencies> type doesn't support the nested ""pom"" element.'
As a workaround, I copied JAXB-related .jar files (8) to the \binding\jaxb\pom folder, which helped get me past the [prepare-jaxb] target. I've studied the build.xml and rtk-with-jaxb.pom files, and they both show nested <dependency> elements. Is this caused by Ant or  the Maven (maven-artifact-ant-2.0-dep.jar  not handling the <urn:maven-artifact-ant:dependencies> namespace for the nested <dependency> elements?"

Thanks, John, for replying to my inquiry. I'm still unable to build the Mechanical Turk Requester Toolkit, but I have made significant progress.

I was able to build the Mechanical Turk Toolkit after changing the ANT_HOME environment variable (in Windows) to point to the JWSDP-1.6\apache-ant directory. ANT_HOME had pointed to Apache Ant 1.6.1, which does not include the FileList$FileName.class in ant.jar

I think I know why this may be working for you and not me.  I apologize if I was being too vague.  I am interested in creating a Native/Unmanaged/not .NET C++ application.
If I create a Managed (""CLR"") C++ application, this works fine.
Exact steps to reproduce:
- File->New Project
- Visual C++->Win32->Win 32 Console Application->OK
- In the Win32 Application Wizard hit Finish
- Select the project in Solution Explorer
- Project->Add Web Reference

- Go->Add Reference
 
More info:
When I tried this in Visual C++ 2005 Express Beta 2 the ""Add Web Reference"" menu item is disabled when I'm working with a Win32 application.  Therefore, you may need to try this either in the non-express version of Visual C++ 2005, or in Visual C++ .NET 2003.
Alternatively, I've attached a project I created in the non-express version of VC++ 2005.  You can open this project in VC++ 2005 Express and see the problem.
Still more info:
Under the covers, VC++ is using the sproxy.exe tool to generate the proxy code and this is what is failing.  So if you don't want to mess with all this project stuff, you can reproduce this fairly easily with any version of VC++ (VC++ .NET 2003, VC++ 2005 Express, VC++ 2005 not-express...).

Web Services Beta Feedback	"Alexa doesn't sweep and clean perfectly
Alexa doesn't sweep and clean perfectly :
 
I moved many of my Apparel Sites from ASIN links to AWS links.
And I notice that Alexa is not sweeping and cleaning the websites in total perfection. ( The AWS links )
There are many apparel products that are unavailable, or ""out of stock"" and Alexa does not say anything.
As a result I am worried about this tool. Because many products that are unavailable continue inside my many apparel pages.

Web Services Beta Feedback	"Alexa doesn't sweep and clean perfectly
I wish that I am wrong but my data continues giving indication that Alexa fails finding all those garments that are ""Out of Stock"" or Unavailable.
My opinion is that Alexa ( for uncovering these unavailable items ) has been a Wonderful Tool, a Very Useful Tool for me. And I deeply thank its existence.
Alexa has been a Wonder and a Beauty. But I am lately very worried about its accuracy.
Since I moved into AWS links things seem to have changed and Alexa does not uncover all ""bad offers"", those offers without inventory.
Vicente"
Web Services Beta Feedback	"Alexa doesn't sweep and clean perfectly
Sorry if I am repetitive.
But Alexa is not picking the ""Out of Stock"" or ""Backordered"" items.
It is skipping over many problems and unavailable items.
Reports have almost no problems, but the websites are full of availability problems.

Ugly Tags inside Apparel Descriptions for XSLT
Something went wrong in the last day ( or last two days ) with the Product Descriptions of Many Apparel Items in the XSLT system.
For example the item B0000865Q9 gives this Ugly Text :

<FONT size=""1"">Other Respectful Complaints :</FONT>
<FONT size=""1"">I also complain of these Apparel Merchants :</FONT>
<FONT size=""1"">1) Why is it that Carabella ( an old merchant inside Amazon ) introduces hundreds and hundreds of new items, products or ASINS without images ???</FONT>
<FONT size=""1"">2) The same question for Newport News : Why they don't care about the Middle Image in XSLT for many new products ???</FONT>
<FONT size=""1"">3) Why is it that other Apparel merchants like Cherokee, Merona, Xhilaration do not care about producing the middle image in XSLT.</FONT>
<FONT size=""1"">4) I hope that there are no more catastrophes of Merchants leaving Amazon like : Spiegel, Wintersilks and Venus Swimwear.</FONT>
<FONT size=""1"">5) I pray every dawn before sunrise that no more ""Excluded Merchants"" are added to the list. For my system of sales and my domain names the ""Excluded Merchants"" are a stab on my back.</FONT>
<FONT size=""1"">I hope that these critiques are taken for the benefit of the bottom line of Amazon and for the dynamism of AMZN corporation and not as an angry rant of a frustrated associate.</FONT>
<FONT size=""1"">I feel like my sales would double if you ever authorize me to offer Nordstrom, Land's End, Liz Claiborne and Elisabeth etc ... ( a little lie is permisible once a month for every salesman !! )

Web Services Beta Feedback	"Can I insert XSLT inside phpBB Forum ???
Dear Friends :
I am in the last version of phpBB and working on a Forum.
I don't like the idea of placing a link to another of my domain names inside one of my phpBB posts so that the people in  a thread buy from me.
Creating an HTML page inside the Forum Domain Name in order to sell that thing that we are talking about ( and placing a link ) is also very cumbersome and leading to disorganization.
I don't want to place the ""ASIN Link"" 
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/theProductASINcode/ref=nosim/myAmazonID
because I want the image and the availability being sent from Amazon automatically as Datafeed showing the last price, image, etc ...
So that people can immediately talk about the product offered and praise or criticize it. Or even offer an alternative or better deal. !! 
Is that possible in today's phpBB technology ???
Does it require complex Mods or Hacks by experts ???
Any URL that teaches the trick ??
Do we have to wait for another phpBB Version ???
Any other Forum technology that does the trick ???
Thanks for help

Hi Ozorg,
I think you are experiencing a timeout bug. It is caused by poor coordination between AWS and Alexa... basically AWS times out before the Alexa search can respond. We should have it fixed in the next month or so.
In the meanwhile, you can try reducing the relevance. You will find that lower relevances time out less frequently.

I know that I can not blame Amazon for the Foolishness and indiscipline of some of the Merchants or Brands that sell using the Wonderful System of ECS.
But if Amazon can do anything, then please do it. I can not see how the present situation of disorder can benefit the customer, the buyer, Amazon or the Associate.
People would flock to other websites where they can buy the merchandise. Useless to have a beautiful ECS technology if the buyer can not act because of ""Out of Stock"".
Wal Mart has fought a hard battle against the cancer of ""Out of Stock"", that is offering products that are not available.

Carabella during the past three days.

Newport News, Venus Swimwear, Merona, Cherokee, etc ...
Carabella was a great infractor before the Total Collapse.
 
JCPenney inside Amazon is a total Mess :
It is almost useless to work with JCPenney offerings inside Amazon. They are fleeting creatures that live for less than one or two weeks, if you are lucky.
I know that many people will tell me that the coming Spring is the Guilty Man, and that this should always happen with the arrival of Spring. As if the slow and gradual change of Seasons was the excuse for a breakdown of law and order inside product offerings. Things need to be more planned, ordered, methodical, progressive and continuous.
I hope that something can be done. Great Technology, but lack of discipline by merchants. They just don't fill the information. Or stay out of Amazon while selling somewhere else.

Hi,Thanks for participating in the beta. First of all, we need to change the ""XML Aggregation failed"" message text. It is essentially a timeout failure. This means that at least one of the search servers did not respond within the timeout.

Web Services Beta Feedback	"Whimsical Images. Loss of Spiegel Collec
Whimsical Images.
Loss of Spiegel Collection
 
Hi. Look at these troubles please :
 
1)  Apparel XSLT : Many Images stop working in XSLT from one day to next. Even if the products are available within 24 hours.
For example these medium images were perfectly working and now they have stopped suddenly : 
B000121AS
B000121X8A
B0000UTLTQ
B0002LWTRY
2) The Spiegel Collection has been totally absolutely unavailable for more than one month. But XSLT continues sending information and images. It would be a good idea to give some information to Associates on what is going on. Are negotiations proceding in order to repair the Spiegel-Amazon marriage ???
3) Newport News, Carabella, Venus Swimwear, Merona, Bra Smyth, Silhouettes, and many other brands lack the middle images for a great part of their apparel products.
I know that Amazon is not guilty of recklessnes and that the brands have some responsibility in filling the Information. They should complete the data with care and love and not leave things half finished.
In Newport News there are strange tags inside the Datafeed Information for some products.  I have already pointed out that problem in past posts in this forum.
Filling the Information that is lacking would be for the benefit of everybody and of Amazon in Special. 
It would be a good idea to send the Availability Variable for ""Back Ordered Products"" with a future date when you can buy the product. Newport News and Eddie Bauer are just doing that. But we need to generalize this good idea for the other brands. So that the Associate has less work to do with the whimsicalities of ""Out of Stock""....
Thanks for any attention.

Web Services Beta Feedback	"Collect Apparel Garbage - Wal Mart Examp
Collect Apparel Garbage - Wal Mart Example
Praise Wal Mart \!!!
I read that Wal Mart has been in a strong campaign to avoid offers to the public which are not ready available ... This is for Bricks and Mortar and also for Online Systems.
The philosophy of Wal Mart : Seriousness and Constancy in Offers. Respect for the customer or visitor.
Offering beautiful things that can't be bought tomorrow is a waste of time, for everybody but specially for the KING ( the customer ).
Offers should be constant for a rational amount of time and intermitent ""Out of Stock"" has to be avoided.
Inside Amazon :
Spiegel has been totally unavailable inside Amazon for many weeks. A Huge powerful collection has apparently quarrelled with Amazon. Is there any spat ??? ..... Is there any divorce of this happy marriage ???
But the images continue being sent by XSLT ( with unavailable of course )... this is super frustrating.
Other brands that are Increasingly Irresponsible and that tease the customer like in a strip tease are these :
Bealls Florida and JCPenney
Their items are available for less time than cakes in a kindergarden.
So it is a waste of time for Associates and visitors to fall in love with the pretty items. But it is love at first sight. Because if they wait then the item will be unavailable tomorrow.
I am a total ignorant of marketing, retailing and eTailing. But my intuition tells me that this is not right.
I get the idea that the visitor is the Guinea Pig for Marketing Studies and that Amazon Apparel becomes the kingdom of Fleeting Availabilities that become Ghost Unavailabilities.
Vanishing Ghosts of a Bewitched House.
Another complaint : big important collections lack the middle image for XSLT and for many products ... The greatest pain is Newport News, as I have posted here several times. Carabella also fails for many beautiful products.
