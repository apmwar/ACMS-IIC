Amazon Fulfillment Web Service	"How do you calculate the ""Signature"" value for an Amazon MWS query in VB6
Please help!

I'm trying to submit queries to Amazon's servers to get information on our orders and I know nothing about HMAC, SHA-256, etc. I've managed to get everything set up in a Visual Basic 6 program in order to submit the XML queries, but I get an error message from the Amazon server saying that the ""Signature"" parameter is required. Does anyone know how you can use VB6 to come up with this value and for that matter, what information does Amazon want me to feed into a function in order to come up with the value? 

I've read the Amazon MWS Orders API Section Reference manual, but it seems to make a lot of assumptions about the signature value without spelling it out.

Thanks,

Well first start with the MWS API for guidance.

Docs are here:
https://developer.amazonservices.com/gp/mws/docs.html

Also...... don't know of anything for VB6 but maybe this will help:

https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/mwsportal/doc/en_US/fba/inventory/v20101001/MWSDeveloperGuide.V175102177.pdf

Creating an Amazon MWS Request

Amazon MWS supports query requests for calling web service actions. Query requests are simple HTTP requests, using the GET or POST method with query parameters in the URL or HTTP body, respectively. Amazon MWS requires the use of HTTPS to prevent third party eavesdropping on your communication with Amazon.

Each of the HTTP header lines must be terminated with a carriage return and a line feed. Query requests must contain an Action parameter to indicate the action to be performed. The response is an XML document.

The Amazon MWS Developer Guide goes into detail on how to create a valid HTTP query request. Note that Amazon MWS Scratchpad is a helpful tool for understanding how to create correctly formed HTTP query requests. Amazon MWS Scratchpad automatically generates and displays many of the inputs that are required in a HTTP query request to Amazon MWS. Examining the Amazon MWS responses that Amazon MWS Scratchpad displays for each of your query requests can help you build successful parsing logic.

Amazon Fulfillment Web Service	"Re: How do you calculate the ""Signature"" value for an Amazon MWS query in VB6
Thank you for the reply. I appreciate the help.

Let me make myself clear.

I already know how to submit queries to Amazon. I'm am 99% of the way there - I have submitted queries and received an error message from the Amazon server stating that the ""Signature"" field is required. 

I have further (since my last post) gathered some informatiion on SHA-256 encryption and I believe that I have the VB code that I need in order to generate the signature.

I can't TEST that my code works because I have no idea what Amazon wants me to use as a ""key"" (I've assumed that this is either my AWS Access Key ID or my Secret Key, but I can't find anywhere in the documentation that tells me what to use) and further, I don't know what the string is that I'm supposed to submit for encryption.

I have already used the MWS Scratchpad (again, before writing my first inquiry) and because of that, I know that the Signature value changes even if you are requesting the same data, so I'm assuming that whatever this elusive string is that I submit for encryption to create the Signature value also changes, presumably because the timestamp is part of the string.

Is that clearer?

Let's pretend that I already have a simple function like:

Signature=(""key"", ""message"")

that did the encryption using SHA-256 and further conversion to Base 64 HMAC (please forgive me if I've worded something strangely - this is new territory for me). I may actually have this now, but I don't have any way to test it BECAUSE...

My problem right now is that I have no idea what to use instead of ""key"" or ""message"" in order to arrive at the Signature. Anyone who could at least tell me WHERE in the many Amazon manuals I can find the section on what these two pieces are would be my friend for life and could have Christmas dinner at my house.

Thanks,

SSssssooooooo ... you didn't follow the link to MWSDeveloperGuide and read page 12 ..... did you? ; )

Pg 12

Creating a query request

To create an Amazon MWS query request, you first construct a query string with the query information.

You then sign this query string and include it in the request submission. Note that the query string cannot contain white space or line breaks. The string consists of:

• The HTTP action. This value is most often POST.
• The domain name of the request, such as https://mws.amazonservices.com/. For a list of endpoints for each Amazon marketplace, see the Amazon MWS Endpoints section in this guide. After the endpoint is a forward slash (/), which separates the endpoint from the parameters.
• AWSAccessKeyId (click to get one)—Your Amazon MWS account is identified by your Access Key ID, which Amazon MWS uses to look up your Secret Access Key.
• Action—The action you want to perform on the endpoint, such as the operation
GetFeedSubmissionResult.
• Parameters—Any required and optional request parameters.
• Marketplace—Your Marketplace ID.
• Merchant or SellerId—Your Merchant ID.
• SignatureMethod—The HMAC hash algorithm you are using to calculate your signature, either SHA256 or SHA1.
• SignatureVersion—Which signature version is being used. This is Amazon MWS-specific information that tells Amazon MWS the algorithm you used to form the string that is the basis of the signature. For Amazon MWS, this value is currently SignatureVersion=2.
• Timestamp—Each request must contain the timestamp of the request. Depending on the API function you're using, you can provide an expiration date and time for the request instead of or in addition to the timestamp.
• Version—The version of the API section being called.
The following example is a query string for a GetFeedSubmissionResult request.
Note: The example query string contains line breaks and white space which are shown for ease of reading. The actual query string cannot contain white space or line breaks. All query string examples in this guide are formatted for readability.

Example I will UNformat):
POST
mws.amazonservices.com
/ 
AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAFJPPO5KLY6G4XO7Q&Action=GetFeedSubmissionResult&FeedSubmissionId=4321011681&Marketplace=ATVPDKIKX0DER&Merchant=A3F1LGRLCQDI4D&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2011-02-04T23%3A08%3A19Z&Version=2009-01-01


I have already used the MWS Scratchpad

Click on Request Detail see see the string also....

Amazon Fulfillment Web Service	"Re: How do you calculate the ""Signature"" value for an Amazon MWS query in VB6
All right, either I'm really dim (the most likely case) or you're not understanding my question. Yes, I've read that part of the manual. As far as I can tell it says NOTHING about how to calculate the signature value. I'm sure it's in there, but it's not in the stuff you posted on this thread and not in anything I've been able to find.

The sample in your reply is much like the one's I've sent to Amazon - it does NOT contain the parameter (which I am assuming is just part of the submission string) &Signature=(whateverthe signature is). When I post queries to Amazon that are similar to the one you listed as an example, it comes back with an error saying that the Signature parameter is required.

I've also found nothing in the Amazon manual that says what is used to create the Signature value. I need to encrypt something with a key value using HMAC-SHA-256 -  what is that string that I need to encrypt and what do I use for the key value?"
Amazon Fulfillment Web Service	"Re: How do you calculate the ""Signature"" value for an Amazon MWS query in VB6
Maybe I'm getting this now. Is the manual saying that the string to encrypt is:

AWSAccessKeyId=&ltAccess Key Removed>&Action=GetFeedSubmissionResult&FeedSubmissionId=4321011681&Marketplace=ATVPDKIKX0DER&Merchant=A3F1LGRLCQDI4D&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2011-02-04T23%3A08%3A19Z&Version=2009-01-01

in the example?

If so, how do you then send the Signature parameter? Do you add it onto this string? Do you send it instead of this string?"

SSssssssooooooooooo  CCCCcccllllllllloooooosssssseeeee ...LOL

I think some of the confusion is in looking closely at the ScratchPad I don't see where they show you the signed URL. It might be in a different version I have.

Also let me add in here that I'm still not sure about how to do what exactly because I'm not a programmer.

I just know that basics.................

Look at my post with ""Example I will UNformat):""

THAT whole thing is the string to (sign) encrypt......... as noted in the Developer Guide top of page 13.

If you look at the tab in ScratchPad, ""Request Details"", towards the bottom in a blue bar it says ""String to sign"" and has:

POST
mws.amazonservices.com
/ 
AWSAccessKeyId=********&Action=GetFeedSubmissionResult&FeedSubmissionId=4371429174&Merchant=****&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2011-09-12T18%3A57%3A05Z&Version=2009-01-01


So you do something like a ...
HmacSHA256 (
POST
mws.amazonservices.com
/ 
AWSAccessKeyId=********&Action=GetFeedSubmissionResult&FeedSubmissionId=4371429174&Merchant=****&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2011-09-12T18%3A57%3A05Z&Version=2009-01-01)


Then take that signature and do the HTTP post or add it to the URL ... A completed one looks like this and is at the bottom of page 14 / top 15.

https://mws.amazonservices.com/AWSAccessKeyId=********
&Action=GetFeedSubmissionResult
&FeedSubmissionId=**** 
&Merchant=ANZE9ULNDLIJJ
&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256
&SignatureVersion=2
&Timestamp=2011-09-12T18%3A57%3A05Z
&Version=2009-01-01
&Signature=******************
1HTTP/1.1Host:mws.amazonservices.comX-Am
azon-User-Agent:AmazonJavascriptApp/1.0(Language=Javascript)Content-Type:text/xml


Not exactly sure about that 1HTTP/ ... copied from example but the 1 may not go in there.

After that you're on your own.... Base 64? MD5 ??? Not much of a clue.

I've got it working in Java but I got away from the signed request and went to opening/connecting to the WebServiceClient .....not even 100% on how I did that...LOL

Thanks for all the responses, however, I'm not sure they are exactly what I am looking for. I think my explanation wasn't very clear.To simplify, forgot any consideration of my website. I just want to be able buy things off Amazon.com with a script. For example, have a PHP script that accepts a product id and shipping address, and when called, accesses an Amazon.com web service to place an order with instructions to ship to the given address. Ideally, this would be done without human input; however, if necessary, it do something like queue orders and simply have a human rubber stamp it. Don't worry, I know how to code the PHP - I am not asking someone to do the job for me. I just don't know of any Amazon published web service that would allow for that functionality.@mark: It seems to me that Corporate accounts still require a human to physically place the order.@Joel: I initially looked at the Associate's program, but I could only find product advertising tools there. Everything dealt with referrals and links back to Amazon.com. I am hoping for a solution that allows me to run a script to actually execute the purchase.I am new to the e-commerce and AWS realm, so forgive me if the answer to this question is obvious."
Amazon Fulfillment Web Service	"Re: Using FWS to buy any Amazon item?
I have a similar requirment from my client, who wants a semi ""secret santa"" application where users can buy an amazon item for another user.

the problem with the associate program is that it requires the user to go through the entire purchase, including filling out the shipping adress, which for privacy reasons, our users do not want to be publicly available.(although we(the host) internally have the addresses for each user)

A function where my company can trigger a purchase of a specific amazon item with a shipping adress  is all we really need, but I am afraid this does not exist. Can FWS do this?

I suppose we could let the user simply choose an item(but not buy it).  An we could manually make the purchase for them, but this has obvious scalablitly issues, and we would not be getting the associate percentage..

Has anyone else solved the bug in the FBA Outbound API - PHP sample code? When creating a ""CreateFulfillmentOrder"" the documentation is lacking quite a bit on how to add items. Fumbling around I created the following process to add and item:

=== PHP code ===
// collect item values
$order_item_query 		= ""SELECT * FROM order_details WHERE order_id ='"".$receipt_number.""'"";
$order_item_result 	= $db -> Execute($order_item_query)

	$afn_item-> setSellerSKU($order_item_row);
	$afn_item-> setSellerFulfillmentOrderItemId($receipt_number.""-"".$order_item_row);
	$afn_item-> setQuantity($order_item_row);
	$afn_item-> setFulfillmentNetworkSKU($order_item_row);

	$afn_item-> setDisplayableComment(""This is an example DisplayableComment"");
	$request-> setItems($afn_item);

The problem is when it is called I found there is a mistake / error / bug in the sample code. The sample 'Client.php' file calls ""$itemscreateFulfillmentOrderRequest->getmember()"" but the getmember() function does not exist.

I replaced:
$itemscreateFulfillmentOrderRequest = $request->getItems();
foreach ($itemscreateFulfillmentOrderRequest->getmember() as $memberitemsIndex => $memberitems) {

with the following:
foreach ($request->getItems() as $memberitemsIndex => $memberitems) {
                if ($memberitems->isSetSellerSKU()) {

... but now I get an error from the server saying:
Caught Exception: The request must contain the parameter Items.

So, is there a 40$ / month subscription for using Amazon FBA? Here: https://forums.aws.amazon.com/message.jspa?messageID=97029 someone asked the same question and the person who answered said:

Yet, here http://www.amazon.com/gp/seller-account/mm-product-page.html?topic=200274770 it clearly shows that FBA is enabled as an individual seller and that there is no monthly fee at all. Only a free per sell. 

Why the contradiction? Can I use FBA selling maybe 5-10 items a month and not LOSE money; getting 25$ in sales of 2$ bath powder packets that I have no use for, then getting charged 40$?

I LOVE FBA; nothing beats throwing a bunch of stuff you bought and didn't need into a box and having Amazon sell it for you, but I definitely don't sell anywhere near the 40 items a month that Amazon recommends I be selling in order to be a ""pro merchant"" and be charged $39.99, monthly.

Amazon Fulfillment Web Service	"Re: GetInventorySupply - identify if fulfilled by Merchant or FBA
Josh,

Thank-you!

Here is the issue.

When the item goes to zero on FBA which I detect with GetInventorySupply we then remove the item
from FBA to be fulfilled by merchant by uploading the item data using AMTU.

However when we want to send new stock to FBA we need to update the inventory listing (done via
seller central) for the shipping labels and this changes the fulfillment to FBA even though the stock isn't there.

Therefore after we ship I want to put it back to being fulfilled by merchant till the 
inventory arrives.

What I noticed with GetInventorySupply is that it doesn't seem to differentiate btw an item 
which is fulfilled by Merchant and FBA (Both show zero quantity).

Thats why I""m looking for some data element which will indicate that its FBA so I can switch it back to Merchant.

I think the information you're looking for will mostly be found in the ListInboundShipments and the ListInboundShipmentItems operations.At the moment, AFN listing issues are only reported on SellerCentral on the Inventory Amazon Fulfills page."

3dcart store with CBA and FBA. CBA works and communicates perfectly. FBA not at all. I have repeatedly checked my access keys and all seems to be well. I am using my AWS keys in the ""Amazon FBA"" Plugin within 3dCart. 

I get the message: ""The AWS Access Key Id needs a subscription for the service."" in the notes for any order. I am assuming that means there is some sort of communication, and it's just a config problem. I believe that I have tried all of the methods seen in the forums including setting us SES but to no avail. 

Does anyone have any insight? I am losing my mind and my client is losing his patience.

BTW, I also checked the billing with AWS. All is and has been good. I have emailed and spoken on the phone with several reps (free customer service obviously) and they all say our account is in fine shape and have no idea what that message could mean. Amazon blames 3d cart and 3d cart blames Amazon. I'm sure it's something that I am overlooking but I am obviously beyond helping myself at this point.

Amazon Fulfillment Web Service	"Re: Can Amazon FWS be integrated with Ebay, PayPal or ProStores?
I'm certain that we could integrate Ebay with FBA. (ie Grab your eBay orders and submit them to FBA for fullfillment, and then grab the shipping/tracking data from FBA and use that information to update eBay directly so that buyers who look for shipping status in MyEbay will see the latest tracking info.

If SolidCommerce has an API for retrieving orders and submitting shipping/tracking data, we could use that API to integrate SolidCommerce with FBA. If SolidCommerce has no such API, but they have the capability to export orders via CSV data files and import shipping/tracking data via CSV data files, then we could make something like that work as well.

Call or email anytime.. I'd be happy to brainstorm with you what might be your best approach overall.

We are looking to solve order/inventory/tracking management across multiple marketplaces- our primary warehouse being FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon).
1ST PIECE-

We receive 10 pcs to FBA, of which 10 are made available to sell on the amazon marketplace automatically.  We also sell that same sku on eBay and have that sku listed on ebay at 10 pcs.  In real time (or as close to it) as items sell on either marketplace we are looking for a solution that would adjust the active quantity of the sku.

Amazon listing:
Sony Playstation video game package-initial qty 10
3 sell.

Ebay listing:
Sony Playstation PS3 video game package brand new in box- initial qty 10
2 sell.

Ending qty: 5 sitting in amazon.  System needs to update that ebay listing has only 5 pieces, and same for amazon.

Amazon Fulfillment Web Service	"Re: MerchantServiceQuery Error with Inventory Template
Hi N. Corporation,

I'm sorry to hear about the trouble you've encountered.  It is nice of you to include the complete error message you received.  That type of detailed information can greatly assist in most troubleshooting situations.

Based on the error message, it simply sounds like you need to subscribe to the ""MerchantQueryService"".

I can confirm that there is no such service provided by AWS.  All services of AWS are listed here:

http://aws.amazon.com/products/

That being said, I tried to see if I could find more information about that service so I could at least point you in the right direction.  The only remotely helpful clue I could find was in this documentation covering transitioning from AIM to MWS (both of which are services provided by ""Amazon Services"", not AWS):

https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/02/mwsportal/doc/bde/AIM_to_Amazon_MWS_Migration_Guide._V180902185_.pdf


It's mentioned being used for Order Fulfillment and Canceling Orders which is discussed on pages 9 and 10 of the PDF.  Since the context is one where the reader would be transitioning to using MWS, my best guess is that the MWS team many know about the ""MerchantQueryService"" and may be able to assist you.  With that in mind, you may want to try posting your question in the MWS forums for assistance:

http://www.amazonsellercommunity.com/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=43

I'm sorry I can't provide more specific guidance with the MerchantQueryService.

Hi,

The request you provided was a ""Marketplace Web Service"" Fulfillment API request, not an ""Amazon Web Services"" Fulfillment API request. I know the difference seems minor, but this forum is about the AWS version of the APIs. The newer, MWS version is supported at http://www.amazonsellercommunity.com/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=43. Maybe they can help you?

One thing I notice that might be relevant is that it looks like your timestamp is to greater than a second's precision. Historically, for the AWS version, those have been rejected as not conforming to the standard format AWS uses. Can you try with a timestamp only to 1 second's precision?

This is Raja Ramadass from Monsoon and we are one of the integarators of amazon marketplace services. Few of our customers have reported that while sending their product to FBA through shipment, they are getting missing dimensions error from FWS API. 
Please see below for an example. 
ERROR Monsoon.Core.FBA.FBAProvider - Exception getting ShipmentPreview for [sku: 3955, quantity: 1]. Amazon.FWSInbound.AmazonFWSInboundException: Value Invalid parameter for parameter UnknownSku is invalid. Reason: Invalid shipment items. InvalidItems[ (skuType={Enum::MSKU}, sku=3955, reason=MISSING_DIMENSIONS)]. 
at Amazon.FWSInbound.AmazonFWSInboundClient.Invoke[T](IDictionary`2 parameters) 

We recommend our sellers to provide dimensions data for the product on the amazon.com site when they encounter this error and then try adding the item to the shipment. Our understanding is that product data such as item dimensions are associated to the asin /product and not to the sku. However based on our customer reports and our testing, we have found that the dimensions are only stored 
at the sku level and not at the product level. We were able to prove our theory with the following test 


We have attempted to send the item with asin B0023QXCG8 to amazon fulfilment center by creating a shipment through the FWS call 
Missing dimensions error was thrown by the GetShipmentPreview call. 
We have added dimensions information by creating a listing with sku jewel001_loc and attempted to add that item to a shipment and the operation was successful 
When we tried to send another item (same asin asin B0023QXCG8 ) with a different sku say jewel001_usf, we could not add that to a shipment and it failed with missing dimensions error 
We deleted the previously created listing (sku jewel001_loc ) and added another listing for the sku jewel001_usf and provided dimensions information for that sku 
After this, we were able to add the item with sku jewel001_usf to the shipment successfully 


Please let us know whether this is a bug or an expected behavior and based on that we can make appropriate changes to FBA shipment creation process in our product.

Amazon Fulfillment Web Service	"Regarding FBA revenue calculator for big inventory
Hi,

Iam a seller with growing FBA inventory. Iam not sure this is correct forum. I have tried to find correct department after best technical abilities but this is really not my area of expertise and I hope some one could direct me to correct department or atleast in a good direction.

I have already contacted amazon seller support with below questions but yet not recieved anything helpful. 

To my question then. For bigger sellers who list alot of SKUs, what is best practice for finding out exact fba fee for each asin? Going trough fba calculator one by one is very tedious and time consuming for big inventories (1000+ SKUs). Variable fees like comission varies from 6-15% depending on category and our products are scattered over many categories. Weight based fees and 30 day storage are also variable, thus makes it impossible to just setup an equation in excel. Finding out our breakeven price after FBA fees for each asin is critical for us to decide minimum selling price or in deciding our margin inpact.

If we have our cost price in csv file for every asin, is it possible to fetch exact fees for all asins in the file?

Please advice ASAP. This is a very big issue for us.

Best regards"
Amazon Fulfillment Web Service	"Re: Regarding FBA revenue calculator for big inventory
I'm afraid we don't currently offer anything like that to see what you would be charged. You would need to do the calculations yourself.

Amazon Fulfillment Web Service	"MWS migration workflow questions
Hi
I started looking over the FWS to MWS migration documents and am a bit alarmed at some of the workflow changes.  

Our primary workflow is labeling our items (one by one from your perspective) and then creating an inbound shipment at a later point in time.  Our stations to sticker items and create inbound shipments are completely different stations in the warehouse and sometimes in completely different physical locations.  So it is not possible for us to combine these two steps.  I'll also add that we are dealing with lots of unique items that each get their own fnsku (~500k). It doesn't seem right to be creating a new shipment each time we need to register an fnsku. But anyhow, there doesn't seem to be any other option with the new API, so I'm trying to understand the new workflow around registering fnskus and creating inbound shipments.  

1. If this is a new item (or its condition has changed), I need to call CreateInboundShipmentPlan for the single item, passing over merchant sku, condition, and asin.  
2. CreateInboundShipmentPlan returns an fnsku which we label the item with and store in our database.  And now I need to store DestinationFulfillmentCenterId and ShipmentId for each item in our database too?

And now this is where I'm lost.  Let's say we have a pile of items labeled with fnskus ready to be shipped (also consider many fnskus that may have been registered with the old API), what do I need to do in order to create a new inbound shipment for them?  I don't really understand the workflow in your guide.   Is there anyway just to create a brand new shipment for the items and not have to deal with all this complexity around looking at existing inbound shipments and the destination for each item, etc?

Thanks,
Chris"

Amazon Fulfillment Web Service	"Shopify and Shipping Options (free shipping? International Shipping?)
Hi,

I'm working on integrating my Shopify ecommerce store with my Amazon account. I currently have stock in inventory at an Amazon warehouse.

I was looking at the Shopify Wiki on Amazon FWS/FBA:  http://wiki.shopify.com/Help:Preferences#Fulfillment_by_Amazon

I have three questions from this:

1: International Shipping A significant percentage of my customers are International. The Shopify Wiki claims FWS can't do international shipping:


Note: Only Amazon USA is supported. Amazon only ships within the USA.

Items configured to use Amazon Fulfillment can ONLY be shipped to US customers via Amazon. See here: http://aws.amazon.com/fws/


Is this true? I can find nothing on the aws/fws documentation that says Amazon can't ship internationally.

2: Free Shipping The Shopify Wiki also claims that FWS can't do free shipping:


Shipping Methods

    * Standard Shipping
    * Expedited Shipping
    * Priority Shipping 

These must be weight-based rates and can have any non-zero $ value. Specify the weight range that you want to cover for each of the 3 rates. For example, you could have:

    * Standard Shipping 0-50lbs $25
    * Expedited Shipping 0-50lbs $50
    * Priority Shipping 0-50lbs $75 

and also

    * Standard Shipping 50.1-100lbs $55
    * Expedited Shipping 50.1-100lbs $75
    * Priority Shipping 50.1-100lbs $100

I interpret this to mean that I can't offer free shipping, and I must calculate shipping based on weight, but I want to offer free shipping based on how much my customers spend (free shipping for orders over $20). My items are very light, so I'm not concerned about weight.

3: Shipping Options/Carriers Finally, given the previous quote, I am curious about the differences for Standard, Expedited, and Priority Shipping. I assume my customers want to know how quickly each option is, and I want to know how much each option will cost, as well as who the carrier will be. The wiki claims I need to set shipping rates:


Additionally...

Amazon DOES NOT return shipping rates automatically, so values for the rates MUST BE SET in Shopify.

I'm fine with that, but I need to know an estimate for each option to a given location so that I can extend those rates to my customers. This is particularly true for international, as well as priority and expedited shipping options.

Thanks for any feedback on this topic!

-Martin

Amazon Fulfillment Web Service	"Re: Shopify and Shipping Options (free shipping? International Shipping?)
Hi,

I'll try to address your questions in order.

1. FWS does not currently support international shipments. On-Amazon sales of your FBA inventory can be shipped internationally if you sign up for that service on SellerCentral.

2. FWS will always charge you for shipping based on the FBA Rate Card. FWS has no interaction with your customers aside from sending whatever you ask us. If you want to pass this cost on to your customer (or not), that's up to you.

3. The GetFulfillmentPreview operation will allow you to display, for each order, when we believe each shipping speed will arrive, just like we do on the Amazon.com website.

The shipping speeds vary for each country, and exceptions can apply (which is why we encourage using GetFulfillmentPreview), but, in general, in the United States:
Priority: 1 business day
Expedited: 2 business day
Standard: 3 - 5 business day

I hope this helps."
Amazon Fulfillment Web Service	"Re: Shopify and Shipping Options (free shipping? International Shipping?)
Thanks Josh,

That helps a lot, and I really appreciate the rapid response. I have some follow up questions:

1: What does FWS do for International Customers? If FWS doesn't support international shipping (please add this feature, and soon!) what will happen if a customer of mine puts in an international shipping address? If I have to handle all international shipments manually, that's OK (for now), but I need to make sure the orders are still going through, and preferably be notified when there is an order that FWS/FBA can't fulfill.

2a: Shipping Rates I will redirect this question to the shopify staff, since I'm confused why the shopify wiki says it must be weight based, and must be a non-zero value. Based on your comment, as long as they're named ""Standard Shipping"" ""Expedited Shipping"" and ""Priority Shipping"" then they will ship as such from Amazon, no matter what I charge my customers.

2b: Shipping Titles I want to add transit time estimates to the shipping options. Can I title my shipping options with the estimated deliver times? Such as ""Priority Shipping: 1 business day"" or must it be ""Priority Shipping"" verbatim? I want to be compliant with Amazon FWS, but also provide my customers with the requisite information.

3: GetFulfillmentPreview I didn't know about this function. Thanks, I'll look into it further.

Edited by: whenitpours on Sep 8, 2011 1:08 PM"
Amazon Fulfillment Web Service	"Re: Shopify and Shipping Options (free shipping? International Shipping?)
Hi,

I'll try to answer your questions in order.

1. I don't know what Shopify does. If you were placing the order through SellerCentral, AWS, MWS, or feeds directly, the order would be immediately rejected by our systems. (GetFulfillmentPreview would also reject the order.)

2a. I don't know if the names matter. You'll need to ask Shopify. Our APIs specify the names, but Shopify may handle that integration for you.

2b. Again, there's no reason (from Amazon's perspective) why you can't do this, so long as the names you pass to Amazon are correct. You'll need to ask Shopify.

3. I hope it helps.

I want to be able to verify I've built the API call correctly, but I don't want Amazon to actually fulfill the order.  Is there a standard way to generate test orders?  Thanks."
Amazon Fulfillment Web Service	"Re: How to send 'test' data?
Right now, there's no way to flag an order for testing. You can submit purposely invalid orders to make sure that you're integrated correctly. You might use invalid SKUs, invalid ZIP codes, or SKUs for which you have no inventory, for example. These should result in error messages that indicate exactly those problems, rather than any other issues.

If you'd like to make sure everything is working and that the orders actually ship, you may want to send in some ""test"" inventory that can be shipped. This, though, will result in an actual shipment (and fees).

I hope this helps."

1.) This statement does a good job of expressing our concerns:


We need an automated way to correctly plan, order, and ship product to the Amazon fulfillment centers.  For those who manage their products through Seller Central, the tools exist, but the manual involvement is prohibitive for sellers with a large number of SKUs or a high volume.  Given the sophistication of the remainder of the FBA interface, this seems like an extremely restrictive omission.


2.) We’re looking for software that has the following features;


a.)     In order to accurately forecast “coverage needs” we need to know the average sales of an item on an hourly, Daily, 3 day, Weekly and Monthly basis (or Custom range). It needs to forecast how many units we sent, and recommend how many to send back out to FBA based on item sales for a given range of time.

b.)     It would be helpful to know the total sales (from all sellers) of each ASIN item

c.)     Once we have an accurate way to forecast coverage needs we would need the software to have a “minimum in-stock level.”  If this minimum in stock level is breached we want to receive an email alert

Amazon Fulfillment Web Service	"Re: Seller Central account vs. AWS account
Hi,

Thanks for trying FWS AWS out. As discussed in the Getting Started Guide (http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/fws/latest/GettingStartedGuide/), you'll need to sign-up for AWS using the same e-mail address and password as the merchant's user-name and password on Seller Central. It may be best to ask your clients to sign up for the AWS account and share the keys with you. There is no way to link accounts between AWS and Seller Central other than this.

The developer accounts in Seller Central are for the Marketplace Web Services (http://developer.amazonservices.com). There is a version of Fulfillment Web Services available for the Marketplace Web Services as well. This MWS version provides the same functionality as the AWS version, and, in the future will provide additional functionality beyond what the AWS version provides.

Amazon Fulfillment Web Service	"Re: GetInventorySupply Shows Zero Inventory
It seems that the Access Key you are using is not tied to any merchant account for Selling on Amazon. Thus, we are replying with a default response that you do not have any inventory, no matter what SKU you ask about.

Please remember that, when using the Fulfillment Web Services, your AWS developer account and your Selling on Amazon account must have the same e-mail address and password. Further, in order to use the Fulfillment Web Services, you must also be registered for Fulfillment by Amazon."

That makes sense.  I'll go back to my account and try to get it sorted out.  Thanks!

Amazon Fulfillment Web Service	"Re: GetInventorySupply Shows Zero Inventory
I have the same experience and got good answer after I used my AWS access keys. Now I got good inventory reply using FWS API. However, when I tried to query for any merchant sku that I can find at www.amazon.com, I got 0 reply. Sorry, I am a newbie to FWS. I believe you guys know this as basic. Anyway, example is I input 001588588010 in Amazon website and I get Lego Batman the Videogame & Pure. Using the FWS API, 

$request = new Amazon_FWSInventory_Model_GetInventorySupplyRequest();
invokeGetInventorySupply($service, $request->withMerchantSKU(""001588588010""));

I got 0.  If I use FBA-001588588010 which is how we name our own SKUs, I got actual inventory count. Does this mean I cannot access info of other vendor inventory? I want to how much stock others also have so I can order from them when my count is 0. Do I need other Amazon web services to accomplish this?"
Amazon Fulfillment Web Service	"Re: GetInventorySupply Shows Zero Inventory
You cannot access other vendors' inventory."
Amazon Fulfillment Web Service	"shipping cost
I want to get shipping cost. When doing ItemLookup with ShippingCharges as ResponseGroup, it returns null. Any other means?"
