AWS Storage Gateway	"EC2 File Gateway with ephemeral storage after stop/start cycle
Hello,

I'm trying to use a File Gateway for our latest project.  I'm launching an i3.4xlarge and using the NVME SSD ephemeral storage for the cache.  It sets up okay and we can create and mount the share.  If I stop and start the File Gateway instance, this is no longer the case -- I can access the instance, but the File Gateway is marked offline and I cannot mount the share.  This is not the case when using an EBS volume for the cache, instead of the ephemeral storage.

I'm aware of the requirements around preventing data loss when using ephemeral storage on a gateway, but in this instance I don't care -- I specifically care about what appears to be a loss of configuration across stop/start cycles.  Is there a solution to this please?

Thanks!"
AWS Storage Gateway	"Failed to set local disks when trying to setup a new disk for upload buffer
I have a storage gw with 2TB cache and 1Tb upload buffer (working fine)
I turned off vm and increased the size to 3tb cache and 2.7TB upload disks on the VM. 
Went back to AWS console and saw both disks: cache disk is showing the updated disk (3TB) -- good there, but I won't be able to save the upload buffer disk. I keep getting ""Failed to set local disks"" when I hit Save.

I deleted both disk and re-add them to VM (just to test it out). same issue as above.

Any suggestion?

AWS Storage Gateway	"Issues connecting to AWS Storage Gateway Tape Library
Hello,

We use Veeam to backup our HyperV setup.  We would like to store a copy on AWS via the AWS storage gateway.  Our gateway is running on an EC2 instance.  

We are unable to connect to the AWS storage gateway via ISCSI.  We have set up port forwarding correctly in our router, and tested by firing up another EC2 Windows 2012 r2 server with StarWind.  We are able to connect to the ISCSI on the starwind EC2 instance, but not the AWS storage gateway instance.  

We have gone through the documentation and can't seem to figure out why we cant connect to the AWS storage gateway via ISCSI to our HyperV server.  veeam tech support was not much help either, they referenced the video of how to do it, but it simply does not work.  Do we need additional ports besides 3260 between our network and AWS?

Sorry if I am restating a previous issue, as this is my first attempt with AWS storage gateway.

AWS Storage Gateway	"Prevent deletion of files through shared folder
Hi! I'm new to AWS and Storage Gateway, and need some help here.

So, we need to set up a File Gateway. Files are going to be kept on S3 IA 2 months and then they will be transfered to Glacier.

1. We want to make sure that no user can delete files from cache disk, so they're not deleted from S3. The shared folder which Gateway presents might be write-only.

2. And if, for example, a user moves a file to a wrong folder, we want to grant permission to that user to delete or move that file to another folder inside the Gateway. If it's not possible, we can do this by AWS console.

Which is the best way can we address first point?
We can use Versioning if it's the only way.

AWS Storage Gateway	"Re: Prevent deletion of files through shared folder
In order to meet your use case #1, you need extended ACL support that allows a user ""Write"" but no ""Delete"" access. Currently File Gateway only supports basic POSIX ""rwx"" permissions. 

Until File Gateway adds support for extended ACL, your only option is to use versioning on your S3 bucket."
AWS Storage Gateway	"DNS Problems with File Storage Gateway (Join Domain)
Hi There,

I recently created an file gateway in AWS, and now trying to add SMB shares.  Instructions explain adding to the domain, but I get an error ""The gateway cannot connect to the specified domain"".  This is in a VPC that has a site to site VPN so all ports are open.  A forum post indicated that this was because my VPC uses the default DNS servers in DHCP.  I tried changing the DHCP option to include my domain name and DNS servers.  

By doing that, I lose connectivity to the gateway itself.  When SSH to the gateway instance it can't resolve the 3 endpoints anymore (due to the early DNS server change).

It appears like you DNS server can either resolve the hosts in the internet (client-cp.storagegateway.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com) or your internal domain controller. In order for this configuration to work, your DNS server should be able to resolve both set of hostnames.

Alternately, you can use the AWS CLI to invoke JoinDomain operation by specifying the IP address of your DomainController using the parameter ""--domain-controllers"".

AWS Storage Gateway	"Storage Gateway - why are virtual tapes so big?
I work for a very small cost sensitive organization with only about 5 TB of data to be backed up. Currently I am using Backup Exec 20, which only natively provides access to S3 Infrequent Access. Apparently for Glacier access I need to use the Storage Gateway.

And yet it does not appear that the Storage Gateway is going to significantly reduce our costs, and may in fact cost more, depending on how many restores need to be done. I am looking very specifically at the virtual tape size, which seems to be locked at a minimum size of 100 gigabytes per tape?

So if I am reading this correctly, if we need to do a restore of a single 100 kilobyte Word document from a virtual tape in Glacier, the gateway needs to download a 100 gig tape so that Backup Exec can restore from that tape. Looking at the cost calculator, this costs US$0.25 for a slow bulk retrieval plus US$9.00 for the data transfer out.

So this one tiny restore job will whack us for $9.25 for the job. Having to do multiple occasional small restores like this can become expensive very quickly.

It would be much less expensive for us to do restores if the virtual tapes could be 1 gigabyte or 500 megabytes each. The tape software is not going to care that I need 5000 or 10000 of these small virtual tapes to do a full data backup.

With a virtual tape size of 500 meg, it now fits within the monthly free tier for transfer out, and so a few restores here and there would not cost us much at all.

So why is there minimum virtual tape size of 100 gig?  Is there some way to muck around in the Storage Gateway virtual machine configuration to allow for much smaller virtual tapes?

Edited by: Jibby on Feb 15, 2019 9:10 AM"
AWS Storage Gateway	"Re: Storage Gateway - why are virtual tapes so big?
Jibby:

Storage Gateway pricing is based on the amount of data you store not the provisioned capacity of the tapes. So while the minimum tape size is 100 GB, you are not charged based on the size of the tapes you provision.

More specifically, we meter storage by the byte and prorate the per-GB charge. That is if you only store 1 GB of data on a tape with 100 GB of capacity you will only be charged for 1 GB of storage (or less if the data is compressible). If you archive this tape to Glacier, and then need to retrieve it you will be charged for (at most) 1 GB of retrieval.

AWS Storage Gateway	"Re: Storage Gateway - why are virtual tapes so big?
Assume that I am using the normal 100 GB virtual tapes. I do a 5 TB backup to tape, which produces 50 virtual tapes that are 100% used.

Later I need to restore a 100 KB file from one of these 100% used tapes. How much of the tape is downloaded to access that 100 KB to do a restore?

In the unfortunate situation that a small file happens to span two 100% used 100 GB virtual tapes, how much of those tapes needs to be downloaded to access that file?

The virtual tape software has no idea how a given backup program has stored data on the media so it seems it would have to download the entire tape regardless of the size of the data to be restored."
AWS Storage Gateway	"Re: Storage Gateway - why are virtual tapes so big?
In the case where you need to restore 100 KB from a full 100 GB tape that you have archived, you'd to retrieve the 100 GB from the archive (Glacier) into the library (S3), and then the gateway would download whatever data your backup application requests from the tape (to the local cache). If the 100 KB file spanned multiple tapes that had been archived then you'd need to retrieve Nx 100 GB to the library (S3) and the gateway would download whatever data the backup application requested.

Archival of tapes is driven by the backup application through the policies you configure to eject or export a tape from the library. In this regard to backup application is aware if the tape can be immediately accessed or if it needs to request the tape to be put back into the library (in the real world this often equates to bringing the tape back from an offsite vault, which takes time and often has a cost). The backup application allow you to configure what remains in the library, and for most customers this is the data that they are most likely to want to restore, such as the most recent nightly or weekly backup. In the end you need to balance your business needs for ongoing cost saving in storage with the cost to restore based on the likelihood you will need to restore the data, and then configure your backup jobs to support this business objective.

In practical terms, the price difference between archived tapes and library tapes in our N.Virginia region is currently $0.019/GB-month (library: $0.023, archive: $0.004/GB-month -- https://aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/pricing/#Tape_Gateway_pricing). The cost to retrieve a tape from archive is $0.01/GB so if you needed to do this restore more than once per month it would be more cost effective to leave the tapes in the library rather than archiving them.

Hello,
we are testing AWS File storage Gateway and we've faced same problem that was already mentioned here : AWS SG is a software appliance on VMware ESX, completely accessible from LAN (by ping), with connectivity tests to the cloud completed successfully, but Amazon web console recently started to show it as offline.

Sure,

If I knew the foreign endpoint IP's (at Amazon) I would be able to tell my router to direct any traffic destined for Amazon to go out via my backup circuit.   

Allowing the traffic to go out via the primary circuit is not desirable because the volume we have to send out combined with the amount of traffic we experience this time of year will oversubscribe the circuit and interfere with operations.  

The ability to take advantage of a second, dormant circuit for back-end operations like this is probably not uncommon.

mborb:

Using File Gateway will implicitly delete your files when local storage is needed for new files.  There's no explicit delete needed in this cached model. That is, if you write files to File Gateway through NFS or SMB the gateway will cache on the local disk and upload them to S3 as objects. Data will be deleted from the cache when space is needed to store more recently read/written files, so the amount of data that remains on-premises is determined by the size of the cache disk attached to the gateway.

I have an AWS Storage Gateway running via ESXi on a HP microserver. I have a physical Windows 10 machine mapping to a file share that points to an S3 bucket.

What I was expecting when I copy a large file from the Win10 to the mapped drive, it would copy across at LAN speeds to the VM, and then StorageGateway would do its magic in slow time the S3 bucket. What I am seeing is it taking approx 20mins for a 300MB file to copy across. I originally thought it was a LAN issue, but I am not starting to think that it is uploading straight to S3, and only reads are via the cache...

Can anyone confirm that this is whats happening and that's the way AWS has designed storage gateway to work. If so I may need to rethink my use case and solution.

Thanks"
AWS Storage Gateway	"Re: Do files cache locally before uploading to S3
Bradc,

Your understanding of the gateway behavior is correct. The files that are written to the gateway are saved locally in the cache disk and they are uploaded asynchronously to S3. 

Since you are seeing poor write performance, we suspect the issue to be with the network throughput from the Windows client and the Storage Gateway or the IO throughput of the Cache disk. Can you please look at the the network & IO throughput metrics in ESXi?

Please PM me your gateway ID and the AWS Region, we will look at your gateway metrics and share additional feedback.

Thanks,
Shashi"
AWS Storage Gateway	"Multi-Facility Usage of Storage Gateway?
I am sure this question has been asked.  I promise I searched for it first!

Is it possible and practical to leverage Storage Gateway services to implement a multi-facility file share?  We maintain large amounts of critical project data at local facilities in various states.  It is becoming more important for the various facilities to have access to this data as a global resource.  Secure storage (Amazon) is also important.  Having a cached storage gateway at Amazon and then deploying the local cached storage at multiple locations such that the data could be accessed and updated from anywhere would be fabulous.  However, this may be too much to hope for.

What usage scenarios are possible that are close to this desire?

Thanks!

Keith"
AWS Storage Gateway	"Re: Multi-Facility Usage of Storage Gateway?
Hi Keith,
Currently, any data shared between multiple gateways must be done via snapshots.  You can't have two gateways concurrently access the same storage volume.

But would be great to learn more about your use case.  I'll PM you.  

Thanks,
Arun"
AWS Storage Gateway	"Re: Multi-Facility Usage of Storage Gateway?
I don't know where this PM happens...  but our situation is as follows (and doesn't seem particularly unique):

We have a local ""projects folder hierarchy"" that is organized by project managers.  Projects are organized by ID number, and need to be retained forever.  However, only the most recent year or so requires  low latency access.  Since the data includes large CAD files and such, though, ""local"" access is needed so that the files can be opened/examined/modified using various software tools.  We have developed S3-Based facilities to automatically move suitable projects (those that database information indicates are not likely to be needed anymore) to S3 and to delete them from the local store.  The project managers can restore these archived projects easily if they are needed.

The above sounds like an excellent problem for a Cached Storage Gateway solution.

In addition to this, company expansion introduces the need to establish similar large project folder hierarchies at other locations, some in other states and a few in other countries.  The nature of the data still suggests the need for there to be a local cache so that these remote project managers need quick access, too.  Furthermore, there are cases where sales happens in one region but project management happens in another region - thus, the project folder hierarchies really need to be available in multiple places (obviously there is some ACL aspect of this, but...).

Summary:  The ideal solution would be an Amazon-primary storage with multiple cached instances in multiple locations that would all inter-sync.  But, we know that this isn't actually what the Storage Gateway is designed for.  And that is understandable.

Perhaps a cached storage gateway for each geographic location combined with some project-targeted to synchronize selected data between regions would work.  In this case, I have probably wandered outside this forum's scope (with apologies).  But if anyone has solved this problem or has some enlightened idea (particularly using storage volumes) I would love to hear about it!

AWS Storage Gateway	"Re: Multi-Facility Usage of Storage Gateway?
Did you ever get a reply? I would love to know the solution. I have a similar use case."
AWS Storage Gateway	"Re: Multi-Facility Usage of Storage Gateway?
The problem isn't really an AWS one. Given they are presenting iSCSI LUNs rather than an actual file share (NFS / CIFS / etc), the problem is how would you even have two systems writing to the same NTFS (or whatever) volume at the same time?

There are solutions to this like HP PolyServe, Redhat GFS2 or something like that to get to the point where you're not going to corrupt the file system by having two servers access the same disk, but even then you haven't really solved the problem of file locking, etc.

The only thing I can think of is if you have several completely separate AWS Cloud Gateways, and then link them at the front end (on the server) using DFS/FRS, GlusterFS or some other sort of Distributed File System. You'd have a lot of duplicated data in AWS is the downside.

It may be worth a look at Nasuni. I know they have the concept of Read-Only replicas of shares which can be presented in multiple locations. I think it's expensive however (even though they still use AWS S3 at the back-end)."

Multi-master would also be a massive enhancement for our usecase as well."
AWS Storage Gateway	"AWS Volume Gateway High Availability Clustering and Local Logs
We love the concept/idea of this product. We have a scenario where our local NAS/Archived Storage is becoming stressed on space even with a local Archicing/Stubbing solution in place, about 120TB of data. We have tested out the Volume Gateway in our environment and it works well from our testing. The ability to send files to an ever increasing amount of space in S3 while caching highly used/recent files locally is great.

The problem is for an Enterprise Grade solution, we see a couple flaws that are preventing us from pushing forward with this solution:

High Availability - With the SG acting as the frontend for clients/servers to deliver files to, what happens if the SG encounters any service disrupting issue? This could be crippling to an environment relying on those files for their production apps to function. I know with VMware HA this can help a little but doesn't cover everything. Having a second Volume SG in sync/replicating/load-balancing in a cluster is the ideal solution to this.
Local Logs on the SG - We think it would be very helpful to be able to see login to the console as ""sguser"" and see read-only log files related to SG server/activity. If/when there is an issue, at least you would be able to login locally and parse the logs to try and diagnose what may possibly be at fault vs waiting for Amazon support in a critical production down scenario. This way, it doesn't just appear as a magical black box sitting out there working wonderfully to utilize S3 storage.

To my points above, does Amazon have any plans to roll out High Availability (HA) clustering of the Volume Storage Gateways? Also, will we ever be able to see read-only logs related to the SG server/activity when logged in to console as ""sguser""?

Hi

We have a problem with Storage Gateway joining the domain via CLI (version: aws-cli/1.16.93 and aws-cli/1.16.90).

AWS Storage Gateway	"Join Storage Gateway to Domain by IP Address?
I've searched all over, but can't find mention of this... Can I specify the IPs of my Active Directory Domain Controllers in the 'domain joining' action when creating a Storage Gateway? This is what we do when domain-joining Windows instances (we do this with some Powershell UserData).

As it stands, the instance has to be able to lookup the AD domain name (so if your AD is called ""ad.example.com"", the instance tries to look up ""_ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.ad.example.com""). If the DNS lookup fails, then it can't join the domain. To do the lookup, it has to use the correct nameservers.

Is there any way (or any plans to add the feature?) to allow me to say ""my AD servers are at IPs X and Y""? This would greatly simplify the infrastructure required around the Gateway to get it to join the domain.

As it stands, the only solution I have found is to set a DHCP Options set on the VPC that specifies the two DCs as the the nameservers, configure the VPC to use this set, then create the Gateway and then optionally put the DHCP Options back the way they were.

Since I don't want to have to make VPC changes just to instantiate an instance, I'm now looking at ways we can keep the DHCP Options pointing to the DCs - but this requires lots of Route53 associations with the remote account that hosts the Domain. Again, not an attractive option.

1) AWS can transfer NFS files, or iSCSI volume to AWS S3/EBS, as I know of. Can it transfer local NFS volumes block by block to AWS S3/EBS? If no, what products/services can do that?

If you're trying to transfer files hosted in an NFS server to AWS, the best service offering we have is AWS DataSync which can copy your data from your NFS server to S3 or EFS.  Details can be found at the link below.  When you're copying files via NFS you're using a file level protocol (rather than a block level protocol like iSCSI) and can't do a block by block copy regardless of what product/service you use.  AWS DataSync does perform an integrity verification after the sync operation to ensure that your data was copied correctly, if that is your concern.

https://aws.amazon.com/datasync/

If your goal is to get your data into EBS then your best choice is a Volume gateway where you copy your data to a volume of 16TB or less, take a snapshot and use that snapshot to create an EBS volume.  I can provide more details on this if you want.

Hi Paul,

Many thanks for getting back to me, this is very useful to know.

I am trying to double check that the files we have transferred into AWS storage have actually copied correctly (currently using rsync). In this particular case, the copy was being managed between an S3 gateway and an nfs mount across a ssh-tunnel so there was some worry about the integrity of the transfer (I know there are other S3 transfer mechanisms, but this is the situation we were in). The ability to verify the checksum stored in S3 without having to re-read the object would have been useful.

AWS Storage Gateway	"Re: Using a EC2 Volume Gateway
Hi mnino,

I was wondering if you have checked out all the networking and firewall requirements available at the Storage Gateway user guide link below.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/Requirements.html

Specifically, I would recommend to check out the ""Configuring Security Groups for your Amazon EC2 Gateway Instance"" section.

Please let us know how it goes. If you have followed all the steps and it still doesn't work, I would recommend to file a ticket with the support team so we can have your issue looked at by our experts.

AWS Storage Gateway	"What happened if the network between storage and AWS is broken?
If I use file storage gateway to transfer local application to AWS over Direct Connect. If the DX network is broken, I have several questions to ask?
1. Will the application be stopped when storage gateway can not connect to AWS?
2. I think the application will continue to write data to cache disk until the cache disk is full. Then what will happen?
3. When the network connects again, will storage gateway automatically sync the un-transferred cache data to S3?"
AWS Storage Gateway	"Re: What happened if the network between storage and AWS is broken?
xiaweidong:

Thanks for your questions.

1. The application won't be aware than the network between the gateway and AWS is not connected. 

2. Yes, the application can continue to write data until the cache disks are full (indicated by the CachePercentDirty metric hitting 100%) at which point the application will get an error. Conversely, if your application is reading data and the data is in cache it will be served to your application. If your application attempts to read data that is not in the cache, the gateway will attempt to fetch this data from AWS which will eventually fail and return a read error to your application.

3. When connectivity is established any any data written to the gateway will be uploaded to AWS and the gateway will resume normal operation.

Overall you should consider the gateway resilient to temporary loss of network connectivity, but it is not designed as an offline storage appliance.

AWS Storage Gateway	"Moving 120TB DFS file system to AWS
We are currently in a position where we need to move our entire 120Tb DFS shared drive structure, including existing NTFS permissions off of the existing 220 geographically dispersed servers. We are intending to move everything to AWS in the short term while we prune and filter out the dross from the folders. We have in excess of 3.2 Million folders in the structure. We cannot prune in situ for a number of logistical and political reasons so we want to move everything to one pot where we can work on it.

What is the best way to accomplish this in AWS for this amount of data? I need to retain the NTFS permissions (some folders are secure) so wherever it sites needs to support NTFS natively.

Purchasing hardware to host this on premise would set us back £300k+ and we really do not have the space. Moving to AWS will be expensive, yes, but still cheaper than buying hardware. We intend to keep the files on AWS (~30Tb) once it has been pruned and the unwanted folders removed."

(i.e all offices access S3 bucket with files through nextcloud on AWS and HQ uploads\syncs files through AWS file\whatever gateway...)

AWS Storage Gateway	"Syncing Files to Storage Gateway In a Timely Manner
I have about 92 million files making up about 10TB of data that I need to move to ASG from a local nfs share. I do not have access to the underlying hardware just the nfs share itself where the data currently resides. I want to move these files to s3 though the local ASG, the initial sync can take weeks and that would be fine but I need to know of a way to do the final cut over sync in a timely way.

I think rsync would take to long to index files on the source nfs share and the ASG presented nfs share.

I'm currently investigating using netapp XCP to sync the data since it builds its own indexes and speeds up indexing a lot. 

What are some strategies customers use to do the final sync/cut over quickly ? 

I would imagine there is a process to do this as I would think this is a common need with snowball since both systems would have to do a final sync before switching to s3 storage."
AWS Storage Gateway	"Re: Syncing Files to Storage Gateway In a Timely Manner
Hello -
Did you end up using XCP?  If so, how long did it take to copy the 10TB of data?

Best Regards
Mike"
AWS Storage Gateway	"Re: Syncing Files to Storage Gateway In a Timely Manner
Hi there,

I researched a bit as this is an interesting question! 

Here’s what I found: When moving large amounts of data from on-premise to S3 it can take a significant amount of time for indexing when using 'sync' command. This can even cause the uploading process to appear as frozen. 

As a solution, instead of using 'sync' command, you can use the 'cp' command which copies the files without indexing overhead to S3 with improved speed. Although this works for newly created files, if we add files after the 'cp' command execution completes, we need to use the 'sync' command for the later added files. This works faster rather using the 'sync' command at the beginning.

If you need to create a Storage Gateway using an S3 bucket with a large number of files it can again take a long time to populate the cache in Storage Gateway.  This could be avoided by creating the Storage Gateway pointing to an empty bucket, and after that executing the 'sync' command to sync the files from the source bucket to the newly created bucket in S3. However, when accessing files through Storage Gateway, you’ll need to fetch them from S3 which potentially slows down the initial file retrieval. You can work around this by manually doing a query of files to populate the cache initially.

Since you have mentioned NetApp, another option is to use NetApp Cloud Sync, it’s a replication and synchronization service (SaaS) used to transfer and synchronize NAS data to and from cloud object storage. They support many formats, including NFS, SMB/CIFS (see https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-sync-service). If you are moving to a fully managed cloud volumes by NetApp for aws storage, you can leverage SnapMirror replication technology to replicate on-premises data to AWS. This also makes it easier to have secondary copies available for multiple use cases with high availability."
AWS Storage Gateway	"Re: Syncing Files to Storage Gateway In a Timely Manner
This is the perfect use-case for our new service DataSync:
https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/11/introducing-aws-datasync-for-accelerated-online-data-transfer/

DataSync and Storage Gateway are meta-data compatible, so transferring via DataSync and then maintaining access via Storage Gateway should give you the best outcome."

AWS Storage Gateway	"Re: Trouble Joining Storage Gateway to Windows Domain
After a lot of head-scratching, I found that the Gateway needs to be able to lookup DNS names within the AD domain name. So if your AD is called ""ad.example.com"", the instance tries to look up ""_ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.ad.example.com"". If the DNS lookup fails, then it can't join the domain. To do the lookup, it has to use the correct nameservers.

Instances (probably - unless you've changed thing) use the AWS built-in nameservers. You can change this by setting DHCP Options on your VPC. You need to create a new DHCP Options set, specify the AD domain name and the IPs of the Domain Controllers as the nameservers. Then configure you VPC to use this new Options set.

Once all that's done, any new instances will use the DCs as their nameservers. Storage Gateway will then be able to do the DNS lookup and locate the Domain Controllers to join the domain. After it's joined, you can potentially put the DHCP Options back the way they were."

AWS Storage Gateway	"File Share Stuck in ""Creating"" Status
Hi All

I have an issue where a newly created file share is stuck in creating status. I think I know why. I changed the instance type on the VM and it broke the gateway, so I deleted it, deleted the VM and started again. I have tried to recreate it 5 times, same issue. When I delete it then it also gets stuck in deleting status and I have to force delete the gateway. I think my issue exists as in the backend these aren't actually deleted and they are still there, therefore the s3 bucket is not allowing multiple connections.

Does anyone know how I can expedite this to Amazon support please?

AWS Storage Gateway	"Storage Gateway - File Gateway inside VPC with no internet gateway?
I have been searching for an answer to this and I am hoping that someone with more experience with storage gateway may be able to help please?

I have activated a storage gateway using an internet gateway. Ideally, I would like the storage gateway and file shares to be private, but it is my understanding that the storage gateway needs outbound access to the internet? Is this correct? I tried attaching a NAT gateway instead of an internet gateway, but reading the documentation I don't this will work and the Storage Gateway status was shown as ""Offline"" from the AWS management console when I did this.

I have seen some recommendations about adding the IP addresses associated with the storage gateway and file gateway endpoints to the security group for the EC2 instance running Storage Gateway. This would then limit the storage gateway to those endpoints. However, the link ""AWS IP Address Ranges"" on  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/Requirements.html#networks does not work. Has anyone achieved this?

I'm already using the Amazon S3 Gateway Endpoint as part of my routing for the storage gateway. So I'm happy that calls to S3 are not going over the public internet. It would be great to achieve this with the remaining connections that storage gateway makes, if possible?

AWS Storage Gateway	"Re: Storage Gateway - File Gateway inside VPC with no internet gateway?
If your gateway is running inside a private subnet in your VPC, a NAT gateway will allow you to connect and route traffic to the Storage Gateway service. Your gateway requires access to endpoints documented in https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/Requirements.html#allow-firewall-gateway-access.

I am having the same issue, is this a very common issue with AWS Storage Gateway?

Scenario 1: Creating a SG for the first time in AWS Console, 
below steps works fine

**Select gateway type**
**Select host platform (Download and Deploy OVF Template)**
**Connect to gateway**
**Activate Gateway**
However, problem starts at step ""Configure local disk"" after allocating Cache and Upload buffer (170GB each). ""Gateway is Active"" but ""Saving failed, please refresh local disks to see the current status"", eventually ""Unable to load local disks."". 

Refreshing doesn't make any difference. 

Scenario 2: Delete activated Gateway and re-create using the existing deployed OVF gateway in vSphere:
It fails at **Connect to gateway** regardless I use the same mac and ip address or a different IP address. Solution is to Delete the earlier deployed gateway in vSphere, re-deploy OVF template and reconnect in AWS cloud but then again I am stuck at ""Configure local disk"". 

I have created and re-created this SG more than 20 times so far and I have managed to get it working only once last night. However, this morning SG status showing offline and obviously lost the volume. 

I have checked the network connection in vSphere gateway console, test connection passes all 4, connection to different region works fine, tried setting static ip and preferred DNS or without static and dns, either way it's the same issue.

I am setting up a .NET based application on Windows servers and require a file share (SMB) for the web and application servers to access for shared files.

First concern, latency and file availability. I don't know what the performance of a file gateway would be. I know it has cache volumes but how long could first file request be? 
Second concern high availability. Storage Gateway docs recommend only one writer per bucket, so I would not be able to setup a Storage Gateway VM in each AZ.  So no redundancy. Is it possible to put in an auto-scaling group if an AZ becomes unavailable? Regardless we'll be hit with cross AZ charges with a single point in one AZ (still not sure how much this is in reality).

Hi brettski,

If you are provisioning a Storage Gateway on EC2, the performance of the gateway will depend on EC2 instance and a number of other factors. These include the network bandwidth between the client and gateway, the speed and configuration of your underlying local disks the amount of local storage allocated to your gateway, and the bandwidth between your gateway and Amazon storage. 

In general we don't recommend HA solutions such as the one you suggest, but I will check if we have any information regarding the use of Auto-Scaling groups with gateways.

AWS Storage Gateway	"Switched share from NFS to SMB, all existing folders have no write access
We are having issues with our NFS shares, so have switched one of them to SMB to see if that is any better.  However, after removing the NFS and reactivating as an SMB with guest access only, and export as ""Read-Write"", we can only create files in the top folder.  Inspecting the Security tab on a folder shows that the gateway user/smbguest account is not present on any of the existing folders.

Why doesn't the storage gateway automate the process of recursively adding the smbguest user as part of the share setup?

I only see the smbguest set on new folders/files I create at the root folder.  I tried using the icacls powershell command to recursively add it, but I keep getting the following error: ""\smbguest: No mapping between account names and security IDs was done.""

How do we recursively add this now after the fact?

AWS Storage Gateway	"Re: Switched share from NFS to SMB, all existing folders have no write access
billkg,

The behavior you observed is as expected as the permissions between NFS and SMB are different. If a customer has a use case where both NFS and SMB file shares are connected to the same S3 bucket, we don't want all the files to be available to all the users unless the customer explicitly configures the file ownership/permissions as appropriate.

In your case, if you would like to provide access to all the files written from NFS share you need to make it available as a NFS share again. After you make it available as a NFS share, update the read/write permissions appropriately so that ""other"" users have access. Then you will be able to access the files/folders as ""smbguest"" from the SMB share. 

Note that you cannot export both NFS and SMB file shares simultaneously from the single gateway pointing to the same S3 bucket. So you either create two Gateways or do the following.

1. Delete the SMB file share
2. Create NFS file share & Update the file/folder permissions.
3. Delete the NFS file share
4. Create SMB file share

Please PM me if you would like to discuss further, also please check your messages."
AWS Storage Gateway	"Re: Switched share from NFS to SMB, all existing folders have no write access
I may be mistaken as it's been a while since I looked, but I believe the permissions stored as object tags. Depending on the scope of what you need to do, you might be able to create a temporary SMB share, create some files, figure out the tags, and just use a short script to overwrite the tags directly to the files in the original S3 bucket."
AWS Storage Gateway	"Re: Switched share from NFS to SMB, all existing folders have no write access
Thanks for the suggestions.

Due to the ongoing stability issues with NFS we wanted to switch to SMB.  The SMB shares continue to stay up for days so seems like the better route to go.  

I will take a look at the tags route to see if I can fix it easily, as we had a bunch of challenges with NFS permissions to start with as well.

I will give it a shot and report back if/how I solved it.

Thank you!"
AWS Storage Gateway	"Re: Switched share from NFS to SMB, all existing folders have no write access

If you take the route of updating the tags in S3 directly, you need to invoke RefreshCache against your File Gateway to make it read the updated tags."

AWS Storage Gateway	"Tape backup to AWS - Advisable to do full backup ?
Hello people ,
  At our company we are looking at using Tape gateway/VTL to replace our on-prem Tape library .
  Backup application is Netbackup and we do full backup of our Teradata database once a week worth 50 TB ( completes in about 14 hrs) .
  Now with a 500 mbps dedicate line to AWS this upload will take days to complete . Storage gateway upload limit maxes out at 120 MBPS or about 1 Gbps . It wont help a lot even if we manage to get a 1 Gbps connection .

Have someone connected Netbackup application to multiple Storage Gateways for parallel upload ? Are there any downsides ?
Also Upload Buffer max capacity is 2 TB , but we are looking to push through about 5 TB per Storage Gateway , so upload buffer will get full from time to time , but with sufficient Cache storage Netbackup should still be able to write to Storage Gateway without failing i believe ?"
AWS Storage Gateway	"Re: Tape backup to AWS - Advisable to do full backup ?
Hi dipayan80 

The performance numbers provided here https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/resource-gateway-limits.html#performance-limits  are on a per gateway basis and provided for general guidelines based on certain test conditions. These numbers are not enforced in AWS Storage Gateway software and are driven by initiator to gateway bandwidth, ram/cache/disk/cpu on the gateway and gateway to cloud bandwidth. In practice we’ve seen customers get higher numbers, based on the specific platform they use.

We have customers using Storage Gateway VTL solution to do both full as well as incremental backups and it’s also possible to achieve a higher upload throughput by parallelizing through multiple gateways.

With upload buffer max capacity of 2TiB, you could choose to use higher cache up to 16TiB to ensure successful backup.

Hope this helps

So, we are transferring in millions... 10s of millions files into File Storage Gateway (NFS). There are lot of directories and a lot of small files ( < 128kb).

To start we can move in 1000s of files every minute, but after few hours the rate drops to 100s every minutes, and sometimes even stalls to 1-2 files per minute.

This is not the case,
For the root we have 3000 iops ( 1 TB gp2), and for cache we have  6000 IOPS per volume and we have 2 cache volumes( 2 x 2TB gp2). Since the EBS volumes are over 1TB, there should not be any burst buckets.

While the Storage Gateway is at high performance level, we do see high IOPS on the volumes  https://imgur.com/a/IwQ6jiT . You can see the root volume is at almost 1k IOPS and the cache are humming along at about 600iops.

So we are definitely within our limits. At about 7:00 we noticed HUGE drop in performance, which is not caused by going over ebs iops. On the graph you can see our IOPS drop from 1k to less than 100.

I have also managed to import and run the File Gateway appliance on Ubuntu 16.04 Virtualbox. It functions OK but I cannot see the console output in the Virtualbox window. (Looks like black characters on black screen... Only the cursor is jumping around...)

I changed the appliance network interface type from NAT to bridge. Then I set my router to forward ports 80 and 443 to the appliance IP. That way AWS was happy to connect to it.

Volume Gateway also runs fine on Ubuntu Virtualbox, using the same port forwards. Additionally the above mentioned black characters on black background problem is not experienced, console functions well.

AWS Storage Gateway	"Files and Folders in Linux NFS mount are not using uid/gid of share
I have newly created a storage gateway with NFS mounts set using all of the defaults.

When I mount the share on CentOS 7, everything shows up and can be read.  However, nothing can be written into any of the folders due to permission issues.  The share root properly is using uid/gid 65534 (nfsnobody), but all of the other folders and files within the mount and below are owned by 4294967294:4294967294, which prevents writing into any folder.

The same NFS mount on windows allows reading and writing into any folder or file.

If I open the file metadata in my S3 bucket, the x-amz-meta-file-owner and x-amz-meta-file-group metadata fields have 4294967294 set in both of them.

Based on your description below it looks like when you mounted the file share from Windows the Windows OS wrote it's permissions to the files and your Linux client lacks the appropriate permissions to access those files.  Most likely this is an issue with your squash settings on the NFS file share through the File Gateway.  I've included a link to the relevant documentation below.

Answers below
#1 - How many files are you storing in your 100MB dataset? While we do not evict the cache unless there is newer data, depending on the file size you are trying to write you may see sparse usage of the cache. The gateway is trying to mediate between NFS which favors small reads and writes (KB size) and S3 which prefers data in larger tranches (MB size).

#2 As I mentioned above, the CacheFree metric isn't an indicator of any issue as we do not evict from cache unless there is more recent data that needs to be stored for local access. 

#3 UNC paths should work, so we'd be happy to take a look at what's going on. 

#4 The gateway enforces a maximum path length of 1024 bytes; clients are not allowed to create a path exceeding this length and will result in an error if they try to do so. There is no workaround this limitation as it's is driven as you noticed by the limit on the S3 object key length.

It appears the VTL is associated with tape(s) that is / are in 'RETRIEVED' status (VTL tapes which were ARCHIVED at some point in time but later retrieved). When VTL tapes are in RETRIEVED status, they are write protected and will prevent the VTL gateway from being deleted until the RETRIEVED tape is back in ARCHIVED status.

I am trying to understand the need to archive tapes in the AWS Storage Gateway program.  I built a number of tapes, and now after about a month of usage a handful of tapes are full.  My question is do I need to archive the full tapes?  What is the issue if I just let them sit there?  My understanding is that we do not pay for tapes, only for data throughput.  If the tape is sitting in this virtual library or ""archived "" and moved to an alternate location somewhere at AWS, its still ""in the cloud"" as far as my needs are concerned, and I dont have to wait for the tape to be made available again if I need to restore.  I am not understanding some part of the process, and would appreciate clarification.

Thanks

AWS Storage Gateway	"Re: Need Explanation for Archiving Tapes
Hello Joe,

The need to archive the full tapes you have in your library depends on your recovery needs. e.g. Do you expect to need this data in the short-term for recovery purposes or don’t anticipate needing it anymore and would like to put it away for your regulatory or compliance needs?

It’s true that you do not pay for the tapes, but you will be billed for the amount of virtual tape storage i.e. data stored in the cloud by your tapes. I have included the link to Storage Gateway pricing below so you can see tape related pricing elements.  

https://aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/pricing/

If you don’t have an immediate restore need, by archiving the tapes, you will store data in Glacier at archival storage price. Some more information regarding archiving and retrieving tapes that you can also find at the link below:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/StorageGatewayConcepts.html

Archiving tapes: When your backup software ejects a tape, your gateway moves the tape to the archive for long-term storage. The archive is located in the AWS Region in which you activated the gateway. Tapes in the archive are stored in the Virtual Tape Shelf, which is backed by Amazon Glacier, a low-cost storage service for data archiving and backup. For more information, see Amazon Glacier.

Retrieving tapes: You can't read archived tapes directly. To read an archived tape, you must first retrieve it to your tape gateway either by using the Storage Gateway console or by using the Storage Gateway API. A retrieved tape is available in your VTL in about three to five hours after you start retrieval.

Please let us know if you have any further questions.

Thank you,

AWS Storage Gateway	"Edit bandwidth rate limit - greyed out in AWS console
I need to edit the upload bandwidth rate limit for my storage gateway as it is causing my business cable modem to crash for some reason (working on this from another direction, our 15 public IP address assignment setup is such that I cannot just swap it out with one from another mfg). For some reason ""Edit bandwidth rate limit"" is greyed out in the AWS storage gateway console and I cannot click/select it. Any idea why this is and how to enable it? I can limit the bandwidth through my firewall but would rather put the burden for this on the AWS storage gateway itself."
AWS Storage Gateway	"Re: Edit bandwidth rate limit - greyed out in AWS console
AnthonyG:
Edit the bandwidth limits will be greyed out in the console if your gateway is offline, you select more that one gateway, or if you have selected a file gateway. The latter gateway type doesn't currently support bandwidth limiting. It's on our roadmap for 2017.
Thanks

Is there any update? The option is still unavailable for files.

AWS Storage Gateway	"Setup error at Connect to Gateway
I am attempting to setup a file gateway. I have the VM loaded in ESX and the network and time configured. I can successfully ping and connect to the VM over port 80 from my computer using telnet. The Test Network Connectivity and System Resource Checks all pass.

However, when running through the setup wizard in the AWS console, I hit a block. I am on the 3rd step of the wizard, ""connect to gateway"". I put in the IP address, and it tries to send me to the local VM. However, I am getting a HTTP 500 error. I have tried this on Chrome and IE from 3 different computers. Any suggestions?"

AWS Storage Gateway	"Restores from NDMP Source to NDMP destination  no errors, but no data
Hi,
Pretty new to this.  I am running HyperV on Windows 2008 with Symantec Netbackup 7.5.  

Backup works perfectly.  Attempting a restore appears to run without error, completes normally, but no data is in the destination.  Both the source and destination are NetApp filers, and both are using NDMP.  

I have the source filer and the HyperV Client listed as NFS Exports on the destination filer.  

Anyone have any experience with a similar setup?  I am really under the gun here.  Any help would be much appreciated.

Joe"

Hi joe1871

Just to make sure, I see that you mentioned the source and destination are both NetApp filers where is the AWS storage gateway used in your setup?

THis was user error.  I was not formatting the path for he restore correctly.  I was able to get the restore to work beautifully once I solved this issue.  Thanks.

AWS Storage Gateway	"Backup performance and pricing of storage (tape) gateway
I am considering using AWS storage gateway for backups to Amazon S3 but I am concerned about the backup performance and the pricing.  I signed up for an AWS ""free tier"" account so I can do some basic testing and see how it would perform.  I use Veritas backup and they have a ""cloud connector"" to Amazon S3.  I know this is different than storage gateway but hear me out.

As a test, I ran a backup job of 2 GB over a 5 Mbps cable modem connection (upload speed to Internet).  It took a long time but then it eventually failed, haven’t had a chance to look into the reasons why.  Anyway, even with this small backup job, it put me at 2,000 PUT requests and 18,826 GET requests which is almost at the limit of the free tier.  That sure seems like a lot of activity for such a small job.

Then I was doing some more research and it looks like the Amazon Storage Gateway may be a good option for running backups to AWS.  It looks like there are several ways to use the Storage Gateway, the one that I’d be interested in is the Tape Gateway.  I have some questions I am hoping someone can help me answer.

With the Amazon Storage Gateway option, I read somewhere that backups are compressed and only the data that changes is sent to AWS.  I know the time it takes to backup to AWS can depend on a lot of factors but let’s just say that I was to get an Internet connection with a 50 Mbps upload speed and I was trying to do a full backup of 1 TB of data on a daily basis.  Out of that 1 TB, only 20 GB would change on a daily basis.  Let’s also say the data being backed up is mostly file server data (i.e. documents, pictures, videos, etc.) but there's a MS SQL database and also a Microsoft Exchange server database.

1.	How long should I expect for the backup to take?  
2.     How good is the compression on these backups?
3.	If the backup job is configured as a “full backup”, will the storage gateway only upload the 20 GB of changes to AWS after the initial backup?
4.	If I run full backups 3 days in a row, will I be taking up 3 TB of storage on AWS or will I only be taking up the initial 1 TB + 20 GB for Day 2 + 20 GB for Day 3 ?
5.     Would I get charged for the PUT/GET requests when using the Storage Gateway or is that included in the pricing model?

I've been working with an AWS sales rep but he's not really able to give me ANY information on what performance I can expect.  Of course this makes it very difficult to make a decision without knowing how long these backups are going to take and if this is even feasible.  I mean, what's everyone else using for an Internet connection speed and how much data are you guys backing up?"
AWS Storage Gateway	"Re: Backup performance and pricing of storage (tape) gateway
Gilbert:

Thanks for your detailed question.

1. Tape Gateway throughput is up to 120 MB/s (see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/resource-gateway-limits.html#performance-limits) which is more than your available upload bandwidth so that would be the rate limiting factor. Assuming you can utilize 100% of your 50 Mbps bandwidth, rough calculations are that the 1 TB full backup will take a little under 2 days, and your 20 GB incremental will take a little under 1 hour.

2. We use industry standard compression algorithms, and the amount of compression will vary depending upon the data being stored, so if you compress the data locally with a common tool then you should see similar levels of compression from SGW. For example, documents typically see high compression ratios whereas videos see much lower ratios.

3. No. If the backup job is configured as a ""full"" and the backup application writes 1 TB then SGW will upload and store 1 TB of data. SGW has no insight into whether you are running a ""full"" or ""incremental"", it is simply providing storage for the backup application.

4. If you run 3 days of full backups at 1 TB per day you will have 3 TB of data stored (less any reduction from compression).

5. No. With SGW you pay $0.01/GB written (with a $125/month cap) and per-GB for storage. See https://aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/pricing/

AWS Storage Gateway	"File Share - High Availability
We have a legacy application installed on several Windows EC2 instances . This application works on shared data that is loaded to NFS.  

Since EFS does not work well with Windows EC2 instance, I have planned to use Storage Gateway ( File Share ) which gives the NFS feature by default. This simulated file share seems to work as expected.

However, it appears that the storage gateway is a single point of failure ( in case the Storage gateway EC2 instance goes down or the Region/ Availability zone is offline ). What options do I have in order to mitigate this issue ? 
        1 . Can I assign an Elastic IP to the active instance and re-assign it to the secondary instance when the primary goes offline?
        2 .  Any option of using Elastic load balancer in tandem with this?"
AWS Storage Gateway	"Configuring Windows Server OS Volume in Storage, Volume Gateway
I have currently configured Storage volume gateway in Mumbai region. I tried creating a local disks, upload buffer and volumes all working fine. Even I tried creating volume with data and its working fine now. By Question is instead of adding D Drive or other drives in volume storage gateway how can I add  OS Drive to Volume gateway and take snapshots. So that incase of OS Failure, I will restore the whole server in the EC2 with my snapshots. Is it possible ? If yes what will be the best practice."
